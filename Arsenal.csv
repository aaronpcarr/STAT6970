"Just watched the extended highlights so obviously i dont have a complete picture on the game, but weirdly has made me feel better. My takeaways: 

- Saka continues to show how good he is. Seemed like our player who most looked like scoring. 
- We weren't at the races at all, weren't pressing like we normally do, weren't stopping crosses, let our man get away from us far too many times in the box which led to their goal. I don't blame √òdegaard for it because he's just been outmuscled by a strong CB and there needed to be someone else on marking duties. Not sure if tiredness or a mentality thing, but Everton showed way more fight.
- Everton deserve credit, probably deserved to win by more rather than us deserving a draw. 
- Arteta will be very disappointed at the duels we lost.
- We seemed uncharacteristically flustered in possession.

Fielding a team of physical players and slogging it out with them is exactly what they want; it would be playing not only their football on their terms, but into their hands. At that point, you're no longer even trying to wrestle a pig, you're just LARPing as a pig in a fight with an animal who was born that way.

Even on a case-by-case basis, it doesn't make sense. Think of the players we put out who are routinely praised for their physicality.

"Everton took a couple of lessons off of Newcastle.  First, 5 across the midfield during our build up, which makes Zinchenko's invert easier to deal with.  Second, doubling every winger because we play to feet so often with our wide players.   In both games we weren't able to create an advantage out of the double.  

Zinchenko is an important player in this team, but in these situations I think KT is more helpful.  Our wingers are isolated by design, but Saka has more support from Odegaard.  Xhaka does a lot of things well, but supporting a winger is not one of them.  Also, when a team is sitting in a 4-5-1, I'd like to see 5 attacking players across the opposing back 4 and play the long ball from time to time.  Part of the logic in that block is that Arsenal will retain a stubborn adherence to principle.  Gabi should beat Coleman in a footrace, but we never gave him the chance to run on to the ball.  

When the midfield is running well, my maybe we continue and breakdown Everton, but each of our midfield 3 was uncharacteristically off it.  White also was just not with the program - similar to Newcastle.  

I liked how Arteta dipped into the bench and showed confidence in Vieira - the player needs that and the team needs him as a contributing member.  Probably just walking a well worn path against a familiar foe, but if you aren't taking Zina off to change the left side, you have to take Xhaka off.  It's a shame ESR isn't fit, and there's no sign of that happening for a while.

Wash our hands of it and rebound.  How the team reacts to this game is now wayyy more important than what happened in the game.",Arsenal,No,j7axc2z,t3_10u7b9u

I can't put all the faults of Gabby missing, but he does drift wide and help Gabi out a lot. With Zinny inverting like he is and Xhaka not really overlapping a lot, Gabi is left 1v1 or 1v2 most of the time and it isn't helping him.",Arsenal,No,j7csxfl,t3_10u7b9u

- There are no easy games in the PL
- I think we got too cocky about the title. These are games which can determine title races.
- Everton are full of individual quality. Just lacked a competent manager
- Midfield needs to be play better
- WTH are we doing during set pieces?
- We should absolutely consider starting Tomi and Trossard. Their competitors have been very poor in recent games
- New manager bounce is a reality. It has happened many, many times in recent years at least within the PL

"The Martinelli ""not getting support"" thing. Don't forget that when our whole team is tilted towards Saka's wing, so is Everton's entire defensive shape. So Martinelli is almost freed up to recieve the big switch ball. Something which happened a few times and Gabi didn't take full advantage of it.

It might be by design and maybe even the rest of the squad didn't do enough to switch the ball to Gabi more often, so he can be more dangerous. 

That picture doesn't convey the whole story.",Arsenal,No,j7airvb,t3_10u7b9u

If even casual fans can guess he is just going to the corner, then do you think he stand a chance against professional footballers who study how to stop him. It just used to work before, everyone just figured it out now. He needs to add more variety to his game. 

Also, the team might lean right, but that is actually a good thing for Gabi. He has more space to dribble. Imagine if saka has more space on right, he would be balling there.

We have Tomiyasu who is far better going forward on the overlap for Saka than White, although he may be a bit less techincally able. 

We have Tierney who can provide more traditional LB play to overlap with the LW. Tierney starting will balance out the lopsided attack which is causing problems attacking down the LW.

We have Trossard who may be a better playmaker than Gabi. Gabi has had a tough time with his decision making recently. He often runs the ball out for a goal kick, or doesn't know what to do once he gets into the box. 

Starting the same 11 every game makes us predictable and teams will start to figure us out. Yesterday should be a wakeup call that we can't win them all if we play the same way every game. We're not untouchable in our system. It works 80% of the time, but when it doesn't, or perhaps more importantly, when Arteta *thinks* it may not work, we have to have a bit of flexibility.

"I'm usually an optimistic person so sorry in advance for the doom & gloom.

To me, this Everton game was a game bigger than most, it was the yardstick with which to judge if this team can actually go the distance, it would tell us more than Man Utd or Spurs imo and this is why:

* The narrative was easy for the players and the manager to understand. We've struggled at Goodison in the past, we've struggled at stadiums when the crowd gets going, we've struggled against low-block teams and we've struggled against teams that want a physical game, that's the stereotype at least. This game was a banana skin for us to all outsiders, much more than any other non-top 6 game this season. They knew and we knew exactly what does game would be like, the players and the manager knew for certain. BUT we still made the same mistake we made against Southampton this season, and against others last season. It's okay to lose when you're outplayed, that wouldn't mean much to us now, but yesterday we were outfought. We weren't up for the battle.

* The focus was on the Man City game for us, for the neutrals and for the media. I'm certain it was the same for the club too (no matter how much they repeat the ""game at a time"" mantra). Again, in these big games, it's about controlling the narrative. We go in to that game with a 5pt lead and a game in hand, ALL the pressure is on City to come to the Emirates and win. They HAVE to win. That puts us in such an advantageous position. Now the whole narrative has flipped, if they win their games (as is expected) and we had just one small blip, we'll be a 2 points ahead of them (game in hand won't matter anymore to the media and others) so the focus and narrative in that game now will be can Arsenal avoid dropping into 2nd, the pressure from the outside has shifted.

* Man City are struggling this season in their dressing room, at a key turning point for them, we've unfortunately dropped points which I fear will rejuvenate and motivate their players now, give them a believe at a key stage that they can overcome us, even if they're underperforming.

To end on a more positive note, we were always the underdogs this season and the players have shown that they can overcome extremely difficult obstacles already, even if we've made things more difficult for ourselves. Let's go on a run and see what things look like again in a few weeks.",Arsenal,No,j7ajsun,t3_10u7b9u

"""Martinelli not getting support"" is not true or the reason he's been trash for weeks

Martinelli right now is Pepe except if Pepe always tried to run to the byline instead of always trying to cut inside

When defenders know you are no threat in one of the directions, they can cheat and take an extra yard in the direction they'll know you go, so you can't even rely on being faster than them to beat them

Until Martinelli becomes a cut inside threat, he will continue to lose all of his full back duels. The only games where this doesn't apply are when there are spaces to play the ball in behind the defence, which for us are few and far between

He is a pure pace and power winger right now and it is not fun to watch at all. Trossard probably starts next game 

In terms of the rest of our season, the game plan to nullify us is obvious - 4-5-1 with 3 big athletic runners who can back up full backs with the wide midfielders and still press the whole game. We don't have the personnel to beat it atm. Joelinton-Guimares-Willock and Gueye-Onana-Doucoure. How many other teams have a midfield 3 like that? If the answer is ""none"" we're fine",Arsenal,No,j7aler8,t3_10u7b9u
"i just have these questions about our signings if we're not going to use them. everton had fifteen points before this game & we knew they'd be hard to break down, so why not try trossard and vieira in place of martinelli & xhaka on the left? we couldn't account for things like the team generally not playing well, but vieira and trossard offer a lot more when it comes to tooling a defense. people might say vieira ode partey is a risk, but come on, they had fiftteen points; you can't trust your players to play these games, why did you even get them in the first place? 

arteta's always been a bit inflexible, and it was fine when we didn't have a fuller squad, but at times it's just gonna cost us and it happened yesterday. case in point, tomiyasu with two strong showings can't get a start despite ben white being off recently. not sure what the thinking is behind that. arteta needs to start modifying the game plan just a little bit to compensate for the different strengths of different players. 

that being said, we were bound to lose a game. if we win fifteen of the next seventeen, we'll get over ninety points; our toughest games will be the city fixutures, but i truly believe we can still do it. all it takes is a bounce back against brentford, which we are more than capable of.

Sunday dinner really hitting different in this one‚Äôs household. Levels,Arsenal,Yes,j7cb9tg,t1_j7cad0k
"This is why we need Jesus back asap. He really commands a lot of attention from defenders with his movement when he is on the pitch and frees up Martinelli and Saka. As Arteta himself said previously, Jesus ""causes chaos"".",Arsenal,Yes,j7ch8jt,t1_j7cghec
"I'm all for teams playing a back 6 and hoping to try and beat us by scoring off a corner.

It's not some genius strategy.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ci7dv,t1_j7cghec
He got a knee injury.,Arsenal,Yes,j7cuiuz,t1_j7cqard
"Spurs couldn't generate the same aggressive physical pressure on our midfielders. That's the ticket, along with a good block and doubling up on Saka. Physically, Spurs don't have the likes of Bruno/Longstaff/Willock/Joelinton or Onana/Gana/Doucoure, and unlike Everton and Newcastle they didn't try to match our numbers in the middle.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cuu55,t1_j7ctcyg
"We make fun of Spurs playing a back 5, but they still had 2 or 3 players higher than Everton, who only ever had DCL.

Lloris also made the mistake early so they had to open up.

If we score early on Everton it's not a close game.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cu8ru,t1_j7ctcyg
"Leeds as well - we seem to struggle a bit against tough, hard pressing physical teams. We don‚Äôt have a huge physical presence in the middle of the field, √ò for example can be a bit lightweight at times. 

*I know leeds are crap but they were very good against us.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cy336,t1_j7ctcyg
spurs played 2 man midfield and are usually defending from very deep,Arsenal,Yes,j7d2ley,t1_j7ctcyg
Because Spurs aren't as well drilled and they play wingbacks meaning they can't use wingers and fullbacks to double up on our wingers like Everton did so well,Arsenal,Yes,j7d6d86,t1_j7ctcyg
Liverpool fans claiming this is a weak season makes them look worse‚Ä¶. Do they know this?,Arsenal,Yes,j7d81g6,t1_j7d5jd7
"Can't believe the Man U fantasies. They are much much better under ETH but they're still miles off us and city. Add to that of their two transformative midfielders, one is out for the season and the other has a 3 match ban, I don't see them coping too well with that.",Arsenal,Yes,j7d8a7y,t1_j7d5jd7
Imo Man Utd were never outta the title race anyway. One result doesn't change it that much. Don't think they'll win it but they'll be up there in the last 2-3 games of the season I think,Arsenal,Yes,j7d9ror,t1_j7d5jd7

"While you make some decent points, I don't fully agree.

There must be a reason why Arteta decided to bring on Fabio for Odegaard and not Xhaka, even though both Odegaard and Xhaka had a bellow average performance. Physicality is not everything, but it is important.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aujnt,t1_j7arzd1
"They were pressing man to man in the first half, how do you avoid the battle.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ati0m,t1_j7arzd1

I think we just need that extra bit of quality in our forward line.,Arsenal,Yes,j7aso38,t1_j7arzd1
Yeah but we need to actually win the title for it to even be the start of a cycle,Arsenal,Yes,j7achyr,t1_j7ac1qs
A stadium we haven't won in 5 years + Sean Dyche + new manager bounce,Arsenal,Yes,j7ae8pb,t1_j7ae686
"Think the big disappointment for me is it slightly negates the great win vs United because we could have swapped the results and been in the same position.

But it doesn't have to be any more than that. We were miles off it, wasn't our day. They were totally fired up. And that's it, we move on.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ahta5,t1_j7ahaea
We should try tierney lb zinny 8,Arsenal,Yes,j7b1805,t1_j7axc2z
"To be fair, Dyche has played this way for years and it was to be expected.

I think most of us knew that this game would be a battle, especially in Goodison. What's disappointing is that the team would have been aware of what was in store for us and yet we couldn't do anything about it 

Tactically we need to improve in these type of games because we'll be seeing more of them now that we're at the top.

Agree that we should use this game to improve our game and look for a reaction against Brentford. A good result there will set us up nicely for the City game, which will be massive",Arsenal,Yes,j7azp1k,t1_j7axc2z
"Tomi needs to be starting at RB against teams with fast/physical attackers

"It's a tough one because we did need an overlapper, yet Zinchenko was our best passer. Maybe Tomi earlier for White, though that's not really his strength either.",Arsenal,Yes,j7b123t,t1_j7axc2z
When we win vs Brentford it‚Äôll be back to overwhelmingly positive.,Arsenal,Yes,j7b4oxf,t1_j7b4cyz

"Saka still doing bits so I don‚Äôt think this is the case tbh. Also, Xhaka does drift to the left side a lot ‚Äî who assisted the cross to Eddie‚Äôs first goal vs Manure? Xhaka from the left wing.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cv1y9,t1_j7csxfl
Exactly - it‚Äôs the dynamics. It‚Äôs not the player.,Arsenal,Yes,j7d6af1,t1_j7csxfl
"I would argue we sagged notably when Thomas came off, and Everton looked a lot more comfortable from then on-- and I've been arguing that Jorginho was shrewd business from the first.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aqty1,t1_j7anru2

"We don't even need 'someone more defensively sound than Odegaard'; if Arteta had an √òdegaard clone, we'd be playing and enjoying both of them across the top of our midfield.

It's such a clear area of need.",Arsenal,Yes,j7bmz48,t1_j7bk6lq
"I don't understand how anyone can put any faith in them after last time. If we want to win, then we pick ourselves up and do it ourselves.",Arsenal,Yes,j7bnf2i,t1_j7bmfpm

Our schedule also looks easy but we have more anxiety because we care more about us,Arsenal,Yes,j7crun3,t1_j7cpezl
"Not really. They have plenty of really tough fixtures ahead. Spurs, Newcastle, Chelsea, Liverpool and Brighton away and they end the season against a bunch of team‚Äôs that will be clawing their way out of relegation. Also, their best player just got banned for 3 matches, they‚Äôll drop points at some point",Arsenal,Yes,j7crxes,t1_j7cpezl
Well they play 8 matches over the next month and we only have 5. Should be interesting to see how they cope with many midweek fixtures.,Arsenal,Yes,j7cv3hj,t1_j7cpezl
"It probably should be opponent based.

Vs United we had absolutely no issue moving the ball up and getting shots with our usual setup.

Vs Everton we did.

I think its fair to say Mikel made a mistake not trying to change our shape vs Everton.",Arsenal,Yes,j7dgwss,t1_j7dfn20
"But, but, Giroud is one of the greatest strikers of his generation!!!

The fact that he would go on huge goalless droughts for Arsenal and couldn‚Äôt be counted on to consistently score even the clearest of sitters is the fault of the players around him, and that he had no backup!!! It was never his fault!!!

He was world-class, and we didn‚Äôt appreciate him enough!!!

\\s

Yeah, I don‚Äôt think so.

Giroud wasn‚Äòt a total scrub, but he‚Äôs gotten waaaaaay the hell overrated by the revisionist history merchants on here. He‚Äôs the definition of good on his day, but never great on any day (let alone world class lol).",Arsenal,Yes,j7d25qq,t1_j7cw2iy
"What a joke from the mods. I remember the threads in there when we lost against United earlier this season, doubt they gave out many bans despite hundreds of similar comments.",Arsenal,Yes,j7c9gwy,t1_j7c90yq
"They changed the rules tbf

"The mods there are brainless bums, dont be too bothered about it. You will always have a home, and it is here.",Arsenal,Yes,j7casfl,t1_j7c90yq
You act like it‚Äôs something new? There is always an agenda and double-standard when it involves us ‚Äî both negatively and positively.,Arsenal,Yes,j7ca4bn,t1_j7c90yq
"I like this.

Next weekend I‚Äôm hoping we do the business and get ahead start on City that play late on the Sunday. With our game being at home - should be a nice advantage.

Get ahead early next week and hopefully get the team mentally and physically ready. Could be a challenge though as Brentford are the inform team.",Arsenal,Yes,j7d6z30,t1_j7d49bc
He was right though. He saw Maupay was holding his head when there was no head contact. I was confused until I saw the replay and realised it was actually really good reffing. Wish they did it more often - players defend timewaste by taking advantage of that rule.,Arsenal,Yes,j7admh1,t1_j7adbw2
"Haha, I felt a little unwell reading this.",Arsenal,Yes,j7bq5bv,t1_j7bq23a
I think 3+ and no injuries will doing it honestly. Once they get into the CL which pep is obsessed with I can see them lose focus in some games.,Arsenal,Yes,j7cfeej,t1_j7ce7il
"Worst part is, if they win, we‚Äôre gonna sit and agonise over the 11 point lead we could‚Äôve had. I‚Äôll still take the potential for 8 points, though. Come on, Sp*rs.",Arsenal,Yes,j7as212,t1_j7arac7
He is not injured. Arteta just wanted to play with Jorginho...,Arsenal,Yes,j7av9j8,t1_j7auznd

Not to mention their kits are consistently awful,Arsenal,Yes,j7c17z9,t1_j7c12sl
"It makes sense why a lot of Americans support them. Spurs always seen as a smaller club but have big club potential. Those people want to pick a team that's not too good or too shit, they want in the middle. Works both ways with Brits and American sports.",Arsenal,Yes,j7c4cxg,t1_j7c12sl

"Right there with us and City. Might need a bit more depth but with added PL money it would be addressed. 

Took them to win the CL at 14/1 and it's down to 11 now.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cnel7,t1_j7cn23k
"yea the problem is if its not birghton, its gonna be someone who we dont want there. And while Brighton could do it, I don't feel its all that likely (although 538 has it around 28%). 

Brighton getting in would be lovely, both for us and in general it would be a great story.",Arsenal,Yes,j7df5uh,t1_j7dco4g
"they will strengthen even if they miss on UCL (I think they will finish in top4, they play really good now), just look at Chelsea spending, nothing will happen in case they miss out on UCL. But would be great for us if they go to EL",Arsenal,Yes,j7dhcdo,t1_j7dco4g
"I feel the same way, Tottenham might as well get in there because they still have that debt from the new stadium they'd have to worry about. Just in this decade they will fall off because they won't be able to match Manchester United's commercial revenue or Chelsea's warchest.

Meanwhile United would get a possible +¬£80 mil, which if they had it this season, they could have possibly brought in someone other than Wout Weghorst this season. Who knows, with that extra cash, they might have been the one with Felix, not Chelsea.",Arsenal,Yes,j7dm39q,t1_j7dco4g
Yes. Anything less than a City win makes the weekend a lot less bad for us.,Arsenal,Yes,j7ad5vc,t1_j7ad1te
"Me too. It‚Äôs just the inevitability of it that gets me, and there was nothing we could do to stop it. The narrative, the script, went EXACTLY as I feared and it‚Äôs frustrating watching it unfurl in front of your sorrowful eyes üò≠",Arsenal,Yes,j7anv08,t1_j7alhhb
"I was about to type this exact comment lol it didn't feel bad yesterday but looking back on it it's quite a shameful loss especially with that ""Dyche is ard"" nonsense",Arsenal,Yes,j7amxdy,t1_j7alhhb
"I agree, or even try Trossard there. The two games we've had recently against defensively organised teams Newcastle and Everton there were moments where quicker decision making and movements were needed in that position.

 I just think Xhaka can sometimes be too slow to turn and the chance is cut out, or it gives time for the defending team to get back in their shape",Arsenal,Yes,j7bib3r,t1_j7bhkxo
"I agree. Pep has just started away from home against a top 6 opposition playing silva and alvarez on the middle with Lewis inverting

Xhaka has been brilliant in the first half of the season (and he will have his uses going foward) but this is the next stage of evolution imo",Arsenal,Yes,j7bpvge,t1_j7bhkxo
"I think the bigger difference isn't skill but the fact the Saka isn't as isolated as Martinelli is. Look at the heatmap from yesterday's game, super right leaning. Plus, Saka has √ñdegaard and White next to him who has been like the teams best players (disregarding the last games) this season.",Arsenal,Yes,j7bv8lp,t1_j7bu0ta
I love Zina and his ability to play as an inverted full back but it really makes him very 1 dimensional and easier to delegate if he doesn't overlap at all in games.,Arsenal,Yes,j7buiyl,t1_j7bu0ta
"Martinelli needs to improve in that aspect or he needs to be replaced. Trossards first touch, decision making, and chance creation has not been a problem in the little minutes he's seen in the team.",Arsenal,Yes,j7bv8hk,t1_j7bu0ta
I think the key to Martinelli getting more into games is ESR playing and in form.,Arsenal,Yes,j7c3ncn,t1_j7bu0ta
"who cares

stop lurking their sub and reporting back. Happens so much in this thread",Arsenal,Yes,j7c8tq2,t1_j7c8je6
"Your right! Not one player didn‚Äôt anything particularly wrong, we were just of the pace as a team, it happens we move on, still 5 points clear imagine saying that at the beginning of the season lol",Arsenal,Yes,j7aikhu,t1_j7ai5za
"We should've went in for him in last summer, 30M is a bargain in todays market.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ax9cb,t1_j7avhjz
I didn‚Äôt want him and still don‚Äôt. He completed 24 passes the whole game. It‚Äôs one thing being a midfield destroyer in a team that values broken play and regaining the ball into space and another thing completely to do the things we ask partey to do.,Arsenal,Yes,j7axzpw,t1_j7avhjz
"He did. I watched the first half of that game and Rice was amazing. He and Paqueta completely controlled the midfield and the Hammers defence was really solid. I don‚Äôt expect them to have a bad second half of the season, but we should be all in for Rice this summer.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ajm23,t1_j7agb9l
"If we were 8 points behind right now and the top team had a game In hand, I doubt those same people would be saying we're in the title race. Mad how interested some Arsenal fans are in trying to create a 3 horse title race.

Personally hope everyone bigs up United now so we can laugh when they collapse again",Arsenal,Yes,j7ci9c1,t1_j7cflz0
Man U are as much of a threat as city.... whoop whoop whoop!,Arsenal,Yes,j7cg4ul,t1_j7cflz0
"Man utd are in it, the season is unpredictable and they have a good squad and form.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cjkl4,t1_j7cflz0
"The set pieces defending was shocking yesterday, every corner they got felt like a penalty",Arsenal,Yes,j7ak9cp,t1_j7ac526
"Agree. That's two poor matches in a row from White. Not gonna hammer the guy, he's been great most of the season. But in a competitive top level team when you do that, the guy behind you gets his chance, and if he steps up he keeps the shirt until such time as he loses it.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ahpqt,t1_j7ahhal
"Christ almighty of all the shit takes I‚Äôm actually surprised this one has reappeared. 

Well done. You have actually done something original in the shit take arena that is the daily discussion.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ait2k,t1_j7ahhal
White is a better overlapper than Tomiyasu.,Arsenal,Yes,j7arvlq,t1_j7ahhal
"It's not a physiciality issue. Spurs and Brentford didn't cause us problems this season.

They both played a 4-5-1 shape and doubled up on Saka and Martinelli. Our only real central creative threat is Odegaard. Martinelli didn't really receive much support creatively or movement wise.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aqr5h,t1_j7am00a
"Teams that don't want to play football are always a weakness for teams that want to play football if the ref is one who let's things go. Simple as. It's too easy to just smash someone and kick the ball away, then feign injury. Everton would have been happy with a draw.",Arsenal,Yes,j7amj57,t1_j7am00a
">Are physical teams a big weakness for us?

no other wise we'd have lost or drawn to more of them.  Expertly organised low blocks and lokonga are the weaknesses.",Arsenal,Yes,j7anuww,t1_j7am00a
It's why I rather we get Caicedo and Rice instead of another silky 8 for aesthetics. Modern football loves players that grind.,Arsenal,Yes,j7ap7h3,t1_j7am00a
We have a bad habit of loosing drawable games yeah we may regret this if it's this close,Arsenal,Yes,j7b3pex,t1_j7b157x
"It's Osimhen or no one in that case but we don't really need to blow 100m on a striker when we have 3 perfectly good ones already.

We need to use the whole budget on midfielders in the summer.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aj1wj,t1_j7agjfl
"While good, caicedo is not the saviour you think he is - he is not Partey 2.0, he's not on that level yet",Arsenal,Yes,j7ajhxw,t1_j7aj62d

It‚Äôs not zinchenko a fault it‚Äôs because Eddie is one dimensional and struggles to drop deep,Arsenal,Yes,j7blso1,t1_j7bkkjt
Doesn't mean you played badly but... we still did yesterday imo. Everton executed their plan way better and even when we had possession we didn't perform.,Arsenal,Yes,j7ct2rk,t1_j7cp3jj
Good take.,Arsenal,Yes,j7cqcco,t1_j7cp3jj
"You need physical midfielders or highly technical midfielders, nothing else",Arsenal,Yes,j7amr9i,t1_j7ambut
"At home it‚Äôs not such of an issue. I think we‚Äôll cope with Brentford (I don‚Äôt underestimate them though!). Away from home I totally agree, we need a plan B",Arsenal,Yes,j7annwl,t1_j7ambut
He‚Äôs really fallen off. If he weren‚Äôt a Spud I‚Äôd be bummed,Arsenal,Yes,j7c2aqh,t1_j7c22so
Sharpest downfall of any recent top player. Even Salah is having a better year,Arsenal,Yes,j7c2cwq,t1_j7c22so
Where is Alvarez going?,Arsenal,Yes,j7c9nm7,t1_j7c2ttt
"That opens the door for commercials, I think they just need to add more extra time",Arsenal,Yes,j7c4m1m,t1_j7c3zf0
It will be so funny when they go away to Leicester on Saturday and get smashed.,Arsenal,Yes,j7cbcw6,t1_j7c8zsp

"No. Injury riddled season with less goals and way less expected goals than Eddie. ¬£80m for a player with better ball striking but not much else better than Eddie.

There is also a very real possibility all Juve players get suspended for their personal involvement.",Arsenal,Yes,j7dhweh,t1_j7dhct5
"hell no! what a bullet dodged if he joined id have stopped supporting arsenal, hate him like xhaka does",Arsenal,Yes,j7dk6hp,t1_j7dhct5
Rather go for Osimhen or Goncalo Ramos if we do need to buy,Arsenal,Yes,j7dje37,t1_j7dhct5
Avoid Juve players getting suspended,Arsenal,Yes,j7dm5mq,t1_j7dhct5
"Yes. If we add him he's instantly the second best striker in the league behind Haaland. He's a complete forward. There's a reason he was 1a to Jesus' 1b. He offers something different to our striking options. 

But I would say before I look into Vlahovic I'd be examining Locatelli and Kulusevski as possibilities first. Just simply higher priorities as Jesus/Nketiah are already very good options.",Arsenal,Yes,j7dmbxj,t1_j7dhct5
"Odegaard, Zinchenko and Partey all had shockers against Everton and they‚Äôre the ones who need to have a real look at what they contributed to here.  

It‚Äôs just easy and apparently popular to blame Martinelli (there‚Äôs even a guy claiming Ben white was poor down below lol). 

This sub just goes on whomever is the east target. There‚Äôs no real analysis.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ajzk3,t1_j7airvb
"Interesting. Was watching the game on Bein and could hear Arteta shout Gabi multiple times. 

Maybe he expected more from him when there was a lot of space to be exploited.",Arsenal,Yes,j7an5i8,t1_j7airvb

"He is struggling because the dynamics around him suck. He just ends up doubled teamed - contrary to what he heatmap implies about him having more space to operate. Zinchenko and Xhaka are too stiff blud.

"Nah Kane will be remembered. England captain, potential PL all time top scorer. But he will always be noted as winning 0 club trophies",Arsenal,Yes,j7d003o,t1_j7cwzyj
"Yea no he isn't, he's going to finish as England's top scorer by a good amount probably, and I think he'll go to a bigger club (UTD) to try and win a title. I also think England have as good of a chance to win the Euros as any other country so he's still got an opportunity to increase his historical standing. It is okay to admit other players are good, even if they play for Spurs.",Arsenal,Yes,j7d02qu,t1_j7cwzyj

"I‚Äôve personally seen mostly top-six fans rooting against us. Have seen quite a few non-EPL and mid table fans on r/soccer saying they want us to win.

I mean, if it was between Chelsea/Spurs and City, wouldn‚Äôt you want City to win? As opposed to a Madrid or Crystal Palace fan, who just want things to be different and exciting.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aw0a5,t1_j7at9h5

"Basically just Man United, Chelsea and Spurs fans. None of them want us to win. They are our 3 biggest rivals, and have been at the front of the queue to banter us during our bad years recently. Now that we are playing amazingly and our London rivals playing like shite, and Man United playing better but still below us, they absolutely seethe it and cannot stand our fans being happy lmao. Wankers the lot of them and it‚Äôs just peak jealousy and bitterness. Liverpool and City fans would rather us win the league than any of that lot, but obviously they are competitive rivals still, City fans obviously want to win the 3 peat title achievement and equalise their biggest rivals. I‚Äôd argue most non big 6 teams fans and non-epl supporters would want us lot to win the PL over any of the other big 6 teams though, probably because of how little success we‚Äôve seen over the last 20 years.",Arsenal,Yes,j7b010l,t1_j7at9h5
"Our online fan base is fucking annoying, as are those of the other big clubs. City has less online presence so their fans don‚Äôt come across as entitled / insufferable.

"I think City is the just too soulless for people to care. So all the other traditional top 4 fans prefer they win. Why? No fans to gloat. Being a fan is bragging rights and you don't want someone with numbers to have them.

"Maybe he does, you never know. That match reminded me of the Wolves match where a moment of magic from Jesus unlocked their backline after 70 mins of nothing. 

And you have to stop taking any sentence that doesn‚Äôt say Eddie is the perfect player personally.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ay8bl,t1_j7awz1p
"We were below the level across the pitch at Leeds too, but got a goal thanks to a moment from Saka. I don't think it's unreasonable to wonder whether Jesus's combination play and dribbling might have helped us unlock something with our wingers doubled up, even if only in one or two decisive moments. It's definitely not a slight to Nketiah to say that some situations call for Jesus's particular skills.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ay0uq,t1_j7awz1p
"To my mind, what would have potentially helped is not one instead of the other for the whole 90, but the change from one to the other, which might have shaken things up-- or even possibly having both on for a time.

Which is more or less exactly what you'd want from two good strikers in a squad.",Arsenal,Yes,j7axdk6,t1_j7awz1p
"Would've been nice to have the option and it highlights just what we're missing with Jesus being injured. Far too many saying that he hasn't been missed too.

Agree that a win seems unlikely but we could've came out with a draw, who knows.

Anyway, he won't be back for sometime and we should really be happy that Eddie has done as well as he has in the meantime. Definitely wouldn't knock him in any way for our team performance yesterday",Arsenal,Yes,j7ayx3u,t1_j7awz1p
"I think yesterday was a perfect game for Jesus though. Away from home in these kind of pressure states he has been huge. 

Even experience & intangibles aside, he offers so much quality dropping deep whilst still getting an absurd amount of touches in the oppo‚Äôs box. Eddie is gaining a lot more confidence in receiving the ball from deep but Jesus is at such a level with it that it has chances to stretch their midfield completely, which I think was the area which stifled us most. 

If even just one of their midfielders has to worry about Odegaard & Jesus, then they‚Äôre in a pickle. Eddie isn‚Äôt quite there in that regard yet, whilst still being a fantastic striker",Arsenal,Yes,j7b1m66,t1_j7awz1p
Jesus absolutely wins us that game lmfao what? Wolves away was the same sort of game as yesterday and he single handedly created our first goal there,Arsenal,Yes,j7bbkht,t1_j7awz1p
"I think the United Vs arsenal matches were good this year. Arsenal Vs Liverpool too (both that and Man United were 3-2 to us so lots of excitement for neutrals). But I get it with Liverpool Chelsea 0-0 recently, Chelsea Man United 0-0.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aih01,t1_j7ai406

"What? If City lose our position is better than it could‚Äôve been, idk about you but I‚Äôm gonna feel some pretty intense relief. It would also bolster the team‚Äôs confidence, I think. City drew Everton at home under Lampard and would have lost to Tottenham, who we did the double over. Proves we can beat them",Arsenal,Yes,j7c1yt6,t1_j7c0mzj

"He has immense physical attributes, the talents there he needs someone who can put it all together - and I think Howe is the right man for it.

"I dont think *flooding* alone does much.

Everton did that while also positioning their wingers close enough that they could shake hands with their full backs.

If you want to play basically a 4-5-1 out of possession, it's so, so tough to get the ball up the pitch and have over 30% possession.

Everton had 27% possession and were fine with that as long as they didn't concede.

That's not a sustainable way to win football matches. 

They worked hard on the day, but if you told me teams were going go park the bus and allow us to have 75% possession I'd sleep easy.",Arsenal,Yes,j7dczs9,t1_j7dc5ww

"I'm not really worried about teams playing 10 or 11 behind the ball and having a full back and a winger deep and effectively playing a back 6.

Subbing Gabi and white makes sense, because our backups seems capable enough to replace them. But if we are chasing a game, how can we replace odegaard with viera and keep xhaka on.

"City finishes below top 4 , he will leave the next day.",Arsenal,Yes,j7c7e2c,t1_j7c6w8s
Some National team perhaps.,Arsenal,Yes,j7c76sy,t1_j7c6w8s
"It's too late now, you can't relocate games at such a short notice

I think our FA cup game was too close to this midweek because we needed it free in case there was a replay against City",Arsenal,Yes,j7cb0vd,t1_j7c7al7
"Newcastle looking really fucked without Guimaraes, is he out for a while? I can‚Äôt see them staying in the top 4 if they play the way they did yesterday without him",Arsenal,Yes,j7aul34,t1_j7ar2jg
"Yeah, Newcastle and Liverpool also dropped points to relegation canditates. It happens every now and then.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aucdp,t1_j7ar2jg
Often it‚Äôs easy to point out these things with hindsight but I tend to agree here. A bit of extra height wouldn‚Äôt have been a bad thing with the amount of balls Everton were putting into the box. Have got to think about Toni‚Äôs excellent stats in aerial duels when it comes to set pieces too.,Arsenal,Yes,j7aok0f,t1_j7an9kw
Three more to draw if we get a repeat performance,Arsenal,Yes,j7bx8e9,t1_j7bwnnx
"Agreed. So far the result is in isolation. We have dropped points against United, Southampton and Newcastle, but they were in isolation - plenty of wins seperated  these matches. 

That‚Äôs why the Brentford game is highly important, because the next match after that is Man City. It‚Äôs one game at a time, but the atmosphere going into the City game will be grim if we have not beat Brentford.

This is where Arteta and the players need to keep focus. Get the team huddles going again and get back to playing with no fear. We were fearless against Man United, but to timid against Everton",Arsenal,Yes,j7ajzw5,t1_j7aj53c
Partey‚Äôs pass competition is like 90% this season why are we making shit up now,Arsenal,Yes,j7apeu5,t1_j7ap0qo
It was heaps worse yesterday. Even ode over hit 4-5.,Arsenal,Yes,j7aq4gw,t1_j7ap0qo
"Well I think it's the simplicity of some of the passes that we're missing that makes it more noticeable. If it was long balls, etc. then that would be understandable, but it seems more basic passes we were hitting earlier are being missed.",Arsenal,Yes,j7arlb1,t1_j7ap0qo
"Of course. Nothing is over until it's over. I hate Arsenal fans acting like we already won the league as much as the doom & gloomers.

Never mind they've not won there for like 5 years now.,Arsenal,Yes,j7c6g1o,t1_j7c641l
"Actually I don't even think it was about overlapping. I wanted more hoofballs over Coleman's head and exploit his lack of pace vs Martinelli but Zinny was too focused on keeping possession and vertical grounded passes.

Saka caused a lot if trouble to Mykolenko when we went more direct and long to him.",Arsenal,Yes,j7agbav,t1_j7afsa5
"That was last season. The dynamic at City is different now. They lost 3 games all last season, they have already lost 4 this year",Arsenal,Yes,j7cfzsw,t1_j7cdfnb
"They aren't favorites. They haven't been favorites since early December. Their is not a single book on earth that would give you this.

If you think they are favorites, you basically have the betting opportunity of the year.

This City team just isnt as good as previous years. Their defense is trash. Walker, Lewis and Ake as full back options is poor.",Arsenal,Yes,j7chmge,t1_j7cdfnb
As mentioned by the other poster. We are the favourites. The bookmakers literally price us the lowest odds to win the league this year,Arsenal,Yes,j7ci8cn,t1_j7cdfnb
The asymmetry is intentional though,Arsenal,Yes,j7djegn,t1_j7ddhex
"Its not over at all lol. We dropped points against Southampton also, and went on a great run after. For some reason we struggle against the worst teams? Maybe its because we get a bit complacent while they feel like they have nothing to lose.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aj07z,t1_j7ada20

Harsh on Gabriel as well.,Arsenal,Yes,j7aeob5,t1_j7ae44p
"White was really, really bad for him. Gave the ball away 4 or 5 times basically unforced. One of his turnovers nearly led to their goal. Seemed to give up on a couple of through balls, didn't impact up the pitch. Not a good day for him.

√òdegaard, Xhaka and Partey were also far off. Thought Eddie had his worst game for us since he came in too, so it certainly wasn't just White. But yeah he wasn't good.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aiixc,t1_j7ae44p
"Big Gabby was good, Eddie was OK, Zinchenko honestly had lots of ball through being the floating extra man but he really didn't do too much with it.",Arsenal,Yes,j7afwyo,t1_j7ae44p

"Dropping only 7 points is very unlikely though. They won't get 96 points, of course.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ctir4,t1_j7c9y4b
Exactly. Thank you. Feel like I‚Äôm going insane with some of these replies lol,Arsenal,Yes,j7aimc2,t1_j7aikfy
"I‚Äôd have to watch the Newcastle ones back but just saying this one wasn‚Äôt. 

If Gabriel had control of the ball it‚Äôs different but this is little more than a 50:50 and you can‚Äôt give a penalty for that.",Arsenal,Yes,j7adsuf,t1_j7adne4
"Yep, teams randomly up their game all the time. They still have very high quality players. All you need is Salah to have a great game suddenly.",Arsenal,Yes,j7allg9,t1_j7alfji
Right? Two goals in 10 minutes. I wouldn‚Äôt even be shocked.,Arsenal,Yes,j7c37cb,t1_j7c34wy
"Sure I guess but if your answer is taking him out the lineup and putting another striker in, then I question that decision. Especially when he offers the best service to said strikers.",Arsenal,Yes,j7c94ic,t1_j7c86vo
"Ah, that‚Äôs unfortunate for him. Happy he‚Äôs not being left out for other reasons though. Hope he recovers soon.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cv81y,t1_j7cuiuz
"Agreed with everything asides them ‚Äòbeing miles behind City‚Äô

‚Ä¶they are literally 3 points/1 win behind City nowüòÖ",Arsenal,Yes,j7db9fa,t1_j7d8a7y
"That's reasonable to consider.

You're arguing that we made a change that preserved physicality (Xhaka) and simply swapped less physical players, bringing in a fresh one for a tired one who'd been slogging away. I'd say that's a potentially sound reading; that could well be what Arteta was trying to do.

That would prompt three questions:

1. Did that change help? i.e. was Vieira more effective than √òdegaard?

2. Was the physical player more effective than the less physical players in the same position (advanced 8), or was he even less effective?

3. How much did those opposing teams care about neutralising that physical player in attack, compared to neutralising those less physical players?",Arsenal,Yes,j7avr0d,t1_j7aujnt
"I don't have an easy answer there, and I don't know that there is one.

What I'm fairly confident about is that trying to outmuscle teams like these is not only a terrible plan, but one that precisely sacrifices our advantages for a weaker version of their strengths, on their terms.

If I had to make a general suggestion, it would be to intensify the way we attack, rather than abandoning it.

More involvement going forward from the fullbacks could help, but I don't think just sending them on the overlap to spam crosses will work. Playing a five-channel attack with one channel the opposing defence can simply ignore is not helping, but our options there are, due to injury and recency, not ideal.

I can say that I'm fairly confident Arteta does have ideas, and that we've already heard some of them.",Arsenal,Yes,j7atzqh,t1_j7ati0m
"They certainly didn't help, but that's too easy an answer.",Arsenal,Yes,j7at1ih,t1_j7asv3h
"Possibly.

I rate Eddie, and I think he's performed admirably, but that was a match where Jesus could have helped, even just as a change; he would have asked different questions of those set defences.

But I do think it's notable that despite all of the attempts to pin our lack of production on the left on Martinelli, Trossard didn't exactly set the world alight either. Everton contained him as well.

The problem, to my mind, is that it's too easy for those teams to stack up against 4 of our 5 attacking channels, and just flat out ignore the fifth.",Arsenal,Yes,j7asywe,t1_j7aso38
That's what Arteta said too. He implied we missed Jesus yesterday,Arsenal,Yes,j7atx5r,t1_j7aso38
Or Zina LB and Trossard at the 8. Or a fit ESR. Or Vieira.,Arsenal,Yes,j7b1u57,t1_j7b1805
"It's almost like we need someone else to be providing that width instead of Zinchenko and Martinelli, or offering real threat in the channel when Martinelli is wide.

If only we had another player on the left side of our attack...",Arsenal,Yes,j7b196z,t1_j7b123t
I think Tomi helps against these doubles because he sits where the double comes from.  He's basically an anchor that allows Ode to play around him.  Maybe it's because he's played as a FB longer and just feels more comfortable in those places.,Arsenal,Yes,j7b21zb,t1_j7b123t
if we won yesterday would the job have been done ?no. so what exactly is ur point?,Arsenal,Yes,j7bcppj,t1_j7bat17
"You can't compare Saka's position with Gabi's. Look at the amount of support Saka has. Xhaka does drift out, but definitely not as much as √òdegaard does. Idk.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cvwno,t1_j7cv1y9
"I think that was more overall fatigue, frustration and growing Everton confidence after the goal than Jorginho. Remember they were more than happy to take a draw here. Going 1-0 up at 60 min was a huge boost to their confidence in play style",Arsenal,Yes,j7ar6o4,t1_j7aqty1
"Well it didn't help that very shortly after we made those two subs, Everton scored. Don't think it was either Jorginho or Trossard's fault for the goal but it was very unfortunate timing",Arsenal,Yes,j7arorq,t1_j7aqty1
"Ehhh the performance was just so poor all round that I don‚Äôt think there was any real noticeable difference, and this is all putting aside whether potential painkillers etc for Partey were starting to wear off a bit too. 

It‚Äôs just easy for people to go after a scapegoat after literally our only 2nd League defeat of the season, and unfortunately it‚Äôs unsurprising given how many idiots are in our fanbase",Arsenal,Yes,j7ar8du,t1_j7aqty1
"We mostly sucked when Thomas was on the pitch too, I think we looked good in the second half until Everton's goal but the first half was terrible.",Arsenal,Yes,j7auum4,t1_j7aqty1
Well don't let me stop you from taking the midnight train going anywhere.,Arsenal,Yes,j7bg8yn,t1_j7bfjak
"Saka has been this season, no?",Arsenal,Yes,j7c4ix8,t1_j7c49lg
Rarely. No way you can book for this one tbh. But the one in the arsenal game was dead on simulation for a penalty. Should be added to VAR that. If you simulate to force a check in VAR and you obviously dive you should get booked by the ref on the pitch,Arsenal,Yes,j7c4kmr,t1_j7c49lg
"Yeah Joelinton just a day ago, but usually only for diving inside the box I feel. Most dives are in the box tho",Arsenal,Yes,j7c4nn9,t1_j7c49lg
"Yeah, Saka does",Arsenal,Yes,j7c4odk,t1_j7c49lg
"I've seen a lot of revisionism over 2015/2016 of late calling that team very good. 

We tried to replace Giroud with Benzema, Higuain, Suarez then signed Lacazette and Aubameyang. 

All of those players minus Lacazette were better than Giroud by a mile.",Arsenal,Yes,j7d2wb4,t1_j7d25qq
"No one's ever called Giroud one of the greatest strikers of his generation.

Not thinking he's an absolute donkey and getting weirdly angry anytime he gets success isn't thinking he's Henry.

"Yeah, I think that‚Äôs why Liverpool is so popular in in the US, too",Arsenal,Yes,j7c6zdn,t1_j7c4cxg
"Yeah I think they would be at the top with us and City as well, but because Serie A is weaker than Premier League they can concentrate on CL too. It's almost impossible trying to go for both PL and CL",Arsenal,Yes,j7coph4,t1_j7cnel7
Nah. Top four dog fight though.,Arsenal,Yes,j7cnwnh,t1_j7cnel7
"Brighton have a little better analytics than either team, but would likely have to win both matchups they have left.

Ben White was poor,Arsenal,Yes,j7alumq,t1_j7ajzk3
"If you mean Jesus, I get it. There is some truth to it.

But any first team winger for arsenal should not be reliant on other players to play well, period. That means we are accommodating him. Do you think saka should be playing well only when odegaarf is playing. Saka plays well regardless who plays with him. We need that kind of attacking players.

Besides martinelli used to do the same thing before too. It just got figured out by the defenders. 

In fact he was even more predictable before. There was a whole time when Gabi sat on the bench under Arteta. Because every time he got the ball he just out his head down and ran full speed with the ball. Under Arteta he learned to add slight variations in speed to keep the defenders guessing, you know stops, then runs again that sort of thing. and that's how he got back into the team. He needs to do that more. I rarely ever see him cut inside. It's just become way too easy to defend him, everyone just knows where he is going.

Compare him to Saka, Saka is completely unpredictable. He might go outside, cut inside, change his speed, run in behind, play one twos. It's a nightmare for defenders.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ay71q,t1_j7awtq5
Just like Tom Finney.,Arsenal,Yes,j7d0vmn,t1_j7d003o
Once I knew dyche was coming in I knew we wouldn‚Äôt win tbh of course everyone else got to face Lampard once except us.,Arsenal,Yes,j7acncf,t1_j7aclbq

Tbh they'd let him leave though. Why keep a who who doesn't want to be there for a season,Arsenal,Yes,j7ckb4m,t1_j7cju7l
"Agreed with that. But I still think the rest of the team would have to execute the game plan significantly better if we wanted to win that game, regardless of who we have up top.",Arsenal,Yes,j7b1209,t1_j7axdk6
An attacking midfielder? Wrong profile completely.,Arsenal,Yes,j7ahe1s,t1_j7aehtq

"no, don‚Äôt care for ligue 1 and half Italian so I will always watch the derby",Arsenal,Yes,j7cnjp1,t1_j7cmry7
"Looking back at the game, we had 3 major problems. Firstly, we were too slow in our build-up which meant we allowed Everton to get into their defensive shape in time and allowed them to setup their press in time. Secondly, we weren't brave enough with the ball, many times their haphazard frantic pressing left spaces wide open but we didn't exploit that and lastly, when we did break through their shape we were soft physically and poor with our touch.

All three factors combined give Everton enough security to see out the game without conceding more than one or two quality chances at best.",Arsenal,Yes,j7dfxsr,t1_j7dczs9
And? Whoever comes out of the two fixtures with the advantage will go on to win the title. Screencap it.,Arsenal,Yes,j7c69un,t1_j7c5wo2
We play the box to box CM as a 6 or play 4-2-3-1 rather than Jorginho who can't run to save his life.,Arsenal,Yes,j7arib2,t1_j7ardr7
"this is actually something i was paying attention to yesterday. there were lots of times where Martinelli was trying to position himself to make a run behind, but no one ever tried a long ball, not sure why...",Arsenal,Yes,j7ci36s,t1_j7chhtk
"Zinchenko should absolutely play every game, but he shouldn‚Äôt always be the LB. Tierney is way too good to rot on the bench.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ao122,t1_j7ankm3
"I disagree - when his inverted position works it‚Äôs beautiful, but when it doesn‚Äôt it‚Äôs really bad case in point that stupid Antony goal for United. Some
games we need to be compact and this need Tierney, other games we need fluidity and need Zinchenko. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with either in my opinion.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aojc7,t1_j7ankm3

"he is a better passer & better playmaker. that's literally just facts. xhaka offered nothing against this defense and vieira has all the tools to dismantle it. that is literally not up for debate, or you didn't watch vieira at porto.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aiaql,t1_j7ai28j
"It was mentioned in the other thread but those posting and pushing carefully curated comps of only Jorginho's positive involvements are being the same as those scapegoating him. If we let go of any agenda either way we can admit he didn't play particularly well when he came on, gave the ball away several times and didn't help us control the game.

That said, it was 30 minutes of football in one game, and we certainly didn't lose because of him. We'll see how he does for us after 5 matches. And even if he isn't any good, if Lokonga has a great loan that's one positive outcome from the transfer.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ai95q,t1_j7agjpi

I despise Ferguson for obvious reasons but what I will always respect is that ability ti create a win at all costs mentiality.

"I observe it all the time because personally I watch games for such tiny things. It's why I sometimes lose it when fans lump on players for the same things their favorites are guilty of. 

Partey is probably our most important player but his passing is average. For a single pivot, it's not okay. Martinelli in the United game in the first 13 minutes was missing passes so bad you'd think he wasn't a PL player. That's why the defence of, 'It's Jesus' absence..' doesn't hold for me. 

But to be fair, the results matter more. It's hard to play an immaculate game. Just that where this team is headed, you need to master the simple stuff.",Arsenal,Yes,j7av2hs,t1_j7arlb1

That's miles difference.",Arsenal,Yes,j7dkr3v,t1_j7db9fa
"I don't think the strategy is ever going to be to outmuscle them. They have three ballwinners and two defensive wingers flanking. 

Our strategy will always be to pass our way round. Ultimately, our passing was too slow and inaccurate, we failed to 'dominate' the game, as Arteta put it. But our players were also not showing for the ball because they were being physically run ragged by the press. 

It's not necessarily about building a team of tall brick houses but about maintaining a base level of strength and athleticism to not feel the brunt of these intense presses. It's about bravery too, but having press resistant players changes that required bravery into assured confidence.

We finished the game with Fabio, Jorginho, Xhaka, Trossard and Zinny on the pitch. All players I like, but in combination you are just left with a weak spine, particularly down the middle of the pitch. Several are agile and speedy in small spaces, or show great stamina over the length of the game, however, they all share some common weaknesses [from a purely athletic perspective].

Yes, everything can still work with good passing rhythm and active movement but when the other team is aggressively tracking and matching our stamina and intensity, you are faced with the ugly truth that we have a midfield that simply folds under too much physical pressure and doesn't quite have the speed nor explosiveness to escape such battles.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aw3bv,t1_j7atzqh

"Not comparing positions directly but more the overall movement and attacking threat from Saka hasn‚Äôt diminished since Jesus‚Äô absence. That‚Äôs my point.

"I'm certainly not saying it was Jorginho's fault we lost, and I would agree that's a pretty idiotic take.

"I don't *simply* mean Jesus, though Jesus' activity did hide a multitude of sins, especially on the left.

No, that would be silly. But √òdegaard creates both a lot of space and a lot of opportunities for Saka; they give each other a lot to work with in attack, and both present problems for opposing defences, both individually and in combination. Their interaction is also part of what allows White to get forward more than Zinchenko.

Now think about what Martinelli is working with on our left.

>  I rarely ever see him cut inside.

If Martinelli comes inside, which I would also like to see him do more, who's offering the width?

In theory, that's *part* of what *should* be happening: the LCM is supposed to alternate with the LW both in providing width and coming inside, as √òdegaard and Saka alternate on the right; the fullback can get involved in that dynamic as well, though their *primary* role is to tuck in next to the 6.

Now compare what's happening on our right to our left. Is one more dynamic, and the other more static? Is Xhaka good at providing width? Do opposing teams worry about him there? Do they worry about him coming inside when Martinelli is wide? Is Zinchenko getting forward to provide width, as you say, or is that happening a lot less than it should?

If you simply replace Martinelli with Trossard, and change nothing else (or nothing else changes circumstantially) you will simply get a different flavour of the same problem.",Arsenal,Yes,j7b4rbz,t1_j7b3ozy

"ben white has been better, but tomiyasu has been struggling with injury since the end of the last season and even went to the world cup with one. he's finally healed and played consistently and has given strong perfromances, so your comment is moot.

"What do you mean precedent. It‚Äôs always been allowed to shift your body weight around the ball to win a 50:50.

"I understand that but if you look at our squad we are in need of a ball winning mid. Hence why we were in for Caicedo. Onana's mobility and ball winning would be useful but also have doubts about his offensive output against low block...we do currently play Xhaka there though so I don't think it would be much worse.

Have actually seen Onana rotate to the wide wing and make half space runs each time he's played - he scored a goal on his debut in this manner if I remember correctly.

Biggest question mark would be passing imo and his movement/understanding of rotations within our positional system.",Arsenal,Yes,j7b9tvo,t1_j7b9a8a

"That's a bit disingenuous. Quoting betting odds forces you to pick a favourite right now. Whereas if you're given three options - Arsenal win, city win, too far away to tell - I imagine the most common pick would be too far away to tell.

"controversial opinions:

martinelli's game has been kinda hit and miss all season, but it's just been masked by the goals. not even having a dig, he's good overall and still has room to improve, but can often kinda not do much all game and then score all of a sudden, but yes of course there are some games where he's quite involved. tactics kinda hang him out to dry a bit though, he's often very isolated


also as tidy as zinny is, he's not doing anything too disimilar to what xhaka would do when he took up those positions, and like xhaka would do at times, he often takes a touch too many and needlessly slows us down. 


the first part of the take on zinny is more frustration with the set up though than with the man himself; I'm more than sure that any team sitting back against us would much rather see our wingback making safe passes as well as the odd line breaker into an akward central area of the pitch than bombing down the wide areas of the pitch and sending in several crosses as well as creating 2v1s or 2v2s (so many 2v1s for saka and martinelli today!) in the wide areas

More teams are gonna play like Everton and Newcastle now. And we need players who okay better against teams that sit back 

Xhaka has been exceptional. He fights for the team. But against teams who sit back, we need a more technical 8, who can also create chances like odegaard. Now it's easier to shut us down by marking odegaard out.

"I'm an Adelaide United fan (hence my flair), we've got a solid core of academy products in our first team but Irankunda is definitely the most promising of the lot. Hopefully he can stay fit and doesn't jump at the first overseas opportunity just to stagnate in a reserve squad like so many of Australia's best talents.",Arsenal,Yes,j767pyj,t1_j765y75

It's disgraceful that we've only worn our best kit (IMO) twice the entire season. I don't think it's eligible in the Europa League and we're out of both cups so the opportunities to wear it are even more limited,Arsenal,Yes,j75uny9,t1_j75u9oi
My day is ruined,Arsenal,Yes,j75uno8,t1_j75u9oi
What are the requirements to be allowed to wear it other than clashing colours? I checked and surely against Leicester away it should be possible no?,Arsenal,Yes,j75xtcs,t1_j75u9oi

Are you still friends with that person.,Arsenal,Yes,j75y73w,t1_j75wrex
They needed him in that midfield with Enzo. Mount and Gallagher ain‚Äôt it,Arsenal,Yes,j75v33c,t1_j75uxli
Jorginho is an excellent signing because now we have a decent Partey backup short term. If Partey is a 9/10 and Sambi is a 5/10 then Jorgingo is at least a 7/10 and that is a huge difference.,Arsenal,Yes,j763fch,t1_j75uxli
"It's telling that the new signings were Chelsea's best players. I don't know why Chelsea fans see that as a positive, give it a week and they will be brought down to Chelsea's level lol. The whole team is turgid",Arsenal,Yes,j75vr2j,t1_j75uxli

"I'm just always going to assume that City will be perfect. Remember 2019? Liverpool were 5 points clear with 14 games left. They only dropped 6 points, but still lost the title.",Arsenal,Yes,j768x2a,t1_j75u21c
"Agreed. His own antics with the Chelsea jersey announcement/ video where the whole family wore it at home; well he had no other option to endear himself to the Chelsea fanbase. 

Especially after his home burglary & jaw being broken. 

It must‚Äôve been so weird to process all that & with Barca throwing him aside to accommodate Lewa.

Again, he‚Äôs a grown man & an adult so his clowing was sad to see; but i can imagine he was just in a funky place mentally",Arsenal,Yes,j75wlxb,t1_j75u40w
"I don't. He was a pretty serviceable player, then became bad after we made him highest paid player in the club's history. We were just recovering from Ozil. We are not Chelsea that doesn't feel the pinch of wages. 

Then he goes to Barcelona and starts playing like he cares.",Arsenal,Yes,j75x23n,t1_j75u40w

"I love reading Pessi and Penaldo just because of how rattled their fanboys get at such a basic insult.

Even funnier when it's accompanied by a ridiculously stupid story like ""I was just about to sign the contract to save the local orphanage, only for Penaldo to barge in and steal the pen for himself, just so he could statpad even more. Shame on you Penaldo!""",Arsenal,Yes,j75y5f8,t1_j75ue2a

Rashford's current form will single handedly earn them a lot of points,Arsenal,Yes,j75ynps,t1_j75y0wb
Rashford tweaks his hammy or drops form and it's over for them to be honest. They'll be delighted with top four and a carabao cup if they win it.,Arsenal,Yes,j760qlc,t1_j75y0wb

"Yeah plenty here will get irrationally upset if Spurs don't take points off City, it's sad to see.

If we want to talk about winning the league then we need to first of all beat City in the Emirates",Arsenal,Yes,j77k05p,t1_j77i10k
I cannot believe i will be rooting for that lot. But i will be and it is gonna be a massive game. Not expecting anything though. They are complete dross throughout 45 minutes of every game.,Arsenal,Yes,j77lum3,t1_j77i10k
Selling Jesus was said in some comments tooüôÉüôÉ,Arsenal,Yes,j7883mc,t1_j782ppx
"We certainly do. The guy is immense everywhere on the pitch especially in build up play. Outstanding defensively as well. He just creates chance after chance and it is what we are severely missing recently, games like today and the Newcastle game are perfect examples. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love Eddie, but he‚Äôs just that typical box striker who is great at scoring goals and we can rely on him for that, but he doesn‚Äôt get involved all over the pitch like GJ does so we create less chances than we normally would. Anyways, he‚Äôs injured for now and there‚Äôs nothing we can do about it. The guy will be like a new signing when he comes back, ready to tear defences down again.",Arsenal,Yes,j784bom,t1_j782ppx
"Lol @back up winger. I say this without fear that Jesus would be our best winger if he accepted the role.  And yes, he'd still wreck the same havoc‚Äî even way more dangerous because he's way better 1v1, can deliver a cross and so many other technical advantages he has over the first XI wingers. 

It's no biggie really. We still keep his tools, while also having a striker that finishes his moves.",Arsenal,Yes,j78igtt,t1_j782ppx
"I hate Spurs because I'm an Arsenal fan.

I hate Man U because I'm a football fan.

I hate Chelsea because I'm human",Arsenal,Yes,j75vswn,t1_j75viho
"I find Chelsea dull and not interesting really. They are like City. At least City have an exciting brand of football and can give one a tactical lesson. Chelsea are soulless. Gather a bunch of stars, then hope for the best. I know almost no one serious to banter with when Chelsea lose. And even if they win, if you have billions pumped into the squad with squad turnovers every 2 years, you're supposed to win. I once lurked their sub and found a couple of them calling their board(s) unserious. Deluded. 

""We won a game!"" Well, the team you just played costs what your one player costs. 


I however hate United. Pure rage when something goes right for them.",Arsenal,Yes,j75w1a1,t1_j75viho
"He's presumably dumping Auba and Havertz for next summer's big striker signing, Ziyech was supposed to be gone but they fucked it and you feel Sterling might get moved on, while Felix is gone at the end of the season anyway.",Arsenal,Yes,j75y8kj,t1_j75y26i
"U forgot to mention players out on loan, ex Lukaku is ‚Ç¨100m sitting on their book.",Arsenal,Yes,j75zn9q,t1_j75y26i
You wait for them to injure eachother in training and play the surviving ones.,Arsenal,Yes,j75z9uh,t1_j75y26i
"That's not even counting the fact that they have Lukaku and CHO out on loan, bought Omari Hutchinson in the summer with the promise of a path to the first team (lmao) and Nkunku is joining in the summer too. Apparently they want to make Felix permanent too. 15 players.",Arsenal,Yes,j760dr8,t1_j75y26i
"And still no good 9.

It's actually laughable how poor the squad planning there is.",Arsenal,Yes,j760n76,t1_j75y26i
Why does Mudryk have goals in him?,Arsenal,Yes,j75y7ij,t1_j75y26i
"Auba, Havertz, Pulisic, Ziyech are obviously not in the plans. Probably Broja too but he's gonna be out for a while so they can't sell. Then Felix is only a loan and he'll be back to Atletico next season. Mount is playing midfield he's not exactly fighting for the forward spots.",Arsenal,Yes,j75yx9a,t1_j75y26i
Its gonna be a toxic dressing room this season for sure. The plan is probably to have a 'survival of the fittest' half season and then offload those that dont survive in the summer.,Arsenal,Yes,j75zdn4,t1_j75y26i
">thinking

He isn't.",Arsenal,Yes,j75zmvg,t1_j75y26i
"They just need 6 so I believe 5 will leave or be counted as midfielders. Like Mount. 

So Auba, Pulisic, Ziyech and Broja might leave. They'll buy a box striker.",Arsenal,Yes,j7638ep,t1_j75y26i
"He'll offload the ones he doesn't want, either loans for the young ones or sales for the old ones. And he'll probably try to buy more. 

He just needs 4 or 5 to hit and he'll be sorted and can just write off the rest or even sell for profit. 

No Europe will add more pressure on the squad and financially on the club so it's something we should be hoping for but they could fail to qualify and still be totally fine too.",Arsenal,Yes,j75yirs,t1_j75y26i
"Nah. We shall still recruit 2 good names. I'm not that worried about them. Strong team, but we can still beat them.",Arsenal,Yes,j766r8r,t1_j764gqy
"I'm amused at all the circle jerk around 
 Chelsea being shit comments, because apart from 1 or 2 players, their first team looks mad talented. And their squad already looks stacked as fuck.

"Agreed. Everton had a number of solid chances they could have converted and in that regard we were actually rather lucky defensively, while we didn‚Äôt create enough offensively in order to outweigh that. Actually think we looked much more solid against Newcastle, who are undoubtedly a better team than Everton",Arsenal,Yes,j77abds,t1_j76sif8
He doesn't need a wingback; he just needs an √òdegaard. The lack of support he gets from midfield is shocking.,Arsenal,Yes,j76wth8,t1_j76skcy
Your last statement. Mastering what ability? Beating your man one on one consistently? Long -range shooting?,Arsenal,Yes,j76vjti,t1_j76skcy
"I don't think so.

I have been laboring to explain Martinelli problems but people think critiquing an in-form player is sacrilege. Martinelli was subbed off for the exact reason I've been trying to explain. He's weak when he has to beat a man 1v1. Low blocks are his worst nightmare. He might sneak a ball in or two but that's his weakness. 

It's not a tactical thing. It's technical from his side. That's why his future is at ST. Zinchenko was inverted at City but his wingers flourished. The last 3-4 games weren't a surprise. Once you cut off the ""dash past my man"" play, you have eliminated 80% of the Martinelli threat.",Arsenal,Yes,j76y5b0,t1_j76skcy
"We need to put the theory that martinelli works better with wingback to bed. He has already played with Tierney alot and all it did was get in each others way. 

Besides we can't keep hiding martinelli all the time. He can't even take a player on. He needs some time on the bench to work on himself. 

Also the same thing was repeated all the time for pepe too. Can't believe we're going through this again.",Arsenal,Yes,j76zz1f,t1_j76skcy
"Hang in there dude, I just got into contact with a professional for the first time. It'll be a journey but we'll get through it, just like this season it'll have ups and downs.",Arsenal,Yes,j76w9uv,t1_j76unt1

">Everton have the perfect set up to play Dyche ball, don't know why they didn't get him earlier. 

Everton have delusions of grandueur and believe they should be playing more expansive football which is why they ran Big Sam Allardyce out of that shithole. Dyche will save them, then they will eventually turn on him. It's a tale as old as time with those bluenose cunts.",Arsenal,Yes,j76vmmu,t1_j76uo6l

"It's an Unai Emery team.  We let them score two quick ones, then let them take their foot off the gas like they always do and score five thereafter.",Arsenal,Yes,j773blt,t1_j7710zt
"HAHA I thought the same earlier, was like fuck it... forgot to put on the jersey. I'll take some of the blame with you.",Arsenal,Yes,j774xqp,t1_j772rgt
I bought a scarf at the armory earlier this season and we haven‚Äôt lost in since I‚Äôve been wearing it. I was too lazy to find it this morning. My bad fam.,Arsenal,Yes,j777pag,t1_j772rgt
"I wore my new shirt for the first time instead of my old one, been lowkey afraid it‚Äôs all my fault. Glad to know it was you instead, cheers",Arsenal,Yes,j778mnj,t1_j772rgt
"You kind of expected that back then, you knew that when the pressure was on that we didn't have the squad to maintain a title challenge. There was also a fragility to our game, we didn't have a planB.

I don't feel that with this team. I expect us to get a win against Brentford and get a result (draw, win) against City too. We'll see 

If it was back then with Wenger, we would lose against Brentford and get thumped by City",Arsenal,Yes,j77toa2,t1_j77qyra
"Lol I told people here as early as September. 

It's like PTSD-lite. Every time we have something good going, February is the month it all starts going wrong. If something catastrophic happens vs Brentford, I'll be a coward. I can't take more patterns.",Arsenal,Yes,j78iz41,t1_j77qyra
C'mon man could talk about grass looked dry but we should overcome those stuff,Arsenal,Yes,j78b1o4,t1_j78ao0t
"Yeah there's a definite sense of entitlement from some posts, as if we should be winning every game.

Any team would have struggled there today, they were up for it and got their tactics spot on.

We got beaten and we move on. Now if we drop points to Brentford at home, I'll be pissed off!",Arsenal,Yes,j78cgb5,t1_j78ao0t
"We are in a title race, only City's results matter.",Arsenal,Yes,j7820y9,t1_j77wxxa

"Yeah, its weird to blame a holding midfielder for our lack of goal production.

"It's still empty hatred for me... hard to explain, but, I hate Tottenham with such ferocity that it means something when we play each other, and I would never give that up. 

Chelsea I just hate because they are the antithesis of what I think a football club should be and they have achieved everything in the most scummy, bullshit, transfers-on-steroids way. Even when they were 'brilliant' under Mourinho the first time round they were winning with the most disgusting version of football. They don't have enough of an identity now to build meaningful hatred because they've changed managers / players so frequently that I don't even know what they are anymore.",Arsenal,Yes,j765or4,t1_j764po5
"Chelsea absolutely. Even growing up in London I‚Äôve hated Chelsea more than I‚Äôve hated Spurs. If Spurs got relegated for example, it‚Äôd be hilarious at first but then it would actually just be somewhat disappointing. The rivalry we have with Spurs is a lot of fun, and it would make the league just a bit more boring if they weren‚Äôt in it. Chelsea on the other hand? Could not give a flying fuck. I‚Äôd actually completely love it if the fucking cesspool of a business institution (it‚Äôs not a football club in my eyes) went into administration. There is everything wrong with Chelsea. There isn‚Äôt with Spurs apart from the fact that they are well, Spurs üòÇ",Arsenal,Yes,j7666e4,t1_j764po5
Always felt spurs was irrelevant so my hate was wasted on them. Way easier to hate Chelsea and United for turning football into Wallstreet.,Arsenal,Yes,j765co2,t1_j764po5
"I hate Chelsea more than Spurs now. At least Spurs was never a major threat to us historically and currently. And they didn't ruin the transfer market permanently.

The only time Spurs were a major threat to us was during our banter years (2017-2021) and it was for the CL spot, not any major trophy.",Arsenal,Yes,j7655ak,t1_j764po5
"I don‚Äôt hate spurs, they are a great rival to have but they are a good club, don‚Äôt have a sugar daddy, owned pretty well and their fans on the whole are decent at away days. I actually pity them more than anything else. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love beating them and and highly enjoy watching them lose and be shit, but I don‚Äôt ‚Äòhate them‚Äô. Maybe in part growing up in north London and having a lot of friends who are spurs fans. Don‚Äôt know any proper chelsea dans lol. 

Chelsea are just scum, fans are disgusting animals and they have financially doped their way to success through a really despicable owner. No competition for me who is worse. United are kind of half way in between the two.

"Spurs are meant to be largely irrelevant to us, sometimes a minor annoyance. Young fans don't seem to understand that because of the last 6 years or so.

Chelsea are actually rivals and took our spot as top contenders in the league and as biggest london club in early 2000s using nothing but money. They have disgusting fans, amoral ex players, no history to speak of, operate from the worst borough in london and represent the absolute worst in english football.

Putting chelsea a long way in our rear view mirror should be a long term goal of this club, spurs being average and being behind us will be an added bonus of that.

For all I hate spurs, I don't really have much bad to say about their club other than it's useless, it's too close to ours and they hate us. I wouldn't really want to see spurs go out of business or something.

"Failed talents are such a common thing in football too, will be interesting to see what an 8.5 year security does to a player's motivation to improve on limited game time.

Another thing, I have to imagine the talent pool in baseball is much smaller than football? If his talent hoarding had the effect of weakening rivals in baseball, that effect will be basically zero in football unless he signs another 35 players.",Arsenal,Yes,j75ylp3,t1_j75xp2r

"Baseball is also the same in a sense. Not just about one player or even two. Look at the Angels with Mike Trout and Ohtani. Two best players in the league and not even above .500. Dodgers are unique because they can spend a ton of money when they need to, but also they have the best development in the MLB. So Boehly is flexing his muscles becuz I assume he isn‚Äôt used to losing (as Dodgers are consistently a top team). He wants this rebuild to be quick and not last multiple years.

"Absolutely needed to be faster with the ball and in passing it. We weren't nearly aggressive enough at the start which gave them confidence.

"I mean sure it looks like that, but Boehly put him into a shit position. Got no input on transfers, just a bunch of random good players and was told to make it work mid season. Also the prices were so absurd making the pressure very high instantly. Pep would struggle massively if he got delt such a hand and I don‚Äôt think he would have found success. I feel a bit sorry because he seems a good manager to me, but he knew what he was getting into when he went to that shitshow.",Arsenal,Yes,j75xyrf,t1_j75xgr9
I think there might be more of a problem with the management and owner in general than specifically with Potter.,Arsenal,Yes,j75y3va,t1_j75xgr9
"It's a weird one. I think everyone acknowledges how good of a job he has done at his previous clubs, and he had Brighton playing great football, but the football is dire and he doesn't exude that weird footballmanic vibe you get from Pep, Klopp, Conte, Arteta and maybe even Ten Hag.

I'd be vary of writing him off already, but I'm surprised how poorly they are doing.

I think there's also the Arteta-effect, where people say ""look what giving your manager time does"". But 

a) Arteta is a fucking genius

b) The wheels only truly came off between early November and Christmas in 2020. Take out those 7 games and you'll see a team improving steadily over three years. 

It's conflated in people's minds because of how low in the table we were when he took the reigns, how low our poor run put us for the remainder of 2020/21 and how much we suffered early and late last season, due to our lack of depth.",Arsenal,Yes,j75z62w,t1_j75xgr9
"I wonder how much of Brighton's success is down to Potter alone or the club hierarchy.

Seeing them performing with De Zerbi makes it clear that they have a great hierarchy in place.

I don't think that Potter is a bad manager per se, and I think that he was handed a poisoned chalice. A club in flux after a change of ownership and hierarchy, a new owner eager to throw his weight around and cement himself in the league, and a patchwork team with aging players and random signings that were never integrated properly due to their revolving door of managers.

I think that it's unfair to pin it all on Potter; any manager would struggle under such circumstances.

Recall the beginning of Arteta's tenure, and how long it took Edu and him to bring us to where we are now.

The only question is: is Chelsea/Boehly going to give Potter time to actually turn things around and build something or will the cycle of short-termism continue?",Arsenal,Yes,j75zytz,t1_j75xgr9

It's not that we'll move away from him, but that he'll likely move away from us. I'm sure Arteta would be happy to keep him as a squad player, even on fairly high wages.",Arsenal,Yes,j78oh0c,t1_j78dlis
He may have been muted today but I w wouldn't call him our weakest link. Most players struggled today. While I do see Edu bringing in competition for him I believe he'll stay until the end of his contract,Arsenal,Yes,j78jcaj,t1_j78dlis
"Needs to happen eventually, but in a gradual way, he's too important to the team as a leader on and off the pitch for us to just sell him IMO. Whoever we buy or promote up to play in his position will probably share minutes with him at first.",Arsenal,Yes,j78mv44,t1_j78dlis

Something happening to partey could derail that but otherwise he's 100% the only starting 11 position due an upgrade. 

We're sounding out targets already in the likes of rice and we know from the mudryk deal there is money to spend. 

And a ~100m midfield isn't about to play from the bench behind xhaka or wait for partey to pull a muscle. 

We know the cash is there and we know we are looking at midfielders. It's just a case of can we get the one we want.

I can't say what xhaka will do when that happens. The club wants to keep him but I would predict it's not a done deal as hell want to keep playing 40 games a season until he's 35.",Arsenal,Yes,j797fph,t1_j78dlis

"> We must be the only team we‚Äôre one poor result is considered a ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù.

History has shown that this isn't completely inaccurate. Ever since we stopped being title challengers we've typically played well most of the time but then fall apart when some odd result hasn't gone our way. There's a reason that Arsenal have become known as a team that folds around February -this used to be the time when we'd be in the CL and just get battered in the R16 and start to lose league games",Arsenal,Yes,j78sa5k,t1_j78qlh2
"True on Xhaka. 

The entire left side has been like this for a while since Jesus left. Zinchenko being our best player is testament of his ability but also a statement on how much he carries everyone on the left.",Arsenal,Yes,j77dudk,t1_j778f2t

"Mudryk has those games where he struggles to get into games. Happened when he played for Shakhtar and Ukraine.

Madueke was much better than him.",Arsenal,Yes,j75vjpm,t1_j75v8hu
"The problem is that when you're a hundred million player with allegedly a guaranteed starter clause and according to some on here a generational talent then you're supposed to drag teams up to your level.

Let's be honest Kane, Auba, Van Persie on their own have carried otherwise quite disjointed teams, Mudryk for what Chelsea have signed up for should be at least one of their better players and he's not.

In gazumping us they've taken a project player and Sancho'd him.",Arsenal,Yes,j75w4gt,t1_j75v8hu
"Trossard definitely coz he is in good form, knows the leagues and has adapted to life in uk

Mudryk is yet to adapt to league, country, and played less than Trossard this season",Arsenal,Yes,j75ynu0,t1_j75yjdo
"Trossard is a 10/10 signing imo, gives us a better shot at the title than Mudryk would have done imo. Mudryk has a way higher ceiling but hes not there yet.

Jorginho will be very good in possession, but ngl I'm worried about him out of possession. Partey does so much defensively and I really cant see Jorginho doing what Partey does. So would have much prefered Caicedo.",Arsenal,Yes,j7608dn,t1_j75yjdo
"Trossard definitely better than Mudryk for immediate impact. Jorginho similar to Caicedo, maybe slightly ahead because he has the experience that might help the rest of the team out.",Arsenal,Yes,j75ypl3,t1_j75yjdo
"If we are only considering the next 6 months Trossard and Jorginho are probably the better options. No adaptation, lots of PL experience in the exact positions we need etc. 

Mudryk and Caicedo would obvs win out in the long term but we need to go all in to win the PL now, who knows when we will have this chance again. Hopefully we build a team that can consistently challenge but you never when the like of City, Chelsea, Man U and Liverpool might actually sort their shit out.",Arsenal,Yes,j760adn,t1_j75yjdo
"Too early but...

Mudryk was a big miss. We could have heavily rotated Martinelli and Mudryk without losing anything. One would do CL, another PL. Or 70 mins of one, and 20 of the other, interchanging. That kind for 3 years minimum. In fact, one would finally transition into a striker. 

Trossard is great technically. I'd say he has better raw abilities in tiny spaces and 1V1 than Martinelli. He however doesn't have his energy and explosiveness. You need those traits wide these days. Trossard can't mount a charge over 90 minutes. He's at most a 40 minutes players wide‚Äî a sub/depth. 

So, basically Martinelli win keep developing as he's now guaranteed more minutes than he would have with Mudryk. And Trossard will be able to wreck havoc in his cameos that will let Martinelli rest.  It's good business. 


As for Caicedo. I wasn't so bothered. Jorginho lacks the urgency we need now as the entire team is like a swarm of bees, but Caicedo for me lacks that technical edge. It's not to say he's bad at it. He's just not Jorginho. 

I hope we go back for him in the summer as a long term '8'. Not as a six. He has a future as a Kante clone, just not as a plain 6.",Arsenal,Yes,j7631mc,t1_j75yjdo
"We're already building for the future, and we need immediate impact players to see out the rest of the season.

This winter window was always going to have inflated prices; all mid-season windows do, but this one proceeds a World Cup.

It would be better to reinforce long-term during the summer, and get reliable talent that can perform now.

It's not sour grapes due to missing out on reported targets. Mudryk would have needed time (as evidenced by his performance last night) and Caicedo, though PL proven, is still developing and would have have to adapt to a new team.

I think the right decisions were made, regardless of the circumstances of how they came to be.",Arsenal,Yes,j760ope,t1_j75yjdo
I think martienlli has slowed down too since Jesus hasn‚Äôt been in the team. I feel like Jesus just makes this team tik so nicely. I like Eddie but I‚Äôm not gonna lie I‚Äôm really excited to see Jesus play again.,Arsenal,Yes,j779vfm,t1_j779clb
"That's what teams have been doing to City for years now and they've had to find other ways to play too.

"Everton essentially copied Newcastle, just with much a shittier squad and a lot less preparation.

> How do we counter having saka and martinelli being double teamed and having our entire midfield swamped

Don't forget the same level of attention to √òdegaard.

The answer is simple: replace or demand more from the position left wide open by all this marking, and whose lack of involvement leaves Martinelli marooned, and limits Zinchenko's ability to get forward even more than White's.",Arsenal,Yes,j77zhqo,t1_j77linb
"Tripling at times. Combine that with an off day for your striker & the whole midfield, and we end up with a performance like today's.

Great on them for figuring us out and sticking to thier plans for 90min.",Arsenal,Yes,j77npq4,t1_j77linb
This is where you need a more direct and aggressive central mid which Ode is not. I've said this before that he can take some things from James Maddison who will take his own initiative in midfield and go after the opposition whereas the tendency to play the passing game is far too ingrained into Ode's game,Arsenal,Yes,j77o9ba,t1_j77linb

It's just unrealistic to say Potter should get results now, either way their season's dead. He should be looking at stuff like fundamentals and culture building, and using the dead season to experiment with his 40 players to decide who to keep/chuck, as well as what's his best setup

"4. Tuchel. Unbeaten in 10 games. Win 7 draw 3. We have be naive if we ignore that its a big thing that we always seem to crumble. There is duncan ferguson'a everton, carrick's united off the top of my head.",Arsenal,Yes,j7a2bjj,t1_j7a03wn
"Ole had the ultimate new manager bounce, he looked like the second coming of Sir Alex Ferguson",Arsenal,Yes,j7a21af,t1_j7a03wn
"New manager bounce is a myth. I‚Äôm sure there are way more than three examples of new managers not doing well too. You can‚Äôt present the proof as the instances of something happening without acknowledging the times it doesn‚Äôt. 

Also, just to provide some context to those examples:

1) Our unbeaten run under Emery was built on quite a bit of fortune and getting results from games where we didn‚Äôt play well or it was decided on very fine margins. 

2) Rangnick started managing United when they had an easy set of fixtures. Not to mention it‚Äôs actually incorrect because United lost to Wolves in their fifth league game under him. 

3) Three games is an extremely small sample that shouldn‚Äôt even be worth considering. Two of those games were them grinding out 1-0 wins against midtable teams as well. Losing the following three games while conceding 3 goals in each of them comfortably cancels out any positive sentiments too.",Arsenal,Yes,j7a2k83,t1_j7a03wn
Think it was just to preserve Partey. He‚Äôs not at 100% and Arteta hoped Jorginho would be enough,Arsenal,Yes,j76ruzd,t1_j76rm99
"It's hard but I see the logic.

Against a low block, you need more of a better passer of the ball. You need more a pass than trying to go through the press. Those two are kind of better at the one route football. Odegaard draws attention to himself, Partey despite everything is a relatively poor passer for a pivot. 

It just didn't work but you get the logic. 

Also, I hope people stop this 'make subs!!' whenever a game isn't going well. Such games end in wallowing in self-pity but should also be lessons. The manager starts the best players and unless the first XI player is returning from injury, usually bench players are second best.",Arsenal,Yes,j76z12n,t1_j76rm99
Honestly one of the saddest thing about Mo‚Äôs injury is that we won‚Äôt hear his awesome chant to twist and shout this season üò¢,Arsenal,Yes,j75xmg9,t1_j75xbda

You're able to hope someone succeeds, while wanting us to be better.",Arsenal,Yes,j76762u,t1_j761bsu
"Martinelli's problems should be obvious by now. Even if one can't see them, you could watch any Martinelli clip, then 5 other clips of top wingers and notice what he needs to do better. It's so simple. If you insist that you don't know better wingers, just watch the ones we have been linked to. You'll get a more informed opinion.

I don't like Trossard wide but I prefer he starts against low blocks either wide, or in that Xhaka role.  Sub in Martinelli if we unlocked the low block and they are now desperate to attack. Martinelli is almost world class at counterattacks and is very good defensively.",Arsenal,Yes,j771aea,t1_j76xzfx
[deleted],Arsenal,Yes,j76zchd,t1_j76xzfx

"He'd be great in Xhaka's role imo. He is creative, can drop deeper into midfield, and is also comfortable out on the wing. He'd profile similarly to what Xhaka describes as a ""fake 10"" lol

"I might get slated for this, but I think he‚Äôs a good player with a lot to his game. Yes, he‚Äôs currently underperforming, but put him in a decent team and watch him transform into a beast. He‚Äôs not a technical wizard or genius maestro, but he‚Äôs one of those players that can do a bit of everything.

I feel he‚Äôs currently experiencing a similar slump to the ‚Äòold‚Äô Rashford. It won‚Äôt surprise me if he regains his form soon. You don‚Äôt win player of the year twice at a club like Chelsea if you‚Äôre a shit player.

It‚Äôs very unlikely Chelsea will sell him to us, especially if Jorginho turns out to be great transfer.",Arsenal,Yes,j75vj4l,t1_j75unvf
"'With Kante' is the most important thing there.

He made Danny Drinkwater look good enough for Chelsea to  spend Salah money on.",Arsenal,Yes,j75wd8d,t1_j75unvf
We shouldn't be buying players based on a past purple patch.,Arsenal,Yes,j75vspw,t1_j75unvf
"I love players like Mount. My only problem with them is that they normally become pretty useless when they lose their extra lung. 

Trossard isn't explosive but he will at least carry a bit of technical ability into his later years.",Arsenal,Yes,j75wmqt,t1_j75unvf

He was really poor today. It seems like the work he did to improve his agility and quickness has worn off with the rigor of the season.,Arsenal,Yes,j77ey5n,t1_j77cplo
"The thing is this is easy to say in hindsight. If we would have lost the FA Cup and also lost one of the main players to injury in that game and then lost today to Everton, we'd be pointing to the FA Cup saying ""Why did we start player X in the FA Cup when he is so crucial for the title race ?""",Arsenal,Yes,j77jat7,t1_j77ig6q
Starting 11 doesn‚Äôt guarantee we would have won either.,Arsenal,Yes,j77jfru,t1_j77ig6q

Where do these comments come from?,Arsenal,Yes,j797z4c,t1_j78y3l5
"But you understand the problem you are describing isn't solely to do with Tierney.

Whoever we have on the bench we will question if they could have changed things, it's in the nature of football fans. 

Only way you'll be happy is if we have a squad of 11 players or we win all our games?",Arsenal,Yes,j79628f,t1_j78y3l5
">he becomes the answer

Maybe if you aren't fully reading what people are saying.

They are seeing our games and observing which sort of play style might help us get out of a rut. Today we didn't have enough support on the wings and didn't overlap much which is a different plan that Tierney would help with.",Arsenal,Yes,j79vcgf,t1_j78y3l5
"Ah this take.

Maybe Jonathan David? Chupa Akpom? Aubameyang?",Arsenal,Yes,j76wz3o,t1_j76sw41

"I completely disagree. Eddie is most useful against the big teams who will try and play their game against us, where we can get Eddie the ball in the penalty box with consistency. Against teams who sit back and park the bus, we need Jesus, whose abilities are better suited to breaking down that defense. We just need Jesus healthy",Arsenal,Yes,j77a05u,t1_j76sw41
Never want City to get the one thing they've not been able to buy yet,Arsenal,Yes,j75y9mg,t1_j75xuya

The right answer is Madrid,Arsenal,Yes,j75xzer,t1_j75xuya
"No thanks... If you're an Arsenal fan you don't want another Premier league club winning their first one before us. Its bad enough Chelsea have 2 now. Plus, Madrid have always been good to us.",Arsenal,Yes,j75y0d0,t1_j75xuya
"Real madrid easily, fuck city all day long. I hate their ""ooo but we play such beatiful football you have to like us"" bullshit. You'll be hard pressed to find a longtime football fan that puts up with their sportswashing",Arsenal,Yes,j75zpko,t1_j75xuya
"Hope City win nothing this year to be honest. Hope they get to the final in the FA cup and UCL and lose both, and we win the league.",Arsenal,Yes,j760tr5,t1_j75xuya
"‚ÄòDeserve‚Äô is a strange word. They‚Äôve bought their success and have one of the best squads and arguably the best manager in the world yet they‚Äôve failed season after season in Europe.     

Madrid on the other hand deserve all the success they‚Äôve gotten because Liverpool and City have been in the top 3 best teams in the world over the last five years yet Madrid have consistently stayed winning, even with major changes to their management, front line and back line and even when they‚Äôve fallen behind in major games.",Arsenal,Yes,j75zgrf,t1_j75xuya
"Madrid. 

However I‚Äôd take city this year if they decide to effectively bin this season in the league for us to win so they can win champs league üòú

"City.

I'm not a fan of clubs hogging trophies. City should lose out on PL, but not CL. Besides, it doesn't even pinch that hard. They have emptied an entire oil field into the squad. No passion there.

"""rarely"" lol",Arsenal,Yes,j78dcvz,t1_j78cp8i
"Denial of legit Martinelli criticism is kind of weird. People aren't even saying he's shit and he should leave. 

He's not a good dribbler but as a 21 year old, he can work on it. 

People go so deep into their denial that they tell themselves that the club targeting Raphinha and trying to spend ‚Ç¨95M on Mudryk to come and be his depth. 

Maybe with Jesus, he will get a chance to occupy more central areas. The wing thing just keeps exposing him.",Arsenal,Yes,j78fzli,t1_j78cp8i
"Strongly disagree, and if you are saying this due to today's result, I think it was more a lack of tactical adaptation which led to a build up in pressure and thus resulting in a loss in focus and composure",Arsenal,Yes,j77d9ix,t1_j77al0n
">but we clearly didn't do the business this window to win the league, owners are asking us for patience which is fair, they own the club and they dont care about the title

Nonsence. We were willing to drop 75mil on Mudryk and got out done by a mega bid from Chelsea and then we also willing to splash 75m on Caicedo and Brighton flat our refused. We also wanted Zubimendi who wasn't available. Stop throwing toys out the pram over one loss",Arsenal,Yes,j77bmmk,t1_j77al0n
"Bad take.

We have been trying to be title contenders for the last 3 windows. Martinez, Vlahovic, Raphinha, Locatelli, Kounde‚Äî name it. We have done enough. We just aren't an A+ team with funds. 

A lot of people see this transfer business as emotional. That you just tell a player about a project and its done. The Mudryk transfer should have told everyone what was up. You could have project appeal, the cash and even a player agent on your side and still lose to a bag of cash. 

Jorginho over Elneny is an upgrade.

Trossard over ESR is.

Kiwior over literally nobody is an upgrade too. 

Yet we were title contenders with those players. 

Arsenal spent fine given the circumstances. There was just always a bigger fish. 

And today's game wasn't on effort in the market. It was on the very individuals that have us 5 points ahead.",Arsenal,Yes,j77d7ry,t1_j77al0n

"That midfield block was working like a charm for them. Could never get much space around the box. Trossard might have been the better option to start, overall I just think we were isolated to less promising parts of the pitch. Dyche plays 'boring' football but when it works it's due to whatever system is against him not having alternatives. We needed to be much more direct and visionary with our passing, and we only play like that when we have more space in the midfield. I was really disappointed with our ability on set pieces offensively and defensively. Was the only way I could see us winning and we just didn't have it today.",Arsenal,Yes,j76s84n,t1_j76rgsq

13 goals in their last 8 PL games is not something to look down upon as well,Arsenal,Yes,j75vvag,t1_j75vqmm
"Their defence is really good and well organised and Guimaraes does a good job of shielding their backline, but some of them are not the fastest and they don't play with a high line. If they want to be more attacking they need to push up which will expose them more at the back. Teams have started sitting deeper against them now which is why they're starting to see more draws. They're tied for most draws in the league with Brentford (9/20 games) giving them only a 50% win rate. They'll need to push up eventually but they'll be exposed on the counter with all of these teams sitting back.

Also they've invested more in their attack than we have lol. Amiron, ASM, Gordon, Isak and Wilson cost ‚Ç¨180m. We've only spent ‚Ç¨85m on our attack (Jesus, Saka, Martinelli, Trossard, Nketiah, Nelson & ESR).",Arsenal,Yes,j75yxod,t1_j75wact
"Little different, Diaby we still had hope he could come good, same with RvP and his injuries. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

For Arteta, he was 33 and when he got his 1 year contract extension. We could have forced an early retirement to save money, he had no transfer value and I'm sure a player of his age coming back from such a serious injury would not elicit any offers. It might sound crazy but just back in 2014, the idea of players playing beyond 33 was extremely rare. In the very next season, Arteta played 9 PL games, and only once for more than 35mins. I'm certain it was a contract extension not based on football or financial reasons.",Arsenal,Yes,j765zr3,t1_j765elv

"They probably will go for a striker but honestly their form is not going to dictate that, they will do it regardless of where they finish.  

But our best hope with Chelsea is they finish outside of European places or in Europa conference spot. 

This will make it harder to attract top players, sow discontent amongst their massive squad, force loans and transfers they may not want to make and make it harder to balance the books. 

The more desperate they get the more likely they are to make desperate moves and overstretch themselves or even come a cropper of ffp.

But if he won't give back my money and stay a part of this MLM, then we'll go our separate ways",Arsenal,Yes,j75zpwk,t1_j75y73w
"I still think Chelsea will do a 4231 pretty soon , and Jorgi isn't a guarantee starter when Kante/Kovacic/Zakaria is back from injuries. All three is quite solid as double pivot.",Arsenal,Yes,j75vni3,t1_j75v33c
Yeah. They focused too much on the new signings and didn't care about the players already in their squad.,Arsenal,Yes,j75v89p,t1_j75v33c
"What about Gourcuff, Chris Samba and M'Vila,",Arsenal,Yes,j763wsl,t1_j763isv

"Agree, we will hopefully build a big lead through March. Our final 3 games are quite kind to us (Brighton (h), forest (a), wolves (h)) but just before then in april is quite tough with games away to pool, city, Newcastle and the home Chelsea game.

Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they try to buy Felix but I can‚Äôt imagine that working out.,Arsenal,Yes,j75z4fc,t1_j75yx9a
Yeah so they actually have to sell these lads or pay them off if you haven't noticed. Otherwise they stay there. It's not as easy as you make it sound. These lads are on huge wages and can't get into an injury ridden squad in 10th. Teams won't be throwing money around for them.,Arsenal,Yes,j760jmm,t1_j75yx9a
"Potter clearly has no say in signings.  He also doesn‚Äôt seem to have autonomy over the first 11 starts.  A coach doesn‚Äôt start a player 3 days after signing him, giving the player basically zero match prep or wider understanding of how the coach wants him to play.
He also wouldn‚Äôt start a clearly very unfit Mudryk over other players.
Potters time at Brighton has shown he isn‚Äôt an idiot, so those decisions are just bizarre.
Will the next coach get more autonomy? I doubt it.  Potter only joined 4 months ago, so I doubt the management is going to change their style overnight for a new coach.",Arsenal,Yes,j768jdz,t1_j766wyz
"One vs. one Martinelli is incredible, the problem we see in games like this is he is forced out to touch against more than one, which is an extremely tough thing for a winger to beat. You have to be near on perfect with the ball at your feet to consistently beat teams that double or triple up on you.

Having an overlap provides extra width support which typically takes a defender away leaving more one vs one opportunities.",Arsenal,Yes,j76vuha,t1_j76vjti

"As an older fan that's simply untrue, Spurs were better than us until Dein bought in (and overtook us again when he fucked up).

"It mainly is management and owner but at the same time the Chelsea management job requires very strong dogged personalities (Mourinho, ancelotti, conte, tuchel) if they want a chance of succeeding. Ditto for United. They‚Äôre the two toughest top 6 management jobs imo.

"Disagree (I‚Äôm not basing this on just today). Partey is WC, and Ode is well on his way there (a top CM this season already). There‚Äôs no other upgrade needed out of our starting 11 apart from MAYBE Ramsdale, but hes young and growing into being a great GK.

Imagine having a Jude/Camavinga/SMS/Mount (even with his rough patch right now).

Dream scenario for me a few weeks ago would‚Äôve been to pay extra for Caicedo, and get Rice and go for Gundogan on a free, and move on from Xhaka.

There‚Äôs an element of ruthlessness we need to make sure we capitalize on our success and continue to build, and don‚Äôt end up like Liverpool

Edit: that dream scenario assuming we got caicedo instead of Jorginho, we have him now, no longer want Gundogan",Arsenal,Yes,j78m3lp,t1_j78jcaj
"You have to see what happened though and assess if changes need to be made.

"What has Mudryk shown so far that assures you he is a ‚Äòbig miss‚Äô. Wait for him to score or at least assist a goal. Are people still starstruck because he dribbled past a 40 year old Milner who had been playing for an hour?

Imo it‚Äôs the complete opposite with him and Trossard. Trossard has played full matches in the PL and proven himself so he can rotate with Martinelli.

If Mudryk had come he would have developed slowly and in the meantime would come on as an impact sub. 

Way to raw to be starting him in PL and CL. And before you say, he was good in the CL last year. He was the best out of Shaktar and that‚Äôs not saying that much.",Arsenal,Yes,j7642t6,t1_j7631mc

He's getting leeway because the press always give teams that spend time because otherwise they'd have to admit that the transfers that make up probably 90% of their biggest headlines aren't actually the answer and that's not going to happen when you need daily or even 24 hour rolling sports news.,Arsenal,Yes,j75w8pu,t1_j75vp0k
That‚Äôs fair but he was class today. Defensively and offensively. It‚Äôs easy to say all he did was stop play and bare minimum but that‚Äôs just not true. He was incredible all round. Kept a close eye on him too and he was impressive.,Arsenal,Yes,j76xlx8,t1_j76wis7

"Teams show him down the left and he just sprints down to that side and does nothing, as you said he gets a lucky corner or something. He is way too predictable. He doesn‚Äôt have the ability to glide around the pitch and that shiftiness that Saka has or even Trossard. 

Even when he scored against west ham and brighton I thought he still played very poorly. He needs a run out of the team and to run at defences as a super sub. The game will become easier for him and he‚Äôll be able to get at tired defences.",Arsenal,Yes,j771gv5,t1_j76zchd
"I still thought he played poorly in a lot of games this season and they were covered up by a goal or an assist, which is why I was never really sold on his ranking as a player. Saka was struggling early season but he was still making the correct decisions on and off the ball and helping the team function properly. Martinelli has been breaking down attacks for months now, he‚Äôs too predictable when he runs at defenders and makes bad decisions too often.",Arsenal,Yes,j772ofp,t1_j771too

"I actually think it goes the other way tbh. I think people think that you can't criticise Martinelli, and so over egg the pudding the other way. 

I'm not saying you're doing that, but I do reject what OP is saying when they say he 'rarely beats his man'.

I think a fair criticism is that he's very take on orientated, all he wants to do is beat his man and when it's not working, he ends up running into cul de sacs time and again.

But he's absolutely roasted some of the best defenders in the league. It's generally speaking what he's best at. You'd have to think that's what Arteta is asking him to do, break the lines with dribbling. 

Ultimately, he's 21. He's going to have flaws in his game. He's basically a one man army on the left wing at the minute with Zinchenko underlapping into midfield and Eddie staying largely central. With an overlapping fullback or Jesus/Xhaka going out to help, you see a different Martinelli.",Arsenal,Yes,j78m798,t1_j78fzli

I don't know if you watched arsenal more than a year. Martinelli and Tierny used to play a lot of games together in previous seasons. They had zero chemistry. They just ran into each other a lot. It never worked. That's why you don't see them playing together.,Arsenal,Yes,j79jcah,t1_j7755dw
"You're probably not rude, but you're def and idiot getting worked up misunderstanding what I said. I didn't say martinelli is as bad as pepe. 

I compared the fans who kept saying then, that Pepe needs an overlapping fullback to play well. Now we are repeating the same thing with martinelli. He is off form, he needs some time on the bench",Arsenal,Yes,j79hkl7,t1_j7791kr

"Mount was poor but Cucu was fine his job was to invert and underlap to give Mudryk space to run because he's a touchline winger.

"Your comment is filled with hyperboles and hypocrisy which means you're more interested in the banter than actual discussion. As a banter-centric submission, I agree with it. 

But to ride back to an actual discussion:

‚Äî When you tell me to wait until he scores or assists, it's a very simplistic way of seeing players. This is how we thought ESR would keep Odegaard out of the XI. Because the only way to see that a player is good is G/A. People see new players and quickly google up G/A. No wonder people still thought Pepe would come good. 


‚Äî Then you simplify Mudryk's cameo to 'beating 40 year old Milner'. This isn't 2000 where the game has disappeared from the Internet. Watch it and see if that's all he did in that game. 


‚Äî You also tell me to wait, but are slandering the same player without waiting. 

‚Äî I think he's a big miss because we gladly pushed to break our transfer record for him. Not just that, his ex-managers and every report we got showed that he has the potential to be a top 2-3 player in his position. It explains why two clubs fought for him. 

‚Äî Also thinking we were about to spend ‚Ç¨95M on a bench player is a bit naive. 

‚Äî Discarding performances in weaker leagues is also a vice that some of you need to outgrow. Luka Modric ran rings around people straight out of the Croatian League. Good players are good regardless. Also saying Mudryk wouldn't start a CL game is wild. 

I'll enjoy slandering Mudryk as I'm still salty about losing him, but I need the discussion labeled from the start on if it's banter or serious.",Arsenal,Yes,j7663bt,t1_j7642t6
The few times I've seen us put ESR in the middle I've not been impressed. He's much better when he has space to run at defenders or to arrive unannounced in the box and that's much harder to do from central mid,Arsenal,Yes,j77p9cl,t1_j77ozwn
Catholics Vs Protestants looking at a mere 80 year rivalry thinking 'thats cute',Arsenal,Yes,j75xknx,t1_j75wv06
He does link up better but I think it's a cop out as to why he isn't playing well. If you look at the things he was doing individually in the first half of the season it is very different to what he is doing now. He is very loose in possession and his touch has gone missing.,Arsenal,Yes,j78d7oq,t1_j78cz11
"Never be afraid of saying something just because the sub will be angry. In my early days here, I was like this; made a lot of takes that were just feel good stuff to fit in. You realise you're being dishonest. 

I learnt that honest takes age well more often than reactionary ones. 

Saying Ozil is the problem was once pretty unpopular here. I remember watching Auba become shit in real time and making the observation but people fought it with all kinds of excuses. 

Make your claim. Defend it. But most importantly, be ready to learn. Some guys here actually know their stuff. 

Back to Gabbie, there is no system change or personnel that can make you miss easy passes and fall to beat your man as many times as he fails. It's either mental or raw ability and pointing out that he needs to do better shouldn't make you feel bad. 

To contradict myself a little tho, yeah. Sometimes let people have fun. Keep it to yourself. I still have unpopular opinions I rather not say too lol. People think this team is complete for some reason.",Arsenal,Yes,j78i1f9,t1_j78c5bs

You‚Äôre just repeating what I said. Still has zero end product which forced him to play deeper because he was a donkey in front of goal,Arsenal,Yes,j77lz1y,t1_j77l1n1
"Chelsea's squad before their summer's transfers were at the end of their life cycle, which was why Tuchel had a terrible time. They had CBs who wanted to leave or couldn't defend, midfielders whose ages were showing and started getting injuries (see Kante). Wingers who didn't press and couldn't dribble and beat defenders 1v1. And basically nobody at striker, to the extent that they had to buy the ghost of Aubameyang

They were due a HUGE refresh, similar to when pep first came or when Arteta took over

It's not as dissimilar. If we look at current teams, Liverpool's another team that's due a refresh also. And they're not getting it, which is why they are at mid table. Chelsea right now is where we were 2 years ago

We can check back in after Potter's had a full preseason. I sincerely doubt they'd be as trash as they are right now",Arsenal,Yes,j75xttm,t1_j75xahz
"He'd be great in Xhaka's role and was even appearing wide like a winger. Would bring Trossard into more natural positions for him.

Two issues are, is his passing consistent enough? He's been great everytime I've seen him but many say he's a shit passer. 

Secondly, the sort of aggression he was showing...he'd be a yellow card magnet...ref was weak today and let it become a physical game like Southampton one. Not every game is like that.",Arsenal,Yes,j773bn2,t1_j76xlx8
"Yes he did. But he went to the Man United academy, not the first team after he just signed",Arsenal,Yes,j761uxp,t1_j7611su
"A lot of academy players come from other teams, don't they?",Arsenal,Yes,j761xjs,t1_j7616sb
"1) Football is a results-based sport like every other but managers are rated on how they have their team playing and whether their approach is sustainable, so performances do matter. If a team wins because they were clinical with their chances while the opposition had a bad day converting their chances, that has little to do with the manager‚Äôs tactics, or at least that of a good one. No reliable or effective gameplan should rely on basically getting lucky.

2) That‚Äôs mostly a cliche broadcasters use to hype the Premier League. Of course any team is capable of beating even a big side on a good day like Everton just did but there are definitely easy fixtures in the league, or at least fixtures you‚Äôre expected to win. Also, the run United went on under Rangnick wasn‚Äôt even that good. In addition to their defeat, they dropped points in games where they were the favourites. If there truly isn‚Äôt such a thing as an easy fixture, you‚Äôd see teams winning the league with 70-75 points, and I‚Äôm probably being generous with that points total. 

Newcastle didn‚Äôt immediately become good under Eddie Howe. Their performances only started improving after their January signings. Before they faced United, they had lost three straight games conceding 11 goals, and only won once. At the time, it was definitely seen as a bad result for United. 

3) I disagree, two games is practically insignificant in this discussion. Besides, it contradicts the idea of a new manager bounce for Emery, since he lost his first couple of games.",Arsenal,Yes,j7amq6p,t1_j7abt23
"We sometimes do. Sometimes with a little more trickery ala Mitoma, Martinelli has chances to be 1v1 with the keeper or at least eliminate one DF for a good chance. He then decides to pause and try to burn pace past his man. Many defenders now know this and wait for him to do it...then he loses the ball.",Arsenal,Yes,j7735dv,t1_j772rx0
It is what it is. One game at a time.,Arsenal,Yes,j77pubn,t1_j77pj2a
It comes down to price in terms of whether I'd want him here. His current deal expires 2024. He'd have 1 year remaining and if he gennuinely wants to join and refuses to recontract with Chelsea we might be able to get a decent deal. However with the English tax he might still wind up being 50m pounds though and at that price we might be able to find better alternatives. 45ishm and below it's a go IMO even if he's got a year left. I think he's really really good,Arsenal,Yes,j75w5l3,t1_j75vh4m
Our record vs Everton at goodison is bad we should change that,Arsenal,Yes,j75wqj5,t1_j75w8lh
"Or make the winner of the FA cup get an automatic group-stage berth in the Champions League.

I was being somewhat hyperbolic but I don't think I am wrong. If you constantly try the same thing then it is inevitable he will beat his man sometimes but over the course of 90 minutes he just doesn't do it enough to justify his presence on the pitch.

"Re Martinelli, part of it may be confidence, but that's arguably a second order consequence of missing Jesus: he doesn't get played in to the positions where he's most dangerous, then starts to lose trust in the other parts of his game. 

Ultimately, though, Martinelli is not a one on one player like Saka; he can push it around a defender but he doesn't have the same precision in tight spaces. He can be a great wide player for us in the right setup, with someone who can get him the ball on the run toward goal. Figuring out how to get him going with Nketiah in the middle, and Odegaard playing on the right side of the pitch, is a big challenge for Arteta to work through.",Arsenal,Yes,j797oye,t1_j78i1f9

"Boehly was stupid enough to sack Chelsea's entire back room staff but caught on quick that instead of being taken for a ride by other clubs he could let English clubs negotiate a deal and swoop in at the last minute to gazump it and probably pay less than if he'd done it himself.

Unfortunately (or fortunately) he seems quite willing to promise whatever is needed to do that where someone with experience might have told him he was being taken for a ride or that effectively using a player as just a pawn without taking into account his feelings might not be the greatest idea for a guy you want on an 8 year contract.

I'm also slightly of the opinion he's not really grasped the sheer global nature of football over baseball. I wonder if he's trying so hard to stop his rivals getting their number one targets is because he thinks there's a more limited pool of players and we won't be able to find someone as effective.

"The Arsenal ticketing site is an actual disgrace, completely unfit for purpose. I'm not even talking about the queueing system when tickets go on sale, which would need an entire other essay. 

I was on the exchange for the Brentford game literally day yesterday. I work from home, so I can have it open on my laptop and refresh every few minutes. I must've refreshed well over a thousand times yesterday. This is where the problems start. 

If you refresh the page about 8-9 times, you get thrown out and locked out for a while. Not a problem, I can use a private browsing window. I get on the private window, I have to do a captcha. Captcha barely works half the time, takes ages to get in. I get to the list of events screens, I click Brentford, another captcha. Same as before. I get on the tickets screen - session expired. I have to go back and log in again. I click the Brentford event, another captcha. Rinse and repeat all day.

I did this for hours yesterday, and I saw three tickets go up the entire day. Here's how that goes: Refresh page, see a ticket available, click it in the sidebar, ticket gone. In no less than 2 seconds, the ticket has gone. How the fuck is this system supposed to be workable? It needs a complete rework. 

My proposal: since it's basically already a raffle depending on if you can get passed all the captchas, session timeouts, and click the ticket in time - why not make it an actual raffle. For each game you want to go to, you sign up to the ""I want a ticket"" list. When a ticket is listed on the exchange, it gets randomly given, lottery style, to one of these accounts. 

Oh, and by the way, if you go on StubHub or whatever else trashy websites, you can see hunderds of tickets to this game for sale for ¬£300. Club needs to do something, because this is a disgrace.",Arsenal,No,j71391t,t3_10seuct

"Yes.

While there have been subsequent reports that muddied the waters, the reporting in the window was that getting Caicedo would not have altered our pursuit of Rice come summer.

There is a very strong chance Jorginho will want to leave when we sign someone (e.g. notably Rice)  and we won't stand in his way.

There is a strong chance Xhaka will leave when he's no longer starting.

A single signing (e.g. Rice) could do both; two would certainly do it.

Elneny probably would stay to be Gunnersaurus, but at a certain point, he'll go too.

Sambi *might* find himself at Palace and come back, but at this point, doubt is reasonable.

We'll have plenty of room in the squad, even if we bring Patino home.",Arsenal,Yes,j71idro,t1_j717xcr
"> I think Jorginho will go to Lazio or something after the season finishes

I have a feeling Jorginho will be here next season. Don't think he came here -- and Arteta brought him here -- just for six months. 

I mean we've all heard about how much Arteta's wanted him over the years. Now that he finally has his man, I don't think Arteta's going to let Jorginho go this quickly.

So next season could be our first season back in the Champs League after a while. Think having someone like Jorginho who's a proven winner at European level and who has experience of seeing out European ties will be crucial next season. Why would Arteta let all that go in 6 months?

What could happen is Jorginho stays for the rest of this season, the whole of next season, and gets sold in the summer of 2024. We'll still get a transfer fee after exercising our option in the contract and extending his stay by a year.

Now the question is what does this mean for the pursuit of Rice and Caicedo. I think Jorginho coming means we won't go for the both of them.

From what Ornstein said in an athletic podcast a few days ago, there's been a lot of behind the scenes work done to get Rice. So if Rice comes in as everyone says he will, and Jorginho's there too, I don't think Arsenal will be going for Caicedo again.

According to reports, Arsenal have extended Elneny's stay by a year too. Caicedo coming in as well will lead to a bloated squad with just too many midfielders.

So I think it will just be Rice coming in the summer.",Arsenal,Yes,j71sj58,t1_j717xcr

"It's weird, they have a strange habit of assuming transfer successes before they have even played.

Ndombele and Lo Celso big money flops, but apparently Romero, Richarlison and Porro (despite not even playing) are proof they have fixed their recruitment?! 

Richarlison wasn't even that good for Everton..... Romeo plays in legitimately the worst defence in the league and if you watch Spurs he's only really good at one on one's and interceptions outside of the box, he's pretty horrific positonally and defending his box, and we be exposed pretty soon. 

It's taken them till now to move away from the Peresic is the best player in his position narrative.

Delusional.",Arsenal,Yes,j715855,t1_j7105sk

"Bound to happen. Both two very similar players who are in peak forms and massive prospects (Saka more so), both wingers, both play for two teams in which the fans hate each other. Both scored cracking goals in the game recently and did the same celebration. 

Only difference is Rashford is 4 years older than Saka. Saka‚Äôs ceiling of potential is absolutely ridiculous when you think about it.",Arsenal,Yes,j72mzeb,t1_j72lcfy
"You're not trying to recoup the money in sales 

The value for top teams is in winning.
How much value did our fans and team get from the last half decade of no champions league football?

It's down to results, not the margins on the spreadsheets.",Arsenal,Yes,j716rcd,t1_j7164m5

I cannot think of a player less compatible with DycheBall than Pepe,Arsenal,Yes,j710rxp,t1_j710esl

"Yeah. Too much turnover, and their clueless fans just don't seem to register the fact that when you give a new manager 16 new players, not all of which he wanted, it's gonna take some time.

"There was a short period of time when Rashford was linked with PSG and us. And I thought he would be a baller under Arteta. NowTen Haag has revived him and that looks impossible. 

This is how I feel about CHO too. Both of them are players with incredible potential that were mismanaged by their teams. If he was cheap enough and motivated enough I think he is worth a punt",Arsenal,Yes,j71va1d,t1_j71h7ol
"Great potential, I like him. He's been around for a while and not quite kicked on, so people have lost patience. Give him a suitable environment and consistent minutes and he'll go up a level.

It's a similar odd to Brugge winning the CL",Arsenal,Yes,j74j62e,t1_j74eddk
"It's not impossible for them to drop in the table... But relegation isn't even in the realm of likelihood. Most seasons 35 points is enough to be safe.

I do think liverpool see likely to pass them, and villa have been getting results under emery. Palace and forest could push chelsea. But i think that's about it.",Arsenal,Yes,j75l5lk,t1_j74eddk

Saka definitely,Arsenal,Yes,j718212,t1_j717aik
"Xhaka for me. The turnaround has shown what an absolute diamond this bloke is as a human imo. Could‚Äôve left when everything was going to shit, stayed and fought hard for not only his place in the team but to win back the fans. It‚Äôs a terrific story.",Arsenal,Yes,j718u0u,t1_j717aik

"I think xhaka gets very close, his redemption arc will become a significant part of Arsenal history. 

Arteta definitely becomes a legend",Arsenal,Yes,j71lga5,t1_j717aik
"It's business, by playing him in a League game we stand to receive huge compensation if someone else sign him. If he plays in U23 instead of U18 compensation goes up, appearance in a League game will go up significantly.",Arsenal,Yes,j75lw43,t1_j75g80s

"> It‚Äôs in their culture to expect immediate results which I doubt Potter can deliver now. 

That's the fundamantal issues I see with Chelsea that gives me hope for the future.

Abramovich spent hugely but he didn't sign to stupid contracts and he always backed new managers with new signings because that's what instant return managers want. Yes it led to a few bad years and they've finished mid table a couple of times but then he always spent the next year with a new short term specialist and all was great.

Now Boehly has spent big and he thinks he's found the cheat code with stupidly long contracts but if Potter isn't given time or can't work with these players then things become very interesting.

Get in another project manager and possibly miss out on CL again is OK if you're us but the majority shareholder in Chelsea is an investment capital firm and they are going to want a return on their investment. More pertinently the Chelsea fans expect shiny new players every year, they expect trophies every year and after Boehly Big Bollocks spent half a billion on players in his first year they're going to expect him to keep doing it. 

Now he can't because the amortisation would kill them and because they simply don't ahve enough squad spaces so you get in a guy to turn things round quickly...and then you're aking a Conte or a Jose to win without spending on 'their' players and a brief look at Spurs shows you how that goes both from a silverware and happiness perspective.

Now there are caveats; Chelsea's owners agreed not to sell for a decade so there is a project time scale in there built in and he has bought *so* many players that there's no way at least some of them don't turn out to be top tier eventually but even with that ¬£1.75b investment promise baked into their calculations I'm not sure the players, fans or owners will be happy to see it used to buy out contracts of players they need to get rid of and that still counts towards FFP...",Arsenal,Yes,j75kth7,t1_j75iyv5
"I think potter is ""good"" tactically, but his strength is culture building.

Its hard to implement tactics when you don't have chemistry. And it's hard to have chemistry when you spend 611m in one year, over a dozen new players over the two transfer windows.",Arsenal,Yes,j75kdsg,t1_j75iyv5
"Yeah the Brighton still doing well makes you think how big a part the club plays in setting up the team culture. 

I do think potter is still a good manager but terrible fit for Chelsea. He won't be given time or authority to build culture. He hasn't and won't be given players he wants to align to his culture / tactics. Look at the new signings there is no take time to integrate into the team he's just throwing them on and hoping. 

I feel like he knows he has to get results in the short term so is trying to do stuff that he's not good at",Arsenal,Yes,j75l8aj,t1_j75iyv5
"I always said that a manager who is good for a mid table club isnt guaranteed success at a big club. We have Emery, Moyes and Rodgers as examples.",Arsenal,Yes,j75li2d,t1_j75iyv5
"Potter looks a passenger at Chelsea, all these players he didn't need or particularly want and now he has to mould them into a team. They looked hopeless yesterday and it was beautiful. I doubt Potter will last the season.",Arsenal,Yes,j75trgm,t1_j75iyv5
Also fits perfectly into the counter pressing and second ball winning that our front five are tasked with when we go long. Really exciting to envision how he shapes our midfield,Arsenal,Yes,j71i6f1,t1_j71dbtl
"Haven't finished the episode yet but is Zubimendi not like another J20? If the manager likes him then I can't speak against it, however the prem style will always need physicality.

"Whether Rashford can keep up his form is another thing, especially if he signs a new contract. We've had many players in recent years who fell off massively after signing a big contract.

The standard that has been set at Arsenal for our legends is one that is far higher than Xhaka‚Äôs performances for us across his time here. Even this season. 

A major team accomplishment like winning the title doesn‚Äôt really move him into the ‚Äúlegend‚Äù conversation as an individual, but it does perhaps change his legacy from being a liability to someone who came of age and made the necessary contributions to help the team when it mattered.

Don't know, we don't really know what Arteta's preference order will be when it comes to the 6. Would Jorginho be 3rd choice behind Rice there, or the primary backup after Partey, we'll have to see. 

But if Jorginho is to be 3rd choice, as to why he would be ok with that, I'm just speculating here, but I think for him this Arsenal stay is primarily about working with Arteta.

He's winding down his career, so he'll do more mentorship for younger players, may look to do some coaching badges etc., this stint will help him learn Arteta's methods. 

So this move to Arsenal may be less about this stage of his career, and more about preparation for the next stage as a coach.

"That is just absolutely not true in any sense of the word.

There is no metric that shows this. Results don't. Things like average shots per game, shots against per game, expected goals, expected goals against, average possession.

"You're right, I've noticed those too. And the Eddie thing at this point it's comical how he has to prove himself every match to some of these people.

"Should be available today. Anyway with Potter agree to sell Jorginho to us simply means he is thinking 4231 with Enzo  as pivot.

You know a real potential issue with this whole thing is chelsea just scattergunned a bunch of talent with no coherent strategy and really wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Potter was less than involved.

Quantified improvement.",Arsenal,Yes,j71208w,t1_j711ase
"I mean he's only played in the Ukranian league and a few effective cup finals in the CL.

The premier league is the fastest league and as a derby match both teams were trying to make things happen too fast and constantly losing the ball.

"Most of our big commercial streams are locked in on current terms for many more years. Success will obviously matter when it comes to renewing, but they would be considering long term trends and projections.

"Ask yourself if Arteta is completely satisfied with our present 'top of the league standard' performances, or whether he's said repeatedly and emphatically that there is room for improvement.

Then compare Xhaka's performance to √òdegaard's, and ask yourself whether Arteta would start √òdegaard and his clone across the top of our midfield, or bench one of them for Xhaka.

I would also point out that Xhaka's performance as one of our pair advanced 8s has not been entirely consistent this season. Compare his attacking contributions in our first 12 PL matches to our last 7; lately, his output has regressed to his historic levels, most notably the same as an advanced 8 in the back half of last season.

He did improve along the lines Mikel demanded, over the summer and especially in those first dozen matches, and thus was not replaced; it remains to be seen what will happen over the back half of this season and next summer-- but if you're going to talk standards, √òdegaard is the standard there.",Arsenal,Yes,j72k78w,t1_j71shzl

"Well I would dispute the idea that Tierney is a ""big player"" cause right now he's a mixed bag and not someone we want to be playing a lot. Even in his latest performance against City he was our worst player yet escaped a lot of criticisms cause people would rather shit on Lokonga.

Where the difference lies though is playstyle. Brentford are direct and counter attacking while Brighton are possession-based. Could Brentford's playstyle be limiting them? Or is Newcastle proof that they could go further?

Brighton becoming a bit of a feeder club for top clubs due to similar playstyle, while Brentford have been pretty inactive in transfer market last couple seasons, which will pay dividends in the end?

I don't know why we don't go all in on Bellingham this summer, especially if we win the EPL or go down to the wire with Man City for the title.  
  
Financials:

Assume six year contract, keep five years, sell.

Bellingham: buy for 150M, wages 300k per week, sell for 100M at age 24. 

Rice: buy for 80M, wages 200k per week, sell for 20M at age 29.

Those financials work out roughly about the same net expense. 

So we have competition from City and Liverpool. So what. With the core of Bellingham, Saka, Jesus, Saliba, Odegaard we firmly are a top five team in the world for the next several years. He's got England team homies with him: Saka, Ramsdale, White. Arteta is obviously playing a very compelling style of football.

One of Xhaka/Partey : This is purely based on the talk about us wanting both Caicedo and Rice. Assuming that does happen and seeing that Jorginho might still be around for a year, there's probably no way we would have Xhaka, Partey, Jorginho, Caicedo and Rice all on the same squad.

Arsenal: Leno, Bellerin, Sokratis, Luiz, Saka (at LB), Torreira, Xhaka, Ozil, Pepe, Laca, Auba",Arsenal,Yes,j6wj9vp,t1_j6w6srk
Actually what antics does jorginho has? He has his share of defensive blunders and any slow player in the prem is always gonna be exposed and memed but its not like he got sent off regularly like xhaka did or riled up the opposition like richarlison. Its azpilicueta i have a problem with from chelsea.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w9pzf,t1_j6w8yrc
BFG making all the kids in the academy feel extra safe and sheltered.,Arsenal,Yes,j6xdfaa,t1_j6xcvc1
Finishing above us in our banter years is their trophy. Those lot are completely ambitionless,Arsenal,Yes,j6zbldx,t1_j6z9ubt
Expressions is the only good thing about spurs,Arsenal,Yes,j6zqjmu,t1_j6z9ubt
I‚Äôm certainly interested to see how he does under Arteta instead of boring Chelsea,Arsenal,Yes,j6wv9u7,t1_j6wswxx
"Jorginho is elit regista. Always rate him during Sarriball and last Euro. He is cheat code on possession football. As long as Saliba Gabriel and White cover him, his pace deficiency should be covered.

Hope Arteta rekindled his form. This could be the case like when Pirlo was released by Milan to Juventus. Jorginho might be our most important transfer after all. I can somehow, smell it from afar.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wxndj,t1_j6wswxx
"I think we group him in with other Chelsea signings but fail to properly understand what we need from them. Cech was supposed to close the gap to the top of the league, Luiz was supposed to replace our captain who forced his way out, Jorginho just has to replace Elneny ffs. (Lets ignore Willian for this sake lol)",Arsenal,Yes,j6x2u75,t1_j6wswxx
Balogun to score a hattrick at the toilet bowl next season,Arsenal,Yes,j6we715,t1_j6wdwbr
"You've always got your work cut out for you haven't you, people always be doubting Eddie whenever they can.

He's proven himself enough times at this point I think lol",Arsenal,Yes,j6w9zpx,t1_j6w9vuj
"People always prefer the unknowns, because you barely watch them bar stats and highlights, you‚Äôre only really judging them from their highs, compared to players you know more about.

Same with someone like Caicedo vs Jorginho, we all know who Jorginho is so can be hyper fixated on his weaknesses, but people barely know anything about Caicedo so prefer him despite being the worse player (short term).",Arsenal,Yes,j6wadyp,t1_j6w9vuj
lmao I remember at the start of last season when everyone was like 'Balogun has to start' then we got battered by Brentford and no one said a word about it again,Arsenal,Yes,j6wcnub,t1_j6w9vuj
"Fucking annoying

Until Flo is scoring at a regular rate in the PL I will not perceive him as better than Eddie.

He might be, but we don‚Äôt have enough evidence yet",Arsenal,Yes,j6wcuxk,t1_j6w9vuj
Your defence is in trouble,Arsenal,Yes,j6wdkly,t1_j6wdg3t
"Boehly needs a kick in the head, guy is notoriously an asshole",Arsenal,Yes,j6xft5y,t1_j6x9hfl
literally one older couple who live near Stamford Bridge stopped their whole stadium rebuild on account of their light rights. Be surprised if Boehly could get it done,Arsenal,Yes,j6xa43s,t1_j6x9hfl
NYT is tier 1 for sports. They mainly do investigative reporting so not much is current but what they say is the truth or was the truth.,Arsenal,Yes,j6xhi7c,t1_j6x9hfl
"Leeds felt more like mental. It was insane. All of a sudden, players were all shit lol. Tactically, we had them on the hinges for the first half. 

United was a balanced game. We finish better, we win.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ye3vc,t1_j6y1bfy
Leeds is the only time this year where we‚Äôve been outplayed. We were better than utd at OT imo.,Arsenal,Yes,j6yh88i,t1_j6y1bfy
"In fact the Leeds game we were beaten tactically. And i must say that was the craziest pressing game I saw in my 59 yrs, how did they manage that intensity I was left speechless.",Arsenal,Yes,j6y4vx3,t1_j6y1bfy
"Nah, we got found out in the Leeds game. Lucky to escape there with a point let alone three. Other than that one game though, I agree.",Arsenal,Yes,j6y5nmo,t1_j6y1bfy
"I know everyone is mentioning the Leeds game but I felt we scored at the right times against Brighton too, they played really well and if not for the offside goal I reckon they would have got a draw.",Arsenal,Yes,j6z9pgf,t1_j6y1bfy
"It's the fact that everyone's been trying to put us down ***""oh they haven't played anyone serious yet""*** to ***""they will start to crumble without Jesus post WC""*** to whatever else shit prediction there is next. We just keep on going like an unstoppable train W after W and it's tasty AF :)",Arsenal,Yes,j6wh0vq,t1_j6wgh4w
"IF we sell Balogun anywhere, we 100% need to have a buyback clause or at least first refusal.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wf6uf,t1_j6w8e0h
We can always move Jesus to RW. Saves us a shit ton of cash as well.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w8idh,t1_j6w8e0h
"Gabriel did clean it up after the Leeds game. Some Saliba mistakes in the same time but most of them didn't result in goals.

I think it's fine, we are playing a highline and they are both young. Most CBs need experience to become better.",Arsenal,Yes,j6woht3,t1_j6wntql
"Oh that's the exciting part of it all. Our performance has been consistent, it doesn't feel like any sort of short term uptick.

If we continue to perform like the 1st half of the season, then we're winning the league. 

I would say that our squad is stronger after transfers than before the transfer window opened.
Whereas City are weaker.

Obviously a big game coming up against them that could make a big impact",Arsenal,Yes,j6woxa1,t1_j6wntql
"Only 5 matches out of 19 have we conceded an open play goal when the game has been within a goal difference (Brighton/Leicester up 2+). 8 meaningful open play goals allowed, only 3 of those did we not answer with a goal of our own. Pretty remarkable when you think about it.

UTD (A) they scored 3 nice goals even if we were a bit naive and had Sambi, Pool (H) they had a nice 1 and a kinda janky/mistake 1, Soton (A) they opened us up for 1, Fulham (H) big mistake, and UTD (H) they scored 1 of individual brilliance and we made an error on a corner for another. 
 
The fact that we're in the spot we're in while making errors is super encouraging. We'll never cut them out totally, but it also means there's probably not a correction coming either.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wyky0,t1_j6wntql
"They got lucky with a series of youth products. 

Obviously Kane in particular but Bale was massive for them as well. I genuinely think Kane is massively underrated. Once he goes that club goes into mid table. 

Getting a striker like that for free has basically elevated them way above where they‚Äôd be for a decade.",Arsenal,Yes,j6zsgr1,t1_j6zootu
Their expectations are too high... Another problem is their rivals are doing better.,Arsenal,Yes,j6zropy,t1_j6zootu
"To be fair they're in our early banter years.

Nice stadium, top four, pretty football, most expensive tickets in the league, making a profit every year and we got shit on it for not winning trophies.

Now thy haven't got the pretty football and to be fair to them they've got the Greatest Striker in Premier League History ^TM and they've wasted him. I understand the issues because they're on a footing that should be bringing in something other than just top four.",Arsenal,Yes,j6zrjt6,t1_j6zootu
You know what the big difference has been: poch and Kane. They‚Äôre now stuck in a weird win now or rebuild cycle.,Arsenal,Yes,j6zqb7x,t1_j6zootu
[removed],Arsenal,Yes,j6zox49,t1_j6zootu
I think we can all agree that we are addicted to watch Arsenal games and days without it are like when we are on withdrawal symptoms,Arsenal,Yes,j6xj548,t1_j6xhp3m
"I know people don't want to hear this, but I didn't really care about the FA cup match too much, and so it feels like we've gone two weeks without a game.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xmzex,t1_j6xhp3m
"because the fa cup match against city felt a bit more like a warmup match than a ""we gotta win this"" match. it was also on a friday.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xi226,t1_j6xhp3m
"And Gary neville is expecting united to finish ahead of us. He's also wrong 100% of the time.

Now what?",Arsenal,Yes,j6wpt81,t1_j6wpp7e
"Me too. I just hope he does above everyone‚Äôs expectations and gets a new contract. The talent is obviously there, he just needs to apply it.


It will help us to not worry about the RW position with Saka and him come summer.",Arsenal,Yes,j6z6n0w,t1_j6yxzst
ohhhh Martinelli dodododo dodoo,Arsenal,Yes,j6zdq0t,t1_j6zdf9m

"Lewis was annoyingly good against us, think theyve unearthed a gem there",Arsenal,Yes,j6w4myu,t1_j6w46xe
Waiting for a Mitro masterclass,Arsenal,Yes,j6x1uk2,t1_j6wxcvx
"Honestly I think they'll improve enough to where they'll come within something like 3 points of top 4. It'll be close, and if Potter isn't the right guy, they might even still have time to get something out of the UCL with a better manager. Maybe I'm overreacting, but they did it in 2012 while being shit in the league.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wzwg5,t1_j6wxcvx

Spurs have failed us once already. Only Spurs can let even their rivals down,Arsenal,Yes,j6z7434,t1_j6z63ke
"Had a spurs fan at my gym tell me he hopes spurs lose vs city to ""keep the pressure on"" and It took more strength than my max lift to not laugh in his face",Arsenal,Yes,j6zcble,t1_j6z63ke
Emery is gonna do us no favour when we go to villa park either lol.,Arsenal,Yes,j6zj5qj,t1_j6z63ke
I love that the only thing spurs and United can now do is take points off our rivals.,Arsenal,Yes,j6z6xbp,t1_j6z63ke

"We have a better start than any season in their history.

Guess their entire history is a disaster.",Arsenal,Yes,j6z78xm,t1_j6z60sl
"both having good seasons.

Saka is on pace to beat Rashford's league stats in the season Rashford was 21yrs old.  Rashford isn't.....",Arsenal,Yes,j6z7rgn,t1_j6z60sl
We‚Äôre still firmly in EL contention lol,Arsenal,Yes,j6z77ft,t1_j6z60sl
"Why would I give a shit? We're fighting for the title only losers care about individual accomplishments
Btw Manutd's only output is Rashford we saw that when we played against them 
We have goal and assists spread all over our squad",Arsenal,Yes,j6z985f,t1_j6z60sl
Just think of it as another week closer to a fully fit ESR and Jesus,Arsenal,Yes,j70d35b,t1_j70a22i
"The academy‚Äôs been great for a while but taking loans more seriously and hiring a guy to oversee them is now maxing out that potential. Flo, Patino, BNC, Nuno, Trusty all looking like helping the Arsenal first team or getting us a big fee.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wghkq,t1_j6wddra
"A few people whinged about the wages, but that contract was an excellent bit of business.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xiafy,t1_j6xguou
"Almost lost Balogun aswell, did very well to keep them both",Arsenal,Yes,j6xh1vz,t1_j6xguou
"I know you're thinking of those alisson to salah beauts but that's just not really how we play... Liverpool love to play quickly on the counter so that suits them, for us we love to advance the ball up the field pass by pass, cutting through the opponents lines when our players see an opportunity.

Would be nice to score like that tho I guess lol",Arsenal,Yes,j6z2qf8,t1_j6z0zws
More nervous that Saka is going to get hacked to pieces by Dyche‚Äôs horde.,Arsenal,Yes,j6z3pv3,t1_j6z18yg
Probably because we haven't won at Goodison in our last 4 trips...,Arsenal,Yes,j6z368d,t1_j6z18yg

We suck at Everton away that‚Äôs why,Arsenal,Yes,j6zr6wn,t1_j6z18yg
"I am always wary about new manager bounces. 

That said we absolutely should beat them. I was worried they‚Äôd make a load of signings on deadline day and that didn‚Äôt haooe.",Arsenal,Yes,j6z2ffa,t1_j6z18yg
We lost to them last year. This team that we have is on a mission to redeem themselves from their mistakes last year.,Arsenal,Yes,j6zmfxx,t1_j6z18yg
"Every game feels like a cup final. Any game could turn into a slip up and if its not a tough one like City or Newcastle then it feels really bad afterwards.

It feels great to be nervous about every game, 2-3 years ago I couldn't care less. Now we care because we're competing to take it all home",Arsenal,Yes,j6z2aur,t1_j6z18yg
It's a banana slip game in many ways.,Arsenal,Yes,j6z44e9,t1_j6z18yg
"To ease your mind, they‚Äôre really bad. Dyche or Frank they can‚Äôt score. We‚Äôre gonna smoke them and you‚Äôll get to happily watch the replay stress free.",Arsenal,Yes,j6z52dj,t1_j6z18yg
"Good for him to learn from Viera, too",Arsenal,Yes,j6z7eeh,t1_j6z32qn
This could be interpreted in a certain way lol,Arsenal,Yes,j6z71wq,t1_j6z32qn
"yeah of course

Untied fans were yapping about it, while having CR7 in their squad.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xrdcu,t1_j6xqum9
Laughable if you look at r/soccer comments to bissouma‚Äôs case https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/vninbr/yves_bissouma_is_cleared_of_sexual_assault,Arsenal,Yes,j6xt8u9,t1_j6xqum9
"Partey is a non-topic if Arsenal are 6th in the League, or if the shit club's - who have a large presence online - were performing on the pitch. The booing in away stadiums ends the moment Arsenal no longer threaten their club's ambitions.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xslvs,t1_j6xqum9
"even any attempts at trying to bring some nuance into the debate is met with them claiming im condoning rape. 

There is so much incredibly shady shit that is happening in football, so much they could focus on even Messi would be a target if they really cared, but they mainly care about point scoring and trying to diminsh what arsenal is currently doing.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xvla8,t1_j6xqum9

My work wants me to travel to the main offices in a different country in the coming weeks. Told them I cant go if it's that week. No way I'm going to be out doing some team get together dinner the night we batter city at the Emirates under the lights.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wifs9,t1_j6wekjb
"I'm hoping I'll be inbetween a new job and my current job by then, the timing might work out",Arsenal,Yes,j6wffbn,t1_j6wekjb

"Twitter is an absolute dungeon. Especially now since Elon Musk came on the scene, the algorithm seems to show me more and more extreme/ concerning content. Have only kept my account to refresh on Fabrizio Romano‚Äôs page during transfer windows.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xb526,t1_j6xapmw
"I have definitely thought about it. Especially in relation to a lot of shit you see on twitter. Especially since covid, so much misinformation and bullshit spreads so quickly and is believed by so many without so much as a second thought that it seems utterly futile to even consider starting a dialogue with them in the hopes that they'll see how ridiculous their beliefs are.

People can spout insane bullshit in 280 characters that would take a fucking essay to begin to refute.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xbbt5,t1_j6xapmw
"Life is far far better if all of social media was deleted. That's when one will find true zen. I find it funny when people on social media criticise drug addicts when social media is a drug itself. Either way Reddit or Heroin, your soul still being destroyed.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xijof,t1_j6xapmw
"I‚Äôd recommend following who you like (don‚Äôt let it get out of hand where you‚Äôre on Twitter all day keeping up), and don‚Äôt look at replies unless you‚Äôre truly interested. The big accounts are absolute cesspools of weirdos but legit analysis is usually responded to by legit analysis as well. Remember that it‚Äôs ok for others to have a differing viewpoint and not to get invested in it",Arsenal,Yes,j6xcimh,t1_j6xapmw
He was close to joining Forest. He is clearly not a top level player anymore.,Arsenal,Yes,j6xls9k,t1_j6xjqxk
That contract renewal followed by the dip in form is gonna be hilarious,Arsenal,Yes,j6xwnim,t1_j6xweq2
Haha I keep seeing people parading around his stats in all competitions to make him out to be the best winger in Europe. Fucking ridiculous.,Arsenal,Yes,j6xy1q2,t1_j6xweq2
"I keep bringing this up to my united friends and they choose to ignore it.

The biggest game they‚Äôve had in weeks was the palace match. They had a chance to put themselves in the title race and Rashford played like shit and made several wrong decisions in the final third.",Arsenal,Yes,j6y9ufd,t1_j6xweq2
It is not like he is doing nothing in the league. The man is having a good season,Arsenal,Yes,j6y39la,t1_j6xweq2
There was a stat that Barca in effect paid for the stadium with our players who turned out to be flops (and 2 non-flops I‚Äôm still grumpy about).,Arsenal,Yes,j6wijxk,t1_j6wi0uv
I remember the meme (or joke as we used to call them back in the day) was that we sold them the gun without the bullets (RVP),Arsenal,Yes,j6wqdb8,t1_j6wi0uv
Using the inflation measures across all goods and services doesn't really account for the fact the football transfer market has inflated much faster.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wc44e,t1_j6wbxq0
"Football inflation does not work like that, transfer fees increase relative to increase in the revenue of clubs

Transfer fees are probably similar to 30 years ago in comparison to revenue, otherwise clubs would just have free money lying around if they didn't spend it on players",Arsenal,Yes,j6wca87,t1_j6wbxq0
The commercial growth of football teams probably doesn‚Äôt match the growth of transfer fees. Highbury use to give Arsenal about ¬£30 mil in revenues and now the Emirates gives us ¬£90 mil. Why everyone is probably agitating for the Super League.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wg8ov,t1_j6wbxq0
*breaks pool cue menacingly*,Arsenal,Yes,j6wf7j2,t1_j6wf4vr
Not straightaway. He'll go to Turkey or Qatar or something for some image rehab first.,Arsenal,Yes,j6x3jwa,t1_j6x2mj8
i think you are naive because prem and efl clubs are no strangers to signing and playing players accused of such crimes,Arsenal,Yes,j6x3bbn,t1_j6x2mj8
You don‚Äôt think Everton would? Lee Hughes literally killed someone and had a football League career,Arsenal,Yes,j6x3yi1,t1_j6x2mj8
Dude.. we literally have an accused player in our squad.,Arsenal,Yes,j6x3rgc,t1_j6x2mj8

"Yes, the suffering of Greenwood's victim was certainly worth it to slightly mud Gary Neville.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xx728,t1_j6xwkqu
Even after you correct for partisan fan base bias‚Ä¶the situations are objectively different. There‚Äôs really no comparison. There were receipts on Greenwood and he was duly indicted. Partey is (if reports are true) several steps behind that point procedurally.,Arsenal,Yes,j6zk5hu,t1_j6z5ij9
"Also worth bearing in mind that there's a decent chance Patino will be in the squad next season.

I have a suspicion Arteta is going to want to make himself a Right Zinchenko, so we could make a play for a very young, very promising midfielder he thinks he can shape at RB.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wcome,t1_j6wbjnl
"not when he‚Äôs on your side. if he takes a pen for us, man could do a front flip then shoot, as long as it goes in",Arsenal,Yes,j6zoc5m,t1_j6zmhb9

Tribalism really blinds people,Arsenal,Yes,j6x5c0k,t1_j6x412l
"To me, ESR feels like the odd one out in the attack and probably develops deeper into the LCM as has been suggested by many. We then have: Trossard, Martinelli, Jesus, Nketiah, Saka & Balogun.

Trossard and Jesus can both play across the front three, Balogun up front and LW, Martinelli LW, Saka both wings, Nketiah CF. Plenty of rotation opportunities and plenty of competition there.",Arsenal,Yes,j6we2ud,t1_j6wd1mg
It‚Äôs almost too many strikers given we play 4-3-3. One would get basically no minutes in the league unless we move Jesus out wide (which I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be against).,Arsenal,Yes,j6wdlke,t1_j6wd1mg
1 of them would barely play unless Jesus is moved to the wings.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wdcje,t1_j6wd1mg
"I‚Äôd be fine with that if Balogun was this finished article, but of all our options he needs the most minutes to develop. Bringing him back to start 10 games won‚Äôt be good for his development",Arsenal,Yes,j6wf2fa,t1_j6wd1mg

"He doesn't have much of an option and also Rashford is 25, in his prime. His body isn't developing like Saka so it's less of a risk.

Sancho if he even gets to 80% of his ability, should be a big player for the remainder of the season for them",Arsenal,Yes,j6wo2f6,t1_j6wnd2x
"Doesn't have a choice. Man United still have so much deadwood on the books so he has to make players like bruno and casemiro play every single game.

I can respect his strategy though, he knows united is not good enough to win the league this year so he's taking his shots at the domestic cups",Arsenal,Yes,j6wp9r1,t1_j6wnd2x
I hope so. Need more Arsenal players in there.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wvcte,t1_j6wrulc
"Man, if Jesus improves his finishing, he could be Balon D'Or good.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xejnk,t1_j6x4nlm
"Exactly the reason I always have doubts about Nketiah in our system. He is a Poacher by nature, but we need more involvement in the build up and link up.

"I mean, I love Reiss, and really want him to succeed here-- but 'manager talks up player he wants to lure' isn't the best way to support that.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xfg8b,t1_j6xeucn
"Fans can have a bit of hoarding issue. Keep all the good players and deal with the problem of minutes distribution later. Funnily enough during our ""this team is shit"" phase fans wanted a complete purging with barely enough players to field a starting 11. 

All things considered, we need to be realistic. We can't say ""just move x player to y position when we need to give them minutes"" for every player that deserves to be playing more.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wl3pw,t1_j6wig1z
I'd rather play the absolute worst teams possible whilst Chelsea keeps drawing the best teams possible. We can beat up the UCL teams next year.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wyfrr,t1_j6wwsef
no thanks man. I want to play easy teams as to not muddy or stress our rotation with the league so we can push for a PL title. I'll take a final against a big team after the league is wrapped uo,Arsenal,Yes,j6wz1am,t1_j6wwsef

"100%, in a title race + CL you‚Äôre starting your best available players every game, just as Arteta has shown to do. 

Would be harsh for him to go from playing every game in France, to maybe 10 starts max for us. Nketiah has started 14 games for us, 6 being EL which won‚Äôt be available minutes next season, and 5 in the prem, which is purely due to Jesus getting injured.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wkxdn,t1_j6wjo1x

"Or maybe not.. A few differences. 

- He had a low release clause. His price was capped around a figure.

- He's a bit more lightweight and less drilled for physical football. He's more technical than fight.

That means there is no way he goes for all that. 

Enzo had a huge release clause. Mudryk's price would have been a cool ¬£60M hadn't it been for Antony. Caicedo's numbers were more of us being desperate and Brighton issuing fuck off prices.",Arsenal,Yes,j6yocys,t1_j6ylsvj

"Both are at the age they need to be playing competitively week in week out. Neither should be riding the bench. Neither should be a third choice.

Why would we rotate against Brentford. They are one of the stronger sides this season. Especially against top 6 teams,Arsenal,Yes,j6w6uer,t1_j6w6kc8
"I'd rotate *slightly* for Brentford, but try to blow them away early then get in rest defense/sub out players.

You're just never getting that opportunity vs City and the intensity of that match makes Villa maybe the biggest banana peel of the year.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w6sf8,t1_j6w6kc8
[deleted],Arsenal,Yes,j6w6pnp,t1_j6w6kc8
"Brentford is very compact at the back, they just won't let u get into the middle. Yeah ithink Trossard can be useful, also Jorgi. Both are good against low block.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w8yep,t1_j6w6kc8
Rotating against Brentford is a stupid choice especially when you consider their big 6 record,Arsenal,Yes,j6w6xjr,t1_j6w6kc8
Probably rest both of them against Villa would be my guess.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w701m,t1_j6w6kc8
Not a big fan of the idea but if I was going to I'd pick the Brentford game as its a home game.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w71t1,t1_j6w6kc8
"I'd be very hesitant to:

Brentford's not a side we'd want to underestimate. As it stands they've been a stumbling block for other top 6 sides. Perhaps depending on the game state, say if we are comfortably up in the second half, we could sub Tierney / Jorginho on for them to see out the game so Zinny/Partey can get some rest.

For City we'd definitely have to put out a full strength side. We'll probably have to go full intensity till the final whistle blows regardless of game state - they can score 4 goals in a half if they catch a side napping, and I see it being a very close and tightly contested game.

For Villa, they are a resurgent side. For how much Emery has been memed he has been very competent at playing to his squad's strength since he's been back to the PL. I wouldn't rest Zinny and Partey here either. I'd start them and them off if the game state allows, similar to at Brentford.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w76zv,t1_j6w6kc8

"Liverpool. They'd been so dominant against us, and for us to take it to them that second half like we did and find a winner, I think this group knew then that they can win any and every game.

But honestly since preseason the vibes and confidence have been so high. They didn't lose any of those matches and smoked Chelsea/Sevilla. If you count that and the winter warm up they've gone 29-2-5. Only the UTD loss did we not rotate.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wu30f,t1_j6wrpwc
Somewhat ignoring the spirit of the question  but I think it was the way last season ended that created this monster.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wu466,t1_j6wrpwc

You've just very neatly illustrated the rather significant differences between bail in the US and bail in the UK-- to say nothing of pre-charge 'police' bail.,Arsenal,Yes,j6xegsf,t1_j6xcvoe
"I mean to be frank your entire comment is at best misleading

While presumption of innocence does place the burden of proving guilt to the state, to say it‚Äôs ‚Äúsimply a way to shift the burden of proving your guilt to the a prosecution‚Äù completely ignores the historical context of this right, the importance placed on the right at law (it being constitutionally enshrined in many countries) and also ignores that it not only places the burden on the government but equally if not more importantly requires the state to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In other words, it means precisely that the government has to give you the ‚Äúbenefit of the doubt‚Äù. 

Kind of a sus comment tbh",Arsenal,Yes,j6xfznn,t1_j6xcvoe

I'm not sure anyone has praised him as a person. As of yet there isn't any new information or a trial yet so I guess that's why it's gone a little quiet on that front. I'm sure once a trail or new evidence/developments happen it will be a discussion point again,Arsenal,Yes,j6xln1o,t1_j6xkx9z
"What has shifted? He is a good player and this season has been crucial to our success. I don't see much praise towards him beyond that though. 

At my local supporter's club, I don't see any Partey shirts. The new shirts are great and popular, i see plenty of new ones from this year (especially the black ones). despite partey being such an important on the pitch part of our success, i don't see anyone spending the money to get a partey shirt. xhaka? yes. saka? yes. jesus? yes. odegaard? yes. White? yes. saliba? yes. 

I think this is intentional. Most people are clearly uncomfortable being supportive of partey beyond saying that he had a good game.

One reason I desperately want someone like Rice to come in and be the new 6 is so we aren't in a position to extend Partey for additional years. Because I don't want him at the club, but recognize its not the club's position to be judge, jury, and executioner for these things. Meanwhile I've never seen a club terminate a contract based on claims that did not ultimately bring a conviction, doing so would be an interesting precedent to set though. 

The club also knows that partey isn't worth promoting, and doesn't emphasize him nearly as much as you would see for a player in his position and with his importance. He is our second highest earning player based on a contract signed before this happened. Looking through their twitter postings I'm trying to find the last time Partey was featured on anything outside of a team celebration picture. 

The closest thing I can find is a training photo posted on December 16th that Partey was the focus of. But he's never interviewed, never advertised for apparel or otherwise, and i can't find the last time he was the guy on the team sheet announcement image.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xqkc8,t1_j6xkx9z
"Feeling uncomfortable is completely reasonable.

To put it in a different light, Thomas himself may be guilty as sin or innocent as a babe in arms, and either way, *he* would feel uncomfortable about this situation as well. It's not a comfortable thing; what comforts there may be are generally cold.

For my part, I would simply like idiots to stop stating as facts things which are blatantly untrue.

edit: My favourite one so far isn't even the United fan who said Thomas 'had been found guilty', but the Chelsea fan who confidently stated that 'Occam's Razor' entailed that Thomas was 'likely a rapist'-- in the same breath he misstated not only the principle he had failed to understand and applied like an ape with a calculator, and which wasn't even William of Ockham's to begin with, but the facts of the situation.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xnq39,t1_j6xkx9z
"True. 

And the wildest things I see continuously is this unrepentant hunger for 'more solid evidence', deliberately ignoring the very sensitive nature of SA, and how it, by its very nature, tends to produce he-said-she-said situations in court. Partey's messages where he directly admitted to SA (>!where he admits to putting his penis in the victim's mouth whilst she was asleep !<), are probably not enough to indict him in court, especially considering his social and financial status, but the only thing that means is that the justice system is fundamentally broken.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xlyrg,t1_j6xkx9z
"Partey, as it currently stands, is innocent. So take your bullshit elsewhere.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xp5df,t1_j6xkx9z
"Nah I'm with you. I haven't forgotten and don't intend to anytime soon. These clubs can have their priorities, but I have mine. I still feel weird about Raheem Sterling, and his abuse case was over a decade ago.",Arsenal,Yes,j6y92yr,t1_j6xkx9z
"I mean if the way this sub treats Partey bothers you, there's no need to keep coming back.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xqlk9,t1_j6xkx9z

Weirdly there‚Äôs been more positive noise about saliba signing than saka. I normally wouldn‚Äôt be worried about saka and i would still fairly confidently say he‚Äôll sign but madrid and sort of man city (mahrez is getting older) having holes at RW makes me a little nervous.,Arsenal,Yes,j6ykwaj,t1_j6yjhnx

"Doesn't make any sense for either not to extend. Hopefully the next 3 years are amazing and they can live in London playing for one of the best teams in the world. Could play out a contract and still be 25. 

And even if somehow things go bad at Arsenal, both have the talent to go anywhere in the world with still a lot of their career in front of them.

"I have no doubt both will sign. Great city, stadium, fan atmosphere, squad cohesion, great support from team mates, coach and back room staff. Team willing to show ambition to sign players, there‚Äôs just too many positives.",Arsenal,Yes,j6yus8h,t1_j6yjhnx
"*""I get that. And it's not about owning anyone. But when you spend hours travelling for an interview, then spend time transcribing, writing, etc. It gets a tad frustrating when you just see it picked apart like that in a matter of minutes. But I know, that's just the way it is.""*

"I think the biggest hold up is that 300k a week. That would destroy our wage structure right after (hopefully) tying down Saka, Martinelli, and saliba. Potentially upsetting our starts as they look at this newcomer making more than them. 

Bellingham will want that 300k+ a week, I don‚Äôt doubt that, but I don‚Äôt see Arsenal being willing to pay that. 

If we win the league, and we go for him, I foresee us offering 200-250k and then someone else beating our contract. I would LOVE Bellingham, but I just don‚Äôt see the club matching the salary he would want/demand",Arsenal,Yes,j6xj6nw,t1_j6xil3j
"150m is more than double our all time record transfer. No way we‚Äôll be spending anywhere near that for any player, nor should we.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xj7se,t1_j6xil3j
"Not a good look for a new signing to come in and immediately become the club‚Äôs highest earner, resetting the wage structure. 

If all squad members who‚Äôve been giving every ounce of themselves for this project resign, only to make ¬£50-¬£100k/week less than a newly signed 19 year old, there stands to be some malcontent in the dressing room. If they sign Jude before extending key players, they‚Äôll immediately demand a bump in their compensation. 

I don‚Äôt think a > ¬£300k/week earner joins the squad, until √òdegaard gets an extension in the same neighborhood.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xjt8f,t1_j6xil3j
"Footballistically, Rice seems to fit like a glove in the side, whereas Bellingham would need a bit of adaptation and you lose a lot of his abilities if you play him as a 6. 

There's also more data on Rice than Bellingham, and less risk of adaptation issues (e.g. Sancho). Arteta/Edu have shown a strong preference for Premier league experience when it comes to expensive transfers. 

Last thing, financial outlay means money down now, not how much we recoup at the end of contract. We could potentially get a Rice and Caicedo/Zubamendi for the price of a Bellingham. And we need two players to replace Xhaka+Partey in the near future. 

Ideally we go for Rice AND Bellingham, but realistically Rice and one other is a more achievable target.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xkmwu,t1_j6xil3j
"I'd love Bellingham but can't help feel he's destined to join Real Madrid. On a quick glance, he'd fit there well as they are a counter attacking team that would give him a lot of freedom.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xk2xx,t1_j6xil3j
"Right now, unlike 2 years ago, we are able to do way better than Locatelli",Arsenal,Yes,j6xv4ol,t1_j6xuuf3

"They don't all have to play as strikers. That's the key part everyone is missing. Jesus can play LW and RW and Balogun can play off the left. Even Trossard can play as a striker. The players are interchangeable and can play multiple positions inside a single game, nevermind across different matches. Players will fluidly rotate and pop up randomly and the opposition won't know who to mark and where they're going to go, with runners from midfield able to go both inside and outside, goals from all over the park. How do you stop this?

That's the whole point. Organised chaos.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wfpli,t1_j6wf58k
We will not have enough games to split between them. Every top team itw who plays with one striker has two strikers in their squad.

"It's kinda weird people find it so hard to believe he did what he did. Like he hasn't been accused of being a violent rapist; the accusation is more that he just doesn't understand consent and tried to impose himself on someone who was sleeping. I mean...that's completely believable.

Our case looks bad because there are multiple cases but are there hard evidence?  
It‚Äôs hard. I hope the police does something about it, it certainly looks bad. But if they drop it for lack of evidence then it‚Äôs tough to say he did it.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xbfxe,t1_j6x8m1o
I'm gonna get downvoted to eternity but Partey's case isn't going anywhere. Heck even Greenwood is going to walk out scot-free legally. It doesn't matter if he did or didn't do it.

They could also pursue a mutual termination - which we have done a lot in the past few years - which he‚Äôd likely take if he wants to play football soon.

You also underestimate the implications of playing him. I can see boycotts, withdrawing of sponsorship etc. It‚Äôs not as easy as you may think to make the decision. The leaked videos and audio are pretty damning regardless of the conclusion of the criminal prosecution.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ynem2,t1_j6ymeq3

"Tierney: Maybe, but I think he sticks around for CL football

Turner: Nope. His US role isn't under any threat.

"Zero chance we sell partey or xhaka. No chance. We'd sooner sell jorginho.

Also not selling Turner. He's a perfect backup keeper and is an arsenal fan. He's happy we're happy.

I agree on Tierney. And holding. Elneny if someone wants him. We'll probably get 40-50m selling runarsson. Lokonga and nuno probably end up sold. Pepe will be sold if anyone wants him, I feel like it's more likely there that we just do a mutual termination though.",Arsenal,Yes,j6zo8yk,t1_j6zmo3x

If you think Nketiah has been playing as a penalty box striker you've not been paying close enough attention. his all round game is solid. Only big advantage I can really give Jesus is some of his central dribbling and final ball,Arsenal,Yes,j6w7g4t,t1_j6w6ut8
"At the beginning of the season Jesus was at a different level from everyone else.

Just was clearly performing above even Partey, Saka, Odegaard etc.

"This isn't really true.

Napoli have spent that price twice in recent years on a striker, and will again is Osimhen leaves. Higuain and Osimhen cost that much.

Atletico has spent that much (infl adjusted) on a striker like 7 times in recent times? (Aguero, Jackson Martinez, Felix, Costa, Falcao, Morata)

Lille will spend whatever Jonathon David goes for. It won't be 70, but 40 won't be an issue.

Red Bull have plenty of money.

Milan will have whatever money Leao is sold for.

Juventus have no problem with creative accounting.

And few people are saying 70m is nailed on, but they are every bit as good of a prospect as players going in that range. Plus they are not foreign/count as homegrown.

"> United are within their right or bring back Greenwood

ANy club is within their rights to play anyone.

However the club will have a code of conduct for all players and if what was released doesn't contravene that code of conduct then there's something severely wrong with it.

I doubt there is a company in the country that wouldn't sack someone for what he did and comparing it to Partey where there is no material evidence in the public domain is disingenous, there's no way the club wouldn't have doen exacly as United did if they'd seen that and I'd honestly see them dumping him as I'm pretty sure Man U will with Greenwood.",Arsenal,Yes,j6zwv4r,t1_j6zuuus

"Yeah they could have achieved more when they had a really good squad. But there are teams like Villa, Everton, West Ham etc.. who were similarly sized to them who never took that next step into the top 6 the way spurs have.

"This is a fair take.  
I am gutted we didn‚Äôt win the league with Ozil and Sanchez but we had some odd names to deal with.  
  
Looking at the amount of talent they had in their squad made me laugh hard, I had forgotten some of the big names.  
But Kane, Son and Lloris are getting past their prime soon.  
Lloris is not a superstar but he‚Äôs been consistently good.  
They‚Äôll struggle to replace any of them.  
  
That said, I am (unfortunately) a fan of Richarlison, I think he‚Äôll play well as a #9, he‚Äôs being wasted on the wing.  
Best thing they could hope for is if Kane breaks record and fucks off then Richarlison assumes the 9 role and plays well.  
If Kane stays they‚Äôll piss off Richarlison and struggle to find a replacement for Kane when he eventually leaves.",Arsenal,Yes,j6zt5ti,t1_j6zrjt6

Good point on big accounts though, probably better to avoid those even if they do provide news or other important info, a lot of people trying to cause a stir under those",Arsenal,Yes,j6xg37w,t1_j6xcimh

What do u mean mate? Like u think he might go to an inverted fullback role sometime in the future? If so yeah I ain't seen him play at all lol but he seems to have the right attributes based on what I hear. Do u think we still sign Ndicka on a free in the summer now we got this guy? Or is this guy a replacement for Holding and we get Ndicka anyway? I remember heating he wants insane wages + Barca are interested so perhaps we went for this guy instead?,Arsenal,Yes,j70ruoy,t1_j70hvij

"The fee won‚Äôt be peanuts, all of the top 6 teams will be interested",Arsenal,Yes,j6y82mn,t1_j6y7bcg

"We're not changing formations, and Rice both won't be ready to inherit Thomas' mantle as our 6, and won't come here to sit on the bench until he is.

Thomas continues as the 6; Rice starts as an 8 while offering improved 6 cover until he's ready to run with it.

Basically, think of Rice as 'Mega Sambi'.",Arsenal,Yes,j6yeyjk,t1_j6ydrkd
Partey stays at 6. For now. We won‚Äôt shift back to a double pivot unless we‚Äôre in an injury crisis though (IMO).,Arsenal,Yes,j6yefbp,t1_j6ydrkd

"Well the fans were convinced we nearly lost him, and undoubtedly relationships were strained, but the messaging from both sides was always reiterating their commitment to eachother",Arsenal,Yes,j6w8946,t1_j6w7ehw
"You're probably right. Tbh I think he could have been useful to us last season but he wouldn't have got as much game time, as Gabriel and White were the established CB pairing at the time.

"I know you would sign Vlahovic in a heartbeat or even Osimhen if given the chance even when we already have Jesus and Nketiah.

"Not to speak for op, but that's not at all the implication I took away.

"That‚Äôs exactly what he wants.

"He does left exposed in the past, everyone knows his limitations. But with our inverted FB especially our RB White pushing so high up , Jorgi can only retreat a few yards, that would create a 212 back line with him in middle. We will still be exposed with a long ball over the top catching everyone by surprise, but then it's not Jorgi's problem, the entire backline is at fault.",Arsenal,Yes,j6yi41t,t1_j6y7zm8
He‚Äôs definitely not shit but he has some obvious weaknesses and gets exposed in space from time to time. His qualities on the ball are still really good he will always show for it and has good press resistance you guys got a good one,Arsenal,Yes,j6y9qak,t1_j6y7zm8
Sergio Biscuits,Arsenal,Yes,j6w7r3r,t1_j6w7dqw
"Funniest thing was people thinking, we get Caicedo for 80 then we get Rice for 100, no probs. Then when i ask, what's the risk with signing Jorginho, they said that signing Jorginho will prevent us from signing Rice. Insane takes.",Arsenal,Yes,j6yc8aa,t1_j6yakyf
"Of course opinions are allowed to change, but it should be based on evidence. The fact people were screeching about him signing, then slowly walking that back and saying he's now a good signing - despite not playing for us yet, mind - means they were being unnecessarily reactionary. 

I saw people on here saying this was the worst window ever and Edu should be physically attacked for George signing for us. People need to get a grip.",Arsenal,Yes,j6yhkjv,t1_j6ybkli
Their opinions haven‚Äôt changed based on anything they‚Äôve seen on the pitch their opinions are changing because it‚Äôs popular to do so now and that‚Äôs all they care about. They were v happy to lead an dumbass agenda against Gaspar when it suited them to do so.,Arsenal,Yes,j6yck60,t1_j6ybkli

"I'd be fine with KT and Trossard starting but seeing how we play without Partey worries me, even with Jorginho in the squad. He needs to start every PL game if he's healthy IMO, give Jorginho a run in the EL and see how he fits",Arsenal,Yes,j6w6xlk,t1_j6w6pnp

"Playing everyone 270 minutes won't happen and is a recipe for disaster.

I found Edu's valuation of players quite reasonable so far. Rice is more valuable in the market than Caicedo or Mudryk so I doubt he does that,Arsenal,Yes,j6y1rkm,t1_j6y0e25
Except Rice is worth about double what Caicedo is so that‚Äôs a pretty unlikely scenario.,Arsenal,Yes,j6y208t,t1_j6y0e25
"5 of our first XI were priority Edu targets he got signed. A sixth came because he set a valuation and moved on (Zinchenko).

I'd say he's lost out on 4 guys we really went after: Vlahovic, Mudryk, Raphina, Lisandro Martinez. 2 of those came down to the player choosing Juve/Barca over us. 2 of them he got outbid. Can't even say we've lost out on Caicedo yet because he hasn't been sold.

Long way to go yet, but if we do it I'm gonna relish in the fact people spent their time criticizing transfers that didn't happen over being thrilled about this squad that's assembled.",Arsenal,Yes,j6y4xx7,t1_j6y0e25

Kompany has turned Burnley around into a possession team and I'm sure it's built on similar positional play principles.

I share being uncomfortable about him. And if he ends up innocent I'd have understood being uncomfortable with him at the time.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xm99t,t1_j6xlixx
if martin √∏degaard was a murderer but got away on a technicality would you still support him?,Arsenal,Yes,j6xpiie,t1_j6xlixx
"Saka is def gonna wait until the summer. If he wins us the title he‚Äôll get a huge contract. 

I really can‚Äôt see why Saka would want to leave for City. He‚Äôs at the club he loves and they have the foundation to compete for the biggest trophies. He‚Äôll sign in the summer when his value is highest. Could be something like ¬£300k",Arsenal,Yes,j6ymwbl,t1_j6ykwaj
"Yeah I‚Äôve noticed that as well. 

My hope is that it‚Äôs just sakas agent being a dick. He is notorious for it.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ys9m0,t1_j6ykwaj
"This is it. 

If Arsenal won the league this year, then competed in the CL for a year (securing it again in 24/25), gave √òdegaard a ¬£300k/week extension in Summer 2024, then they could pursue a high wage earner, like Jude or Frankie de Jong.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xk5bs,t1_j6xj6nw
Rumours they are back together and she refused to cooperate with the prosecution,Arsenal,Yes,j6x12zn,t1_j6x05fz
"Manchester Police investigated Greenwood, and recommended charges to CPS; CPS charged him; he had been set to go to trial on 27 November 2023.

What happened today was that CPS dropped the charges.

And from the slightly snippy tone of the Greater Manchester Police statement, they don't seem especially happy about it, and are quite keen to throw CPS under the bus for this.",Arsenal,Yes,j6x0zy7,t1_j6x05fz
Bold of you to assume any sporting organization has morals.  Marcus Alonso killed someone and had a very successful career afterwards.,Arsenal,Yes,j6x079z,t1_j6wza7u

"There are two so far as I know. Another was thrown out. 

And they all know each other and had sexual relations with Partey by the way.

Disgusting innit,Arsenal,Yes,j6wpar8,t1_j6wp3ts
I think they'll struggle as long as there are incompetent people in charge. Potter himself was good and Brighton is well run. This is crucial,Arsenal,Yes,j6wqa30,t1_j6wpj66
"English club sure. 

He‚Äôll play in Europe though. Maybe not at a mega club but there are definitely clubs who will play him. 

Failing that the Middle East or Asia for sure he‚Äôd play.",Arsenal,Yes,j6yrepu,t1_j6ymzue
And the justice system having a bar so high for rape even with recording on the matter. It's a combination of various things which makes the official ruling pointless.,Arsenal,Yes,j6x4iqn,t1_j6x3cic
Yeah man I feel like he was playing kinda deeper for us than he would do now as an 8? If the numbers made sense I'd have him back on a free for sure would be a great player to have in the squad. Just ain't sure we could get the numbers to suit us tho,Arsenal,Yes,j70efpf,t1_j703gao
Why not mate?,Arsenal,Yes,j70ex6k,t1_j701k3s
Why‚Äôs Reims tactical set up stupid?,Arsenal,Yes,j6w746r,t1_j6w6qtw
"Decision making isn't just computed for if you shoot or pass in front of the goal, and even then Odegaard hasn't let his passing instead of shooting habit surface this year.

Decision making is a strenuous process that is evaluated everytime a player has ball at his feet. Every pass they pick, the tempo they play at, it's all decision making. And nobody in our team has decision making as good as him (since Ozil in fact).

If there was an A+, he'd be A+. 

It's pretty much his strongest suit. He wouldn't be half the conductor he is, without spatial understanding followed up by elite decision making.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wdmq7,t1_j6w7z4o
How can you possibly tell it's Partey lol,Arsenal,Yes,j6xczdu,t1_j6xc44k
A little ironic coming from arsenal fans no?,Arsenal,Yes,j70aa6f,t1_j707r8f
"I'd like to say that but there are enough chairmen willing to take the risk to get a player who should be beyond their reach.

"You‚Äôd hope so but..he‚Äôs a 21 year old player who was valued at over 50m before this. Remember, he has 0 criminal charges right now

I hate it but someone will seriously risk their reputation",Arsenal,Yes,j705o14,t1_j7040xt
"Oh, he'll play. My suspicion is he goes out to a foreign league, balls out for a while, then comes back to a UEL-level side to test the waters, then goes back to a top team.

Lack of nuance from OP is jarring,Arsenal,Yes,j6x80m5,t1_j6x69yb
"What makes me laugh is that grown ass adults do not know how easy it is to fabricate text messages these days and that with the right app even a 13-year-old can do it in five seconds.

Wait. What ?!?!",Arsenal,Yes,j6zonn4,t1_j6zo8yk
It's a hyperbole but the amount of people saying we need to sign a top cf becaude Eddie might get injured would mean we had 3 for one spot when all fit.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w5d2a,t1_j6w56bw
Eddie played wide for development not because he‚Äôs actually any good there.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w64yb,t1_j6w5ig8

We want you to perform well in UCL. It‚Äôs not always about winning. It‚Äôs about playing with a style and competing. Arsenal is the only club I respect in pl because they always chose a manager who would play with a style rather than just winning (read Chelsea).,Arsenal,Yes,j6wo3dk,t1_j6wnx4h
Why bro?,Arsenal,Yes,j6wnlo7,t1_j6wniue
No way? Right ?,Arsenal,Yes,j6xw3mf,t1_j6xvp48

I have. The transfer record outside of the top 6 + Newcastle is like 50m.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w4syx,t1_j6w4l50
"The most likely source of someone spending big money for Balogun would be what happens every summer.

A team has a player that wants to leave, then spends a similar amount on a replacement.

It's how Napoli went from Cavani to searching, then Higauin to Osimhen.

It's how Atletico has swapped strikers like 7x in 15 years.

A team gets in 50-80m, then the teams bargaining with them know that's what they have to spend. It just happened to us in a similar fashion.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w52lm,t1_j6w4l50
"He would only have 1 year on his contract after that supposed Palace loan, no chance the club loans him out in that scenario, and getting him to sign an extension would be close to impossible if you loan him out again after the outrageous season he's currently having. He's better than a loan right now",Arsenal,Yes,j6w50xs,t1_j6w4nhi
"If he chooses the US, could actually see PSG going for it for the marketing.

Don't forget they have Jordan branded kits rather than just plain Nike.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w53vv,t1_j6w4nhi
Jesus is #1 in Arteta's eyes he is going nowhere. He is also important for the mentality and culture around the dressing room,Arsenal,Yes,j6w5c63,t1_j6w51ps
"Amazing how we've gone from 'we're fucked without Jesus' to this in the space of about a month and a half.

Balogun is looking good, he's nowhere near the finished article to be deciding to bin our most transformational player of the season.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w5p6h,t1_j6w51ps
"Tapsoba also LCB, but could be RCB here, as he‚Äôs right-footed. 

Never had a RCB target with Saliba in the fold.",Arsenal,Yes,j6y7vou,t1_j6y7eoo
"Yes because she was basically pressured by her dad and Greenwood who basically broke the law and got in touch with her. Even if this case is different, the statistic still show it is a huge problem in general when it comes to rape charges. For example Sweden had a new law implemented that made a gigantic jump in the way sexual charges are seen. It should 100% be seen as an issue",Arsenal,Yes,j6xj6ph,t1_j6xi4zx

yup that's what I read into those texts.  silver lining part was where she said no and he left her alone to sleep and he went somewhere else.,Arsenal,Yes,j6z985h,t1_j6z8q4r
Yeah lol @ that united guy trying to compare the two. there is alot of doubt and uncertainly around Thomas's case but with Greenwood it was all out there.,Arsenal,Yes,j6zwuu3,t1_j6zw9xu

Club didn‚Äôt do it but rices family did.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wys0k,t1_j6wvnxy
All the major news outlets simultaneously reported that Rice was our target 2 weeks ago. That was almost certainly a deliberate leak by the club.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wwav3,t1_j6wvnxy

">  Saka was a class A academy player 

Not at all. Saka was so highly rated that he was given his debut at 17. Unless you are talking of the time when he was under 15, then I have no idea.",Arsenal,Yes,j6weprs,t1_j6wdujl
"In ultra-running the last-man standing format  to win you must complete one more lap than the 2nd to last person. If the last two fail to complete at the same lap then both are out and it‚Äôs considered to have no winners.

"I don't think Rice will go for ¬£80ish millions. No chance. Not if one of Man City, Liverpool, Chelsea or Man Utd are in for him. He is a prem proven, young, versatile and a regular england national team starter.

I've been an arsenal fan for a little over twenty years, winning league titles and being a regular in the UCL and I've never seen us be comfortably able to cover the expenses of someone our rivals want too. I'd love to see us going all in on him, but I'm afraid that's not how we operate. Tielemans or Zubimendi might be more realistic options since Barca is broke.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wf5nc,t1_j6wcibs
"If one of them is willing to ride the bench then I'd love a competetive situation like that. We don't need to pick now, I'm just stating what I currently think about it. We've got 7 months to make a decision. I'm just having a feeling we need to sell players for a total of ¬£50-¬£70m to afford Rice. We can keep all the strikers if we go for Zubimendi instead.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wfk2y,t1_j6wcsjf
"He does seem like one who puts his football first. I'm not certain if he feels that way if Man City miss out on Jude, send an ¬£100m offer to West Ham and a four year and ¬£380k/week offer to Declan to play for Pep. I'd take it if I was Declan/West ham to be honest if we go ¬£85m and ¬£220k/week. Our board has already stated we don't go for bidding wars.

I'm already prepared for Zubimendi. I rate him quite highly and he fits better to our transfer strategy too.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wg4c1,t1_j6wcuyf
"Jude will be hotter, but yeah, we're going to have to go all out for Rice.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wekcb,t1_j6wcuyf

"also people forget jesus and eddie sub each other often to maintain stamina, also since we have no saka backup before trossard we can now rotate martinelli saka trossard jesus on the wing comfortably instead of pushing injured saka to keep playing",Arsenal,Yes,j6wgvl3,t1_j6wel41

"100%, when things aren‚Äôt going right easy to think this one change can save you.

You‚Äôre probably right that fatigue played a large part in that performance. But I also think the way Leeds set up against us was quite impressive and we would have struggled in any case. The problem is that it requires serious levels of intensity which most teams cannot produce consistently.,Arsenal,Yes,j6y71nn,t1_j6y6foa
i agree. leeds were relentless with the press. they played very well.,Arsenal,Yes,j6yvjg2,t1_j6y6oh9
I think Jesus just wants to play. I don‚Äôt think he cares all that much about whether he‚Äôs on the wing or a striker. He seems to have the mentality of ‚ÄúI just want to help the team‚Äù.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wduvp,t1_j6wavd0

">  I think they are frustrated mainly because of our success this season so far and it‚Äôs boiled over.

I think that's definitely a major part and I've seen a few admit it but we really can only take credit for removing the best argument that ENIC had left which was that they were doing better than us.

Now their fans are feeling an end of an era coming on and the beginning of a new one for Arsenal they're looking back at this period of 'success' and seeing that they ahve absolutely fuck all to show for it",Arsenal,Yes,j6zudm1,t1_j6zts8w

"I mean Lloris has a European and World Cup winners medal, he's maybe never been truly world class but until recently he's definitely been at the top of whatever level comes underneath that.

Son, Kane, Bale, Lloris, Modric and in the Bale sale they had their Anelka/Coutinho moment where the cash was there to do something incredible and they absolutely fucked it.

I've only seen Richarlison play up front for Brazil and he's just not going to get that kind of service at Spurs, it's a scary thought just what Kane might be able to do in a team that's actually creative...",Arsenal,Yes,j6zv2ft,t1_j6zt5ti
They were dreadful for all of 2019 with Pochettino. He seemed defeated and was giving disheartening press conferences suggesting he‚Äôd walk from spurs at any time. I think they were right to sack him.,Arsenal,Yes,j6ztko4,t1_j6zrcmi
Agreed. One bad season and they pulled the plug. Disgraceful. Almost as bad but not quite as bad was firing quite possibly the greatest cup competition manager ever right before a final.,Arsenal,Yes,j6zrezd,t1_j6zrcmi

The evidence against him is just as damming (not as damming as Greenwood I will admit).

"> I took the point to be that here we have a clear example of a case where a horrible act will not be punished with a conviction.

To be clear, literally no-one here is questioning that Greenwood did 'a horrible act'.

That said, conviction is not punishment; conviction is the result of the process of trial which *allows* punishment-- to the extent that the criminal system is intended to be punitive, which is debatable.

> There are many such cases, especially with domestic violence and sexual assault.

Yes, that is also true; the conviction rates in those cases are shockingly low.

But, in this case, with Greenwood, *why* is that not happening?

Victim agency.

"I don't think it's a matter of him not being good enough, it's a case of continuing his progression and making sure he gets consistent minutes to aid his development.

Agree to disagree then. I much prefer Jesus on the wing to Eddie but I still think he's above Balogun in that role.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wq9l4,t1_j6wn77k

">Are you sure Balo is ready to play PL or CL? 

Not at all I'll let Arteta make that decision when he assesses him during preseason, but if he is then he must remain in the squad. If he isn't then by all means loan him out.

There is more evidence for people to deem Greenwood guilty than the other way round.,Arsenal,Yes,j6y47p1,t1_j6xwb3e

And no that isn‚Äôt material evidence. Text messages stripped of context if they are even real aren‚Äôt material evidence. 

You would need to know the entire context and circumstances in whcih that was said and again I‚Äôll repeat this is someone he had a relationship with.

"My ‚Äòexpert opinion‚Äô is that not guilty does not mean innocent. My human opinion is that I don‚Äôt give a shit what 12 jurors or some twats in the CPS say. I have eyes and ears and (thanks to my parents and whatever divine being is out there) a good head on my shoulders. I saw and listened and concluded that MG and TP are disgusting rapists. I would say the same if it was a footballer at my club in the exact same situations. 

Really and truly, there is a very small minority of alleged rapists that get sent down and that isn‚Äôt because they didn‚Äôt rape their alleged victims, but because it is an extremely difficult thing to prosecute and the police force is a bag of shite. But that does not mean that they are ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù. This is when we, as humans, have to look at a scenario and the facts available to us and make our own judgments. 

There is also the idea of Occam‚Äôs Razor - the idea that requires the fewest assumptions is the correct one. None of this deepfake, photoshop nonsense - if a guy is accused by three women on two different continents of rape and one of those charges was only dropped due to legislation, he is likely a rapist. If another guy is on tape raping his girlfriend or his girlfriend has multiple images of her bruised and bleeding, he is likely a rapist that has been beating her.

I don‚Äôt agree that we look ‚Äúdisjointed on the left‚Äù. Zinchenko and Xhaka have been amazing as ever, and Martinelli is simply having a slight dip in form. 

Nketiah‚Äôs touches are not really low for a CF, and he‚Äôs really not just a poacher anymore. This is exactly my point. Just because he isn‚Äôt Jesus doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs simply a poacher or isn‚Äôt a good fit for our system. He fits our system very well actually, because he is a serious goal threat and has elite movement, so will score a ton of goals in our highly creative system, and create space for our wingers to score. Plus he is able to drop deep and link up play to a very high standard. The stats back this up. He doesn‚Äôt just stay close to goal. That is not what happens if you watch our games, nor is that what is shown by the stats. That is exactly why we have generated *more* xG per game since he‚Äôs been starting.

I don't care whether I like someone or not. If he actually did it, let him rot in jail. That's actual justice.

While both still have good football ahead of them, they‚Äôre on the back end of their careers. They are blocking the youth from playing and developing today, and will be a strain on the balance sheet tomorrow. 

Keppa is owed ¬£7.8m/year for 2 seasons, and while Mendy is only making ¬£6m total over those two years, the club still needs to buy and pay another top keeper. 

You have high earners - (1 year) Auba, Azpilicueta, Baba Rahman, Hudson-Odoi, Kovacic, Loftus-Cheek, Pulisic, (2 years) Ziyech, Sarr - who‚Äôs futures need to be sorted.

If they fail to secure top 4, they‚Äôre set to lose significant revenue, while accruing the cumulative amortization expense for recent transfers (likely including deals that predate Boehly).

Amortisation has nothing to do with payment structure of deal, it's just how the value of players is registered in accounting.

1) The transfer fee is spread through the length of the contract so an 80m signing on an 8 year contract will count as 10m per year towards expenditure. FFP is on a three year rolling average I believe, so you'd only see this signing contributing 30m maximum towards FFP cap (for an extended period of course).

2) Player sale profits are registered the year they were sold. If we sell an academy player for 30 mill, that goes a long way in increasing FFP in the next few years. As shown, it would create the leeway for an 80m signing on an 8 year contract. 

The disclaimer being that you'd have to make another 30m profit from player sales up to four years later and a smaller amount after that and so on. UEFA are also closing the 8 year contract loophole for the summer, player sale profits still prove valuable though as 5 year contracts stretch beyond 3 year rolling average.

3) Selling a player midway through amortisation brings forward the rest of the transfer fee to that year [in the accounts]. If unnamed club sells unnamed 80m player, midway through their 8 year contract, then 40m will be deducted from the player profits. This could even turn the sale into a net loss on their accounts that year. 

If a club wants to boost their FFP cap, they'd want to sell academy players, players they signed for free or cheaply, or valuable players nearing the end of their contract.

4) What does this mean for our unnamed club, *cough* Chelsea? On one side, as long as they keep getting tasty profits on their academy players every 2-3 years, they can maintain a high FFP cap. Sales of players approaching end of contract are also a nice boon. 

However, there's still a lot of risk with how they've conducted themselves. They've bought 15 players in the year 2022/2023. A good chunk of them on high fees and long contracts. For their most expensive signings, they have to put a lot of faith in these players because selling them early in their contract could very easily cause a net loss in their accounts. The 8 year contracts worsens this.

The next couple years are crucial for them. If they don't bounce back, in terms of results, I can see a situation where clubs no longer want their deadwood - a bloated squad with high wages + amortized fees will limit them in the market severely. If their marquee signings flop and force an early move, or if their academy conveyor belt stops paying dividends, they could find themselves in shit. As I've shown, these things have a more pronounced effect on FFP.

P.s. I'm not an accountant and have done limited reading so I may have got some details wrong.

A last final FFP fact: the buyout clauses set on every Spanish+Portuguese contract cannot be amortised (whole fee registered in that years accounts) and also incur extra taxes. This is because the club is technically paying the lump sum to the player (incurring income tax) to buyout his own contract, who is then signed on a free afterwards. We bought Partey this way; Enzo's deal was negotiated to avoid this; Zubimendi has 55mill buyout this summer. Well done if you read this far.",Arsenal,No,j6ri0rj,t3_10qnzmb

"Come to think of it, it does take a sensible head to separate all the optics of this transfer (which are horrible at first glance) from the actual player, who he is and how he fits. 

- Chelsea player
- Old(er)
- Slow
- Us seemingly helping them with FFP
- Missing out on targets previously this window which Chelsea got instead
- Them potentially getting Caicedo and us getting Jorginho if Enzo deal collapsed
- Missing out on a midfield target in consecutive windows


All of the above is quite maddening if you only focus on that. 

But if you look deeper these don't really matter.

- Point 1 - Doesn't matter
- Point 2 - Short contract so doesn't matter.
- Point 3 - Yes but we are a compact team and he has faster players around him.
- Point 4 - Irrelevant for our title charge.
- Point 5 - This stings and maybe some questions could be asked but doesn't have much to do with Jorginho if we couldn't sign those players.
- Point 6 - Again, out of our control, if Brighton only sell Caicedo for a crazy 100 million fee then we are not paying that.
- Point 7 - Yes but we are still top and have got a replacement for El-Neny in.


Then there are the positives of how Jorginho is liked by Arteta and his experience and winning mentality for the squad. How he is an upgrade on El-Neny and Lokonga. I commented that El-Neny is better defensively than Jorginho but upon reflection that's not entirely true, El-Neny is better maybe at aerial duels and running back and tracking but Jorginho is much better in forward defensive actions so there's some tradeoff, on the ball they are completely different levels.

"Looking at our squad now there aren't any complete weaknesses/missing cover. Think we still have some needs at CB, RW, and LCM (or general youth in the midfield). We'll likely look to re-enforce those spots in the summer, but short term we have players that can play in all of those spots. 

At CB Kiwior is just an unknown and Holding has his limitations. But we have White and Tomi who can slide in as needed.

RW there is no out and out backup but Trossard, Jesus, Vieira, and ESR can/have all played there. There are plenty of options. Feel like we'll end up with a very Pep/City like 3 for 2 spots with all of Trossard, Saka, and Martinelli playing equal-ish minutes. 

It's similar at LCM. There isn't really a like for like replacement for Xhaka. But we can play 2 attacking 8s with ESR or Vieira there. Or maybe even see some 4231 with Jorginho and Partey if there is a longer term issue. I'm actually really excited to see ESR in likely more midfield roles. 

Overall, while we didn't get our top 2 targets, I feel like we really set ourselves up for a solid run to end the season in the window.

For starters, we need to stop seeing Jorginho and Xhaka as the potential midfield setup. You're still thinking in the Wenger/Emery/early Arteta double pivot setups, which isn't the plan anymore. For all intents and purposes, Jorginho's midfield partners will be Zinchenko and White. He won't be playing in a pivot, but more a fluid pivot-trivote that shifts around in buildup depending on White's positioning, with Xhaka and Odegaard positioning themselves more as pseudo-forwards.

This actually suits Jorginho - at Chelsea, some of his best form came when he wasn't exposed as the lone pivot, but instead put into a double pivot in a 3-4-2-1. They build up with a similar 5-5 block to us, where the wingbacks play a similar role to our wingers by staying high and wide to pull open defensive shapes, and alternate between each other to provide goalscoring options on the far side. While their shape is more a 3-2 in buildup rather than 2-3, ours can shift between both depending on where White moves. 

Our system - as well as that 3-4-3/3-4-2-1 popularized in the EPL by Conte - also heavily focuses upon guarding against counterattacks by ensuring there's always a solid defensive block of 5. So when people worry about 'how will Jorginho defend', they're not considering how the new system is meant to work. Alone, he won't be good enough. But he's not defending alone, he's defending with 4 others to restrict space into dangerous zones for onrushing attackers. This is where his ability to intercept, and then move the ball forward calmly is so so good, more than you believe. He doesn't need to win a leg race and then do a proper English tackle, Terry Butcher-style. The team just needs to shepherd attackers into dead ends, pick the ball off them, then efficiently recycle the ball to continue killing the opposition with a thousand cuts.

Jorginho is more than good enough for that setup.",Arsenal,No,j6rl6t7,t3_10qnzmb

"A point of comparison I've not seem put up yet is last January, which is perhaps surprisingly revealing.

A year ago, we went in hard for Vlahovic, missed, and signed no-one instead. This window, we went for Mudryk, missed-- and signed Trossard to add depth to our attack. Ultimately, even if you were happy with Eddie's performance -- and he's only gone from strength to strength since -- and remain skeptical about Trsosard or disappointed about missing on Mudryk (and/or Raphinha), surely that's a better result from the window.

As reported by Ornstein after the fact, we also made a move for Schlotterbeck a year ago, and again missed. A week ago, we signed Kiwior from Spezia. Gabriel now has a direct backup.

Ornstein also reported that we made a move for Arthur-- and that, contrary to bizarrely popular belief, this deal did not break down over Juve's loan terms: to which both Edu and Arteta agreed, and with which they wanted to proceed. Instead, as reported, it broke down when Edu presented their deal to the club 'hierarcy' (Ornstein's word) who refused it. In short, Edu and Arteta wanted Arthur on an 18 month loan with a ‚Ç¨40m option.

This time around, we got Jorginho on an 18 month contract (+1 option) for ¬£10+2m.

While there have been some truly insane overratings of Jorginho on here -- my favourite being the Chelsea superfan who insisted Jorginho would not backup but immediately replace Thomas -- surely the sheer horror expressed over the prospect of Arthur should warm the less credulous a little to Jorginho.

My own view is that we should give Arteta whoever he wants, and Edu whatever he needs to do that; I can even see why they wanted Arthur as an 8, though the need for Jorginho's cover as a 6 is a lot more intense.",Arsenal,No,j6rqlm6,t3_10qnzmb
Still surprised at some of the comments on the Jorginho signing.  It‚Äôs a short term january signing to add experienced depth at a key position.  Didn‚Äôt break the bank and allows us to stay on course for our summer transfer plans,Arsenal,No,j6rsrld,t3_10qnzmb

"Even as someone who has repeatedly called Jorginho overrated (was scandalised by his inclusion in the Ballon D'Or top three) and generally dislikes him as a player, I'd have to admit there's a lot of things to like about this deal:

1. Lack of adjustment time: Can't think of a player (other than Busquets) with more coaching as a number 6 in a posession-oriented team, both in terms of passing and defensive awarenesss. Should in theory mean he can slot into our team (either replacing an injured Partey or in our second XI) without needing much time to gel.

2. Weaknesses mitigated: His most significant weakness (though he has others) is a difficulty depending large spaces, due to his poor athleticism and lack of agility. However, thanks to our highly compact system and the physically dominant players around him, we should be okay. For example, even though Partey is extremely athletic (remember him playing RB against us for Atletico), he seldom has to use his burst of pace - that run to track Anthony last week was an exception, rather than the norm. My only concern in this respect is that Jorginho will be less protected if he gets minutes in our second XI (e.g., with ESR and Vieira in midfield rather than Xhaka and Ode), but I'm sure Arteta will pick a team keeping this in mind. 

3. Not injury prone/added recovery time: Despite playing a high volume of games for Chelsea in recent years, he's managed to stay clear of injury. In fact, one of the biggest criticisms has been that he's lost his legs a bit, which hopefully should be less of a problem if he's a backup player rather than a starter. We saw this a bit with Ronaldo last season: he's obviously not close to the physical specimen he was, but could still look somewhere close to his old self when he'd had a week or more off between games. 

4. Complements our team well from a temperament standpoint: Our team, as a whole, tends to be too aggressive at times when we're in the lead - trying to push too hard to manufacture another goal, often ceding possession and then territory as a result. It's weird, because most teams fall into the trap of being too direct when they're chasing a win, rather than maintaining one - we're actually incredibly patient in the former context. Jorginho should be a good foil for this. I can see Arteta bringing him on for Xhaka/Partey when we're leading, and instructing him to just retain the ball as much as possible with safe passes. 'Kill the game with 3000 passes' and all that. 

5. Doesn't clog up resources: Going for a higher-ceiling but more expensive option (say, Bamba or Edson Alvarez) would run the risk of being a waste of money, and possibly preventing us from buying a genuinely world-class player in that position. Bit similar to going for Trossard over a 50-60 million player when we lost Mudryk - the option of a long-term top-drawer DM (or in Trossard's case, winger) stays alive, and we don't have to rush into a subobtimal January move. Particularly true since Jorginho's contract is so short-term. 

6. Experience, leadership etc: Our players have spoken about how important the mental boost provided by Jesus and Zinchenko was. I have no idea if Jorginho will have a similar effect, but he should in theory, given that he's played in  and won high-pressure tournaments before. Could be important in the run in. 

7. European suitability: Given that a lot of his games as a starter (provided Partey remains fit) will come in Europe, his lack of athleticism and physicality should also not be exposed quite as much as it sometimes is in the Prem. That's also the stage he's shone most historically - UCL, Europa, Euros (similarly low intensity). 

There's obviously downsides - one being that he can only really deputise for Partey (unlike Caicedo, who could fill in as a 6 or an 8) - but a 1.5 year deal at 10-12 million could very well prove to be smart business. Like I said, I've had a longstanding dislike for Jorginho (that 2-1 loss at the Emirates when he scored the equaliser after avoiding being sent off still annoys me), but I reckon this makes sense if our number one targets weren't achievable.",Arsenal,No,j6rnk6i,t3_10qnzmb

Even when we didn't get Mudryk or Caicedo we could've gone for Diaby and Bamba but that would've been a panic move instead we got players with experience and considerably less price.

like the first galactico era of real madrid was broadly a failure with only some initial success because of a lack of competition ‚Äì it was a world very shy of 8 figure transfer fees. the more expensive stars they recruited into their team the less success they yielded until you end up in 2006 with henry embarrassing the entire madrid midfield and defence and they retool their approach to squadbuilding

and chelsea just did a mix of nottingham forest shopping spree with a youth galactico strategy (not even a genuine galactico strategy) and there's every chance it doesn't amount to much despite the expectation. because at the end of the day, it's them just chasing hype and trying to speedrun a rebuild without consideration for locker room dynamics and other human factors that make teams mesh or not, that draws good performances out of players, or not. like it smacks of like.. a fifa rebuild challenge. youtube ass team

By expected points, they are behind West Ham and .3 of a point above Aston Villa. That's their level of performances this season.

I know Felix is fun in FIFA. Mudryk and Enzo might get to the top, but this year? Potter doesn't know his best XI and this won't happen overnight. 

If we could use any Chelsea players for our match vs City, people here would probably take James to start. And that's it!

"Think some here are severely understating that it's not only the defensive prowess that Partey possesses that is lost without him, but moreso his technical and physical ability. Jorginho has never had the ability to turn on a dime under pressure and drive forward 20 yards to open up space like Partey can. Just this alone could affect how our fullbacks and advanced 8s operate during transition sequences. It could create undue pressure on these exterior units that have worked so well in the system (LB-LCM-LW and opp.) in not only how/where they defend but carrying play forward. 

You can say that the way we play will keep him on the ball more often than not, and if the play is in front of him everything should run smoothly, but that possessional security is predicated only on the most optimal scenarios. We don't just dominate games 100% over the full 90 minutes. Instances of being put under pressure don't just happen once per opponent, multiple have and will happen over the course of a match. A ball will inevitably be flying over his head and at some point his role and ability defensively as the lone 6 would be put to the test. 

Things would have to adjust in some ways ***if*** he is required to play the bulk of a PL 90' there, it's not just a plug and play, set and forget. Any top half team worth their salt would be looking to readjust their aggression and tenacity regarding midfield battles if they knew before the team sheets were announced it would be Jorginho instead of Partey there. 

We'll be fine, it's just the immediate concern that floods the mind. Regardless, the top objective concerning Jorg should be helping get the EL squad closer to something resembling the first team, which I believe he can do. But the early March EL fixture will also likely be the first instance of a Xhaka+Jorginho(+Vieira) midfield that would showcase what 2/3 of our worst case, Partey-less midfield could look like.",Arsenal,No,j6rkrzt,t3_10qnzmb

"Has Potter ever developed or worked with top level attacking talent?

The three big moves from Brighton have been White, Cucurella, and Bissouma.  Only one of those has really been outstanding in a new club so far.

Not to drag Potter, but it is kind of weird that a central aspect of Chelsea's current strategy appears to be that Potter will take and develop a collection of younger players into world beaters.  Arsenal took a similar bet, but Arteta at least had Sane and Sterling singing his praises - there was more reason to believe he would be the right guy for Martinelli and Saka.

January 2023 we spend our time chasing Mudryk and only decide we should get a midfielder once that doesn't work out and Elneny's injury is determined to be season ending. Chasing a player who wasn't going to be sold only to end up with a bit of a panic stop gap.

Many are influenced by what chelsea are doing. It makes no sense because our way of doing things has been working fine and this is a january window where no one really spends too much,Arsenal,Yes,j6r86mh,t1_j6r7og0
"I've got one.

We spent too long on Caicedo despite being told it wasn't going anywhere and were left to scrounge around a bit on deadline day",Arsenal,Yes,j6r7yg2,t1_j6r7og0
"Dont care about any relationships.

Those mugs will be giving us the guard of honor when we play them next.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r8wnu,t1_j6r7gml
"Fuck Brighton, if they truly are that upset about a second bid then they can fuck off. We'll go for zubimendi instead in the summer",Arsenal,Yes,j6r809b,t1_j6r7gml
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. The different look between the 2 is also a nightmare for defenders.,Arsenal,Yes,j6s4b0y,t1_j6s3ofd
"He‚Äôs definitely fighting with Eddie for 2nd choice striker. Not a knock on Eddie, but that‚Äôs how he will approach the preseason, and Arteta will award him if he earns it. I do expect a loan to a team in the Premiership next year.",Arsenal,Yes,j6th8h4,t1_j6tgfnx
Think loaning him to Everton next season ala Lakaka is a good move if Teta thinks hes still needs experience.,Arsenal,Yes,j6uthcp,t1_j6upwsa
Why would he want to go on another loan lol,Arsenal,Yes,j6uq4an,t1_j6upwsa
Is anyone saying 30M is a good price?,Arsenal,Yes,j6vwtz3,t1_j6vwpmj
"The contract length tells us that the club sees him as a title-winning depth signing and nothing more. He will be 32 by June 2024. I feel icky about giving Chelsea money but eh. We do what we must.

This summer there‚Äôs no excuse for missing out on a marquee midfielder though, whether it‚Äôs Rice or Caicedo.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rahfc,t1_j6r9o7a
"City would do well to win 5 games in a row at the moment. They are a clear level below what they have been for the past 4-5 years. If it wasn't for some really dodgy decisions, they would be further behind.

Love how the media have brushed off the fact that we (who apparently have no depth) made 6 changes against them away in the cup whilst they only changed their GK and we arguably were the better side. The first half especially, City couldn't cope with our six man press in their final third. Really only Liverpool have done that to City under Pep.

If City don't improve and fast, we could genuinely rip them apart with our first team at the Emirates this month.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rrjtx,t1_j6rrb9x
"Agreed. Watching us is like watching those city and Liverpool sides at their peak.
For many people they are the two best sides any one has seen in English football and we look as good as them.
It‚Äôs an incredible turnaround",Arsenal,Yes,j6ru7gr,t1_j6rrb9x
"this one not necessarily, but that process doesn't bode well long term. it's annoying this scatter brain approach has got them mudryk and enzo",Arsenal,Yes,j6t9muu,t1_j6t7z1f
"If you are new to football and have willingly decided to support Chelsea, you'd have to be a shameless weirdo.",Arsenal,Yes,j6u4ksd,t1_j6u3olx
"Pretty much sums up Chelsea. They're not even so much happy about the signings as they are about how much people dislike them for it. 

Just a weird weird club.",Arsenal,Yes,j6u78n5,t1_j6u3olx
"It's the types of people who were attracted to them in the first place.

That's just the kind of club they are. They attract that FIFA kiddie type who only wants shiny new things.

I would be amazed if most of them even watched their games.",Arsenal,Yes,j6u6c4h,t1_j6u3olx
"What else should they be happy about, being in 10th and playing like shit?",Arsenal,Yes,j6u4oe0,t1_j6u3olx
I‚Äôve never prayed for a player to flop more,Arsenal,Yes,j6r80ku,t1_j6r7huz
"Chelsea currently seem like a very bad place for a young player to really shine but Andrey santos is a very good player. He was by far one of the best players in the 2nd tier of brazilian football and was a standout perforner, Vasco Da Gama do produce some very solid talent and are a pretty big club.",Arsenal,Yes,j6s2nsl,t1_j6s1d6h
Told you he was a bargain.,Arsenal,Yes,j6t5umb,t1_j6t5jdq
It certainly was.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tescp,t1_j6ted72
"Rice & Caicedo are still 100% easily doable in the summer too, perhaps a winger too if we deem we need one. It‚Äôs looking good brev",Arsenal,Yes,j6rpk90,t1_j6rpeip
"Makes sense. Apparently he's tried to sign him for Arsenal many times and City wanted him when he was at Napoli and Arteta was assistant manager.

There's also that video of him talking about the 6 position and he mentions Busquets and Jorginho in the same bracket.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rs7tg,t1_j6rs1rm
"They are just the club getting unlucky this year. They are 10 goals below their xG. Antonio, Scamacca and Bowen couldn't score this year if the goals were 10 feet high.

They have the 5th best defense in the PL by expected goals.

Basically this year Fulham have been *incredibly luckY* with their results and West Ham unlucky. A more fair table would flip those teams, but luck is part of the game.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sss2m,t1_j6squpc
"They were heavily reliant on goals from Mr Dani Dyer and he's just stopped scoring, they bought players up front who got injured and Moyes doesn't seem to have been able to make up for it.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ss3sn,t1_j6squpc
"This is the new production of *Henry V* I always wanted.

'Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst, and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better.'",Arsenal,Yes,j6tg0ie,t1_j6tfn7p
"Because what City does is almost impossible to do, and even then it doesn‚Äôt work out that well for them. Sane, Sterling, Jesus, Zinchenko, Cancelo all leaving in recent years. It is going to be literally impossible to keep 3 high level strikers happy when you‚Äôre playing a formation with only one striker.",Arsenal,Yes,j6un29c,t1_j6uliwv
I would hope all the loaned out players look back at Arsenal and desire to come back and play. Want to see everyone working towards a spot. Very possible if we win this damn thing.  Last thing I‚Äôd want to see if a very public display of wanting to leave,Arsenal,Yes,j6vkki2,t1_j6vk6si
We sold Bennacer and we couldve bought him back and played him here tho prolly he chose to play in Milan for gametime.,Arsenal,Yes,j6vl8v8,t1_j6vk6si
He‚Äôs not going to be the new Kane lol,Arsenal,Yes,j6vtyw5,t1_j6vk6si
"ESR's return will be huge for us.

As is Martinelli's extension.",Arsenal,Yes,j6s2kth,t1_j6rxyyd
"The funny thing is, who the club actually recruited are better equipped to help secure this title charge than both ‚Äú1st choice players,‚Äù of which, we‚Äôd likely only be able to recruit/afford one.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ryb2p,t1_j6rxyyd
"We look stronger while City look weaker since they lost Cancelo. Liverpool and Man U arguably had worse windows than us. Chelsea might be a threat next year but not this season. 2nd half of the season looks promising. Bummed we didn't get mudryk but trossard looks ready to contribute straight away so he could be an important player for us.  


Jorginho might not have been first choice but he was at the very least midtable starter quality this year (lol), he is a proven winner who is used to the league, and I think he might fit our system better anyway since he is a very good on the ball player. For a january backup player I think its a good signing considering the fee and contract length, I'd much rather have him than no one or the elneny/sambi options we had before january.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rzxbq,t1_j6rxyyd
"We did get a ridiculous bargain on √òdegaard, and Chelsea arguably overpaid for what Enzo is now, but he is a very talented and quite different player.",Arsenal,Yes,j6scgx4,t1_j6s6gbs
Enzo won't become a flop. But for sure that's a massive overpay that positive return on player sales is highly unlikely.,Arsenal,Yes,j6s7rma,t1_j6s6gbs
"Thanks for posting this, wonderful read. I'm backing off the ledge.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sgfn3,t1_j6sennu
"that is hilarious, I didn't realise he's 6'7 either lmao

the first goal when he stops the ball on the goal line and nearly loses it to the defender loool",Arsenal,Yes,j6sgtpz,t1_j6sf9rg
Who is that?,Arsenal,Yes,j6sgh5q,t1_j6sf9rg
You know this fella is scoring at least once against us,Arsenal,Yes,j6sg7by,t1_j6sf9rg
Does it? It‚Äôs just a collection of hyped names and nothing coherent.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r56z6,t1_j6r4uu4
Does it? Seems a bit of a mess still,Arsenal,Yes,j6r51za,t1_j6r4uu4
"They have 15 new players and a new manager and backroom staff.

Can't imagine how they can possibly gel and get the managers ideas ono the pitch, will be relying on individual brilliance for results for a long time.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r5ecv,t1_j6r4uu4
"It's sometimes unbearable when we do it for Spurs but what Chelsea is doing is unprecedented. It hasn't been seen before since Chelsea did it in 2003-6. It's worth discussion, if it isn't 'throwing your toys' discussion. 

That said, being insecure about a club you're 21 points ahead of is weird. They got a few flashy toys, spent ‚Ç¨600M, but seriously, you have something good going. This could have been a lot worse. Imagine it's 2020, we are 8th as it was and Chelsea is up by 21 points.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sk84r,t1_j6s5y2f
"Yeah, but Lokonga barely played outside of EL and cups. I think we will be fine without him.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4657,t1_j6r3vam
"Our chances against the top teams drastically go down without Thomas but I now feel like we can batter smaller teams without him. 

Mo was always too safe in possession against teams that sat off (hence the weird moments where he'd have the ball for what felt like an eternity) but Jorginho can pass through the lines consistently so we should be good on that front. On the other hand, Elneny is good in big games because he has 6 lungs and can cover ground quite well, but Jorginho can't do that so we will be very reliant on our structure holding together to hide him.

Thomas's biggest superpower is the combination of elite progression and physical tools to always be in the right spot. Elneny provided the latter and Jorgi will now provide the former. There should only be a few games were we need a dominant, ""complete"" performance from Thomas and more games where the passing aspect is crucial, so covering that attribute makes perfect sense.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4fd7,t1_j6r3vam
"This is what I was saying. Don‚Äôt get letting Sambi go for now. Even if you just sub him on late on in games we‚Äôve got wrapped up, it helps reduce the minutes of the key midfielders. I like the Palace loan but we should have waited",Arsenal,Yes,j6r3z1j,t1_j6r3vam
"‚ÄúSeason over if Partey gets injured‚Äù.

Alright, calm down",Arsenal,Yes,j6r608p,t1_j6r3vam
"5 years is still a bit too much if we're being honest.

If Chelsea had offered some of those guys they've got on 7 year deals, 5 year ones it doesn't make too much of a difference really.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4im1,t1_j6r46y3
They have assigned seats with names engraved on the chairs since they know they‚Äôll be there for a long while,Arsenal,Yes,j6ruzyb,t1_j6ruhe2
I think the rule is to not loan out to foreign clubs.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rzdv4,t1_j6rz4g9
"I'm in a mood to shit on Chelsea, but kind of wild how they really fucked over two players like that because of the Enzo deal.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t2z3t,t1_j6t1gid
My condolences for your loss. I hope he enjoyed what he did get to see this season.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r8p0r,t1_j6r8hkt
"Condolences, fellow Gunner. Would be a nice gift to him when we win the league!",Arsenal,Yes,j6r8vnx,t1_j6r8hkt
Sorry to hear that man. That‚Äôs super tough. I hope we deliver a title this season for you and your dad. Hope you and your fam take care.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r9gt2,t1_j6r8hkt
"Certainly helps that we did the double over spuds, that kinda cooled the hatred",Arsenal,Yes,j6vlyub,t1_j6vc5za
That's assuming we get penalties called in the first place...,Arsenal,Yes,j6r925w,t1_j6r8c2i
"Agreed much better places to spend the money. 6, 8 and RW.",Arsenal,Yes,j6twc83,t1_j6tvseh
"We need to tie him down first, last I heard Chelsea was sniffing about",Arsenal,Yes,j6u3nab,t1_j6u37ow
"The scary thing is that I can genuinely see Sousa being our inverted LB in the next few years, and he's probably not even in my top 5 upcoming Hale End talent right now. It's actually insane.",Arsenal,Yes,j6uqndo,t1_j6uobgq
Charles Sagoe Jr too?,Arsenal,Yes,j6ureys,t1_j6uobgq
"Think Norton-cuffy would make a good Right Winger in sakas position eventually if not next season. Might be good to try him out there if we cant/dont get a right sided  winger. 

Remember Saka started off as a fullback too",Arsenal,Yes,j6v0ul1,t1_j6uobgq
"We got done exactly what we needed to get it done, with minimal risk to dressing room disruptions which I think is not mentioned enough. Our 1st team is good enough for the title so we brought them support and set us up very well to challenge for the title even if we get injuries to key players. I'm very happy with this and very excited to see who we bring in in the summer now. COYG",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4m7m,t1_j6r415j
"Sambi too, hope him and Marq smash it out there",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4ziu,t1_j6r415j
Antony is Marquinhos with blonde hair and can spin better. 3-4 mil.,Arsenal,No,j6r50ro,t1_j6r4t3o
Probably the first football tournament that Boehly watched end to end.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r4lnd,t1_j6r4f14
"I‚Äôm happy with either tbh. I agree he looked better than white against United but Everton aren‚Äôt a threat and we know white is fully capable, was just having an off day.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rfzxf,t1_j6rfox9
"A fit Tomiyasu is better than White at RB imo but
Ben White had a poor half against United, don't think Arteta will drop him for 1 bad half",Arsenal,Yes,j6rhc1k,t1_j6rfox9
"Thinking about this recently too. Even with good results, we've had some absolutely thin benches, a lot of academy kids.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rvfa4,t1_j6ruvff
Imagine by the end of next summer what it could look like,Arsenal,Yes,j6rx858,t1_j6ruvff
"7/10.

Kiwior unproven in the league, Holding proven not to be good enough (although I suppose good enough to be 5th choice CB) and Vieira needs some more meat on his skinny body.

Other than those its pretty good but can obviously be improved further.",Arsenal,Yes,j6s234q,t1_j6rwl3t
6.89,Arsenal,Yes,j6rwyse,t1_j6rwl3t
"I mean if City's bench is a 10, then it's got to be a 6/7. But I think it's good enough to help finish the job",Arsenal,Yes,j6rxsjq,t1_j6rwl3t
"lacking a striker for now, but when one of Jesus or Eddie is on the bench then it's a really solid bench

ESR/Trossard/Eddie are fantastic offensive options off the bench, as are Tierney and Tomiyasu for defensive options. Jorginho is solid, just need Vieira to be more reliable off the bench",Arsenal,Yes,j6s1hxg,t1_j6rwl3t

Pure evil indeed",Arsenal,Yes,j6tdhxg,t1_j6tcn2v
"He's actually playing well at Lyon because he's the focal point of the attack, unlike here in his last years where he was used to create space and chances for the wingers",Arsenal,Yes,j6uc3vt,t1_j6u746f
"A lot are really close.

Partey has been sensational. It's not a crime to say Rodri or Casemiro has had a better season so far.

Martinelli has been great. Even Trossard has a claim to have had just of strong of a season.

Odegaard has a claim for best player in the entire league this season. But again, if someone said KDB, who has largely been the best player in the league the last ~5 years, they aren't an idiot.

The best part of this team is that while we have great individuals, we aren't reliant on great individual performance. It is a fantastic team and structure. Everyone elevates the level of the rest.",Arsenal,Yes,j6v8qaz,t1_j6v29zf
If he has a decent 6 months maybe we could sell him to Chelsea for 100m,Arsenal,Yes,j6r57lm,t1_j6r4k3i
Stop drinking.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r4pia,t1_j6r4k3i
"He'll score a couple of goals and everyone who doesn't watch Palace will be like WOW WHY DID WE LET HIM GO HE CAN REPLACE XHAKA and as soon as he comes back he'll lose the ball or be out of position, we'll concede and everyone will say ""oh yeah shit""",Arsenal,Yes,j6r53o4,t1_j6r4k3i

"He's probably 7th in the depth sheet of two wing spots. A series of loans awaits that guy. I understand leaving a big team's academy, but to go to Chelsea's? Better off going to Fulham/Palace",Arsenal,Yes,j6sby6p,t1_j6saizl
"They have 8 players on loan, maybe 1 of them has a future at the club.",Arsenal,Yes,j6so3qr,t1_j6snsbk
Hopefully. Could be a great player if he can find it again.,Arsenal,Yes,j6stjlg,t1_j6sssxd

"Unless Fresneda was to be an RCB and lead to the sale of Holding, it was far fetched.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vyymj,t1_j6vy0qu
"Fresneda seems to have been an almost opportunistic transfer, at 18 he's not displacing anyone in the first team just yet, not even Holding.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vzbkn,t1_j6vy0qu
"Also Fresneda is really young. If he was to play for arsenal he'd hardly get a match unless Tomiyasu moves to CB. So it's fine. Dude's 18. He needs to play. We're not chelsea that we get an 18 year old then have 6-7 players ahead of him. 

Omari, if you're seeing this, great decision. Good luck with your 5 loan spells",Arsenal,Yes,j6vzb4p,t1_j6vy0qu
Lol weren't those the same idiots screaming Arteta Out,Arsenal,Yes,j6rfpfc,t1_j6rfdxh
"Thank you. This is what I‚Äôve been saying. It‚Äôs actually crazy how deep rooted and widespread this narrative is. ‚ÄúEdu wanted Royal‚Äù, ‚ÄúEdu can‚Äôt negotiate‚Äù, ‚ÄúEdu is a release clause merchant‚Äù, ‚ÄúEdu is a fraud‚Äù and on and on‚Ä¶ 

People who spend less time F5ing on Reddit and twitter for Arsenal news all seem to think he‚Äôs doing a very good job. I remember Fabrizio saying he thought Edu was ‚Äúone of the best in the game‚Äù and that we needed to give him time, and that was in the summer after we had finished 8th for a second time. He‚Äôs being proven right and people are still calling for Edu‚Äôs head. It would be hilarious if it wasn‚Äôt so annoying.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rfzhl,t1_j6rfdxh

I‚Äôm very confused as to how anyone could have this perspective.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rg55b,t1_j6rfdxh
"I'll once again reiterate that literally any Arsenal fan would have done the job Edu has done here. 

He has never pulled anything out of the ordinary. Arteta wants a player, Edu inquires, he gets quoted a price, he tries to negotiate and spectacularly fails, and finally decides to pay the full price. If no other team is in for the player, we sign them. If another team is in, we don't. The sole exception was Jesus, and that was 100% down to Arteta approaching him first and guaranteeing that he'd be the big man. 

Not one single transfer under Edu has gone differently. 

I won't even get into the sales.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rgso9,t1_j6rfdxh

I know we have ""principles"" but every big name transfer besides Jesus he has gone after he has not been able to get it over the line.  Weeks of drama, back and forth, follow-up bids.  I think he has found us gems but lets not kid ourselves that his ability to get the top top players is not proven yet IMO",Arsenal,Yes,j6rz65r,t1_j6rypkt

However, I am concerned how we fumbled the Mudryk deal. Not even due to the player, he might flop it's a big risk att 100 mil and Trossard is great, but I would've liked our processes to be more efficient.

They are already changing the rules so from the end of the season being able to spread the cost like they have for FFP will be a no no.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r57jc,t1_j6r4xz6
"Chelsea were ahead of the pack. The loophole whatever they exploited will be closed for everyone else.

"Londoner here as well mate. And I can tell you that I despise Chelsea more than I do Spurs. Cannot wait for Jorginho to lift the PL with us this year. All those filthy, scummy cunts will be absolutely seething about it.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sbbra,t1_j6sajz6
I think it's quite telling that their local fanbase isn't particularly big. Most of their fans just jumped on the bandwagon when they were winning. With Arsenal you can say that at least we have an identity. If a club doesn't have an identity then what exactly are the supporters supporting?,Arsenal,Yes,j6sbhnr,t1_j6sajz6

He wants to play in the Major League Soccer World Series.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r9s7j,t1_j6r8ot4
"An even shinier silver lining is to look at the amount of money the club was willing to spend this window, and last window, without CL revenue.  It makes you wonder what the club is willing to do in the summer knowing CL is around the corner.  

It's hard to get too bent out of shape with Edu & Co., we were beat by money.  Chelsea is in a position to spend big because they've had years of CL money and a new owner who has, possibly, made assurances to invest a substantial amount of money in the team.  Arsenal had more restrictions just by virtue of the club's position.  

We came out of the window better than when we entered.  That's a mission accomplished even if the lights aren't as bright as we initially hoped.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rx5bs,t1_j6rqlm6

Still not an amazing team though if you compare to us.  Shit keeper, shit no.8s, worse forwards.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rubom,t1_j6rsgau
he's the one now that mudryk is gone,Arsenal,Yes,j6so3s3,t1_j6snl84
"Actually sort of shameful the way they did him tbh.

On his way Atletico for a 6 month loan only to be told that actually he's having the last 18 months of his contract terminated.

And all to get a new RWB for 45M who won't be able to play under whoever their new managers system is when Conte walks in the summer.",Arsenal,Yes,j6swxh5,t1_j6swa7b
Man signed a six month contract with Atletico just to escape,Arsenal,Yes,j6swhdi,t1_j6swa7b

"He‚Äôs not a defensive powerhouse by any stretch, but he can read the game well and will be surrounded by Zinny, Benny Blanco, Gabriel and Saliba.

"We need to beat them at the Emirates. We haven't beaten them in the league since 2015/6, it's a huge statement win for us, will help massively with morale, and ease the pressure.

Also will give us an extended cushion, maybe allowing for a loss/draw at the Etihad.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rj0zd,t1_j6rhvdk
Two draws wouldn‚Äôt be bad because they‚Äôd gain no ground on us but I‚Äôd love to beat them at the emirates.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rils1,t1_j6rhvdk
Absolutely,Arsenal,Yes,j6rjb47,t1_j6rhvdk
Outstanding window all things considered. Particularly for January. We get exactly what we needed; quality depth in key positions. As a bonus we didn‚Äôt even get too badly ripped off.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rip4b,t1_j6rhy2n
Nah I really like Turner tbh. Fine with him there,Arsenal,Yes,j6rrtug,t1_j6rpm0c
Turner earned some respect against City.  I don't see a need to draw a line in the sand on when he gets time in the EL.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rq2px,t1_j6rpm0c
Turner looked like he would put ramsdale under pressure for his league starts against city tbh.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rrmwo,t1_j6rpm0c
"Turner deserves it. after a shaky debut, he's been largely excellent.

It was hilarious how he shut down Haaland by simply rushing out of his box like a madman and kicking it long every time the Android had a chance to run in behind.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rumz7,t1_j6rpm0c
"If that 90 million goes towards a generational talent like Camavinga or Bellingham, 100%",Arsenal,Yes,j6rsb2j,t1_j6rqhzc
No. He‚Äôs extremely hard to replace and it doesn‚Äôt even look like we could get a project player (caicedo) in his position for the same fee.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rreub,t1_j6rqhzc

Yup,Arsenal,Yes,j6rquvh,t1_j6rqhzc
"If we got Rice and Caicedo or equivalent then it'd be a no brainer given Partey's age.

"no, because we need a year at least so he can show his apprentice most likely Caicedo who we will go in for in the summer the ropes. Preferably 2 years. that is priceless, we can sell him then for 25 mill or so.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rr3ro,t1_j6rqhzc
"Incredible footballer but in a heart beat, yes.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rrllq,t1_j6rqhzc
Obviously yes.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rs34e,t1_j6rqhzc
"This past window, not a chance; we'd have crippled our own title push.

This coming summer? No again, because we're hugely dependent on him, and we'll want to at least maintain our level. No-one we buy is going to be able to walk into his role. (Shoutout to the idiot who thinks Jorginho is going to do that lol)

There is a *tiny* possibility that if we make a major signing at the 6 in summer, that player might bed in fast enough that we could consider selling Thomas a year from now. I doubt it, but it's not impossible.

That would bring us to the summer of 2024, when Thomas would have a single year left on his deal. I'd argue Thomas is one of the top three 6s on the planet right now, and on his day, capable of outplaying the other two head to head. Even then, I doubt anyone's offering 90m for a player with a single year left. But even if they did, the question would still be to what extent we're dependent on him, and what losing him would cost us.

If and when we have a player who can (and already has, to a significant degree) step in for him, sure; until then, the price of Thomas is above rubies.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rrgg3,t1_j6rqhzc

Sell Balogun (painful), Pepe, Mari, Lokonga (if he does well at Palace and we can get 20) Tavares or Tierney (or both and bring in another LB but probably not).

Is it going to have any repercussions? No

"People were pissed at how Aston Villa fans were pushing the narrative that they were coming for our spot. I would not call their interest in our player disrespectful in anyway. It's football. They didn't try to tap him up. They just submitted bids. Do you have any idea how disrespectful clubs can get when they really want a player? Guys are acting like this is cesc to Barca all over again. Mind you, we still did business with Barca after that truly disrespectful transfer.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r8ewk,t1_j6r7hlm

If Villa offered 50 or 60m then its comparable.,Arsenal,Yes,j6raf3x,t1_j6r7hlm

"I was initially against it as I didn't think we'd get him on a short deal, he's miles better than either Elneny or Lokonga and will be a good enough backup for the next 1.5 years at least",Arsenal,Yes,j6rgvv7,t1_j6rgond
It's normally the opposite way round,Arsenal,Yes,j6rhdt8,t1_j6rgond
It's how you know we're back with the big boys tbh. Lots of bandwagon opinions throwing a tantrum about Edu and Jorginho because 'we'll be laughed at'. As if banter is the only measure of whether Arsenal can win a title lmao.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rlgvg,t1_j6rgond

That discussion is a lot easier when you feel like the person on the other end of the phone isn't actively trying to fuck you over. You can be more open about what you want and need, it's a matter of trust.

Clubs let their players speak to other clubs and set things up to see if a deal is worth attempting. But if you don't trust them not to pull some shit then you can make it more difficult for that to happen.

Relationships and trust do matter here.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sbyxv,t1_j6s7nac

"Yeah, I'd have loved Moises but Brighton weren't kidding around sadly. I think Jorginho will actually fit our team a lot better than Chelsea's tactically. His biggest weakness is mobility but he's got great positioning and technical ability, so the fact the we love to compress the pitch, don't require our 6 to roam too much, and will have athletic inverted fullbacks either side of him will really suit his game.

Don't they have loan listing on the site?,Arsenal,Yes,j6rar05,t1_j6ran8x

Bernardo Silva is prob leaving so makes sense,Arsenal,Yes,j6sajqo,t1_j6s8m6w
Really wonder why we bought Vieira instead of him given it seems we have endless pockets.  Seems an odd choice when Maddison is a similar role but ready to go and was ripping it up.  I know he would probably have been double the cost but you'd get value for money.,Arsenal,Yes,j6s9hzi,t1_j6s8m6w
"To say nothing of the fact that when we saw ESR there last season, it was in our very earliest days of trying 433-- and often with Sambi as the 6. Trying to use that as some kind of definitive evidence against him is just silly.

We are much better at this now, and with better and improving players everywhere around the left 8-- which has, at the same time, moved and closer and closer as a role to something ESR can play, while he's been learning and developing behind the scenes.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sbhqc,t1_j6s98x0
"Agree. Xhaka playing in spots ESR is very comfortable in. Xhaka has played great this season, but the higher up the pitch he gets the more his technical abilities and creativity are exposed. I think ESR could excel there. Especially in games where we are more offensive minded.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sbfx4,t1_j6s98x0
"Yeah the system is there now for him to thrive. He can be very good there, he loves operating in xhakas channel when he‚Äôs deployed as the left wing, can‚Äôt wait to see him and Gabi together on that side. Not to mention trossard",Arsenal,Yes,j6saa70,t1_j6s98x0
It's not as impossible as it seems. They are outsiders but i've seen stranger things happen. 42 points from 18 games is obviously going to be impossible if they continue to play like they are but in general it wouldn't be a shock. The biggest obstacle is the fact they have to play 4 of the big 6 away still.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sc77h,t1_j6sbgpj
"4th probably gonna need 75 points, Newcastle and United both look good",Arsenal,Yes,j6sg8i1,t1_j6sbgpj
Bottling 2 goal leads is a perfect way to get yourself a free pass to the Championship,Arsenal,Yes,j6sumuk,t1_j6stzy3

He‚Äôd be behind Osimhen for Nigeria and not sure he‚Äôs ever played for them. Apparently is interested in the US though and he‚Äôd be a nailed on starter so I think England would have to convince him.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tghee,t1_j6tg4g5
United for me. They have a lot of money regardless of if they get CL. And CL typically keeps their owners happy and they don‚Äôt look beyond standard 2-3 signings.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tibox,t1_j6thrzf
Anyone but Chelsea. Spurs ideally because they will keep deluding themselves by keeping Kane.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tiqal,t1_j6thrzf
Would rather Spurs and I never thought I‚Äôd say that. They still won‚Äôt win anything so it doesn‚Äôt really matter where they finish as long as it‚Äôs below us.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tia95,t1_j6thrzf

I can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôve spent so much and their team looks like something you cook up in fifa. Genuinely few difference makers came in for 600m,Arsenal,Yes,j6smhi7,t1_j6sj6rr
Potter doesn't deserve any plaudits. They have ¬£60m players as 3rd choice who would start at most clubs. If Chelsea don't win the title next year he has done a poor job.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sjmwa,t1_j6sj6rr
"Things will be interesting, should they miss top 4 this year; missing out on Europe all together would be something, but missing out on the top flight is almost as significant, financially. 

They may benefit from only competing in/focusing on the league next season, but every match will be a battle. Their talent is inexperienced and those with experience are shells of their past glory. 

They‚Äôre building front to back, and no attacking talent can compensate for a porous backline and shakey keeper. 

It will take a masterstroke from Potter to make the CL next season, not that it would be at all surprising. This team looks a lot better in FIFA than it‚Äôs set to be in reality.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sm6f5,t1_j6sj6rr
I don't think people's main concerns are about Chelsea this year specifically - most know they aren't going to dent us much from here. It's the potential that they are gathering after unprecedented spending.,Arsenal,Yes,j6slj79,t1_j6sj6rr
"We shouldn‚Äôt sell Balogun, but we aren‚Äôt going to keep 3 strikers happy lmao",Arsenal,Yes,j6v4m3d,t1_j6v3sws
"A PL loan might be a good move for Balogun. If Eddie keeps improving at his current rate, will be hard to bench him for Balogun. Eddie is basically doing what we hope Balogun can do. A PL loan for Balogun and see how he gets on, somewhere like Palace might be a good move for him.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vcmje,t1_j6v3sws
Choose who you think is going to be better Nketiah or Balogun and sell the other for $50M. No brainer. We're not an oil club. We have finite resources. Use the money to build depth or reinvest in younger players. Between Jesus and Nketiah/Balogun we have the striker position locked down for four years. No need for a third with that value. And too much risk to let it keep floating. His value could easily come down from what it is right now.,Arsenal,Yes,j6vfk86,t1_j6v3sws
"538 has CL qualification at 69 points, which is lower than most years. Chelsea currently on around 7% chance.

Arsenal about to win the league while Spurs about to get relegated. Give me that timeline.,Arsenal,Yes,j6vu331,t1_j6vh04m

"Have to hope that Rice not leaving them in Jan has kept some goodwill with West Ham AND that he explicitly states he prefers us over Chelsea.

That'd be needed to not be fucked over in another bidding war",Arsenal,Yes,j6rkv0m,t1_j6rit9e
Probably Rice or Caicedo is the plan. Have to figure Chelsea will get one of them.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rjkpr,t1_j6rit9e
United basically need Harry Kane and a midfielder and they will be streets ahead of Chelsea.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r5yxj,t1_j6r5tro
United are 1 striker away from being a very strong team as well.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r5vwu,t1_j6r5tro
Chelsea are a discombobulated mess,Arsenal,Yes,j6r624x,t1_j6r5tro
Based on what? In the past they signed Lukaku Werner and Havertz and they are all shit well maybe not Havertz but still signing players and using how much you pay for them as basis for their talent is a disaster.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r7203,t1_j6r5tro
"Meh, come summer I don't think there stance will be as stubborn, they just really want to get European football and in the summer they can get a proper replacement and go again",Arsenal,Yes,j6r9k0a,t1_j6r8nqy
"a chelsea fan was in the DD thread yesterday and told me he's kinda always been like that. just one person's perspective tho! 

but i wouldn't be surprised if a lot of jorginho's ""lost legs"" were just systemic issues with late tuchel and potter, and also a lack of kante

which is good for us because in place of kante, we have positional play that won't leave him stranded in the middle of nowhere with acres of space to dribble around him like a cone",Arsenal,Yes,j6rgec3,t1_j6rg1v7
He has always been slow.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rga16,t1_j6rg1v7
"> Jorginho has never had the ability to turn on a dime under pressure

Jorginho does this very well to be fair. 

> drive forward 20 yards to open up space like Partey can.

But not this as he can't carry. 

He compensates for that with his line breaking passing which he would have the chance to do at Arsenal with options ahead of him running in space.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rlxek,t1_j6rkrzt
"I really doubt Arteta would assign him the same tasks as Partey, he'd probably tweak the system a bit",Arsenal,Yes,j6rl3sv,t1_j6rkrzt
This season is the first season that partey had performed better than Jorginho in his entire career btw,Arsenal,Yes,j6rlwjd,t1_j6rkrzt
I am not concerned at all like not any more than I would be to face the likes of Brentford or Leeds away. We‚Äôve been playing some really good stuff. I have no doubt we will see what we‚Äôve been seeing all season long. Maybe even a thrashing (anulo mufa),Arsenal,Yes,j6rxj56,t1_j6rueea
The shift has been weird with Everton cos all I remember is us dicking them constantly at Goodison and just think of the opening day of the season where we thumped them and Denilson scored a banger.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rusz5,t1_j6rueea
"Valid concern but I see our mentality being much better than in past years. This is one a late Wenger team would lose 2-1, easily.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rv64k,t1_j6rueea
"They‚Äôre set at striker, with 3 more years of 30 year old Lukaku making ¬£16.9m, annually",Arsenal,Yes,j6sguyt,t1_j6sggw8
They'll just spend more money,Arsenal,Yes,j6sisb6,t1_j6sggw8
"He would have to deal with big egos as well, or at the least, players who cause a lot of problems to the club's environment and culture. Take Ziyech as an example. 

For us, Arteta had to deal with Ozil and Auba",Arsenal,Yes,j6t2qlc,t1_j6t1vlh
"Chelsea really feel like a soul-less club.  They aren't built for a coach to spend a long time building up players and establishing a culture.  They buy-loan-liquidate-change coaches-repeat.  Yeah they have won trophies, so it can achieve that kind of success.  But it seems like a horrible mess to be a supporter of.  How can you have any real connection to the club?",Arsenal,Yes,j6t62nr,t1_j6t1vlh
"Now that they have spent 300 mill in this window, don‚Äôt think Potter will survive two months if their performance doesn‚Äôt improve drastically. It is not even Boelhy, the spoilt Chelsea fans will be the first to show him the way out.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t43g9,t1_j6t1vlh
"Its quite simple really. 

We had Auba and Laca starting with Gabi and Eddie as backups for them. When they both left, Martinelli became the undisputed starter while Jesus came in to be our starting striker. 

Now we brought in Trossard to compete with Gabi on the left, but Eddie has proven himself to be quite capable as competition for the #9 spot. Even thoufh Balogun looks quite good, he‚Äôd be third option and not really the same as Gabi, even when he first cane in. 

Considering the value we could get for him and how much depth we need in other areas (right wing and midfield especially) it doesnt make sense to hold onto an asset like him when the money would have a greater impact on depth elsewhere",Arsenal,Yes,j6t92c5,t1_j6t855d
"I know Balogun is a really exciting prospect and we ought to give him a chance but
- We have 2 established strikers who are playing well
- Both our strikers are young and there is no pathway for Balogun in the future
- We don‚Äôt fix something until it‚Äôs broken and rn the 2 strikers are relatively happy with the game time and Arsenal is happy about their performances.

Why people are insisting on selling him this summer because his stocks will be the highest right now and we might not get a better opportunity to extract most value from him. We need to learn when to sell (Remember AMN) and I think we should maybe put a sell-on or buyback clause and defo sell him.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t96gg,t1_j6t855d
The sale idea is because we already have two strikers.,Arsenal,Yes,j6t8uvo,t1_j6t855d
"1 ) To make some sales

2 ) No one on god's green earth carries 3 strikers let alone a team that only plays a 4-3-3 lol

3 ) I doubt he wants to come back here and warm bench

4) We have 2 good strikers right now.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tan8k,t1_j6t855d
"We have two elite strikers on five year contracts. Attachment to Hale End kids aside, he is a good prospect in the market. Good for the club, will get a good fee. Good for Flo, he could be the starting striker for a LOT of teams in any of the top leagues",Arsenal,Yes,j6t98w1,t1_j6t855d
[deleted],Arsenal,Yes,j6t8vd1,t1_j6t855d
"I'd obviously like to keep him to see what he can do first but sensibly it'd make sense to sell because he'll have 2 years left so it's a good time to sell, he must be worth 40mill, and we don't really need him.

Alternatively you sell Jesus, Eddie takes the no.1 spot and Balogun is no.2. which seems a bit illogical given how good Jesus is for us as both what he brings himself and the different options he gives us with Nketiah who is a different type of striker.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tccbd,t1_j6t855d
"Lol, let them ask for him.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tnffq,t1_j6tnayt

"Benfica topped their UCL group which had PSG and he was instrumental in both games. In fact, Benfica was better in the midfield battle and Enzo was one of their best performers.

I also think they massively overpaid but they also overpaid for many other players.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r5od5,t1_j6r52x2
"No one is 120m good unless you are a generational talent ala Mbappe etc.

Chelsea have just fucked the market",Arsenal,Yes,j6r5tbb,t1_j6r52x2
Look at his fbref data. For me he's up there with any midfielder under 23 in the world.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r5wep,t1_j6r52x2
I don't think that's true. Reece James and Thiago Silva could possibly get into our starting eleven. Even Enzo Fernandez and Mudryk seem really good.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r93j9,t1_j6r8o8x
Next summer is where all eyes will be on the board. We're finally back at the big boys table. Top players that cost top money want to join us. We can't miss out on players like that anymore.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rix55,t1_j6rha7b
"Here's the thing tho, those fees are not insane anymore. They are now just the market prices. So, if we are to sign a player like Caicedo, or Rice, or anyone like that, whether this January or in the summer or whenever, we will have to actually pay one of those ""insane"" fees. 

And so far, in 6 windows under Arteta, we still haven't done it once. Our club record signing is still from before Arteta, that's basically ancient history in football terms. Every rival has set a new record in that meantime except us. 

So while I agree that we did a decent job with our Plan B, the fact that we failed on Plan A yet again leaves me very skeptical that we will actually sign Caicedo or Rice in the summer either. We seem to have a ceiling on the transfers we are able to secure, and it's way lower than all of our rivals' ceilings (not just Chelsea either).

In other words, decent window but I'm just tired Robbie",Arsenal,Yes,j6ri8c1,t1_j6rha7b
"No no. I'm not going to change your mind. I agree with you.

Think Jesus is going to have to accept he will be played out wide at one point, as much as I love his silky smooth cutting through the lines and assists the number 9 needs to score a lot of goals and both eddie and balogun have a way better goals per game than him",Arsenal,Yes,j6ttj1x,t1_j6tsz5b
">ither Jesus plays RW, or we sell him or Eddie.

hold your horsies, is France.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ttf92,t1_j6tsz5b
cant wait for chelsea at home. its going to feel damn good thrashing them.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rly7m,t1_j6rjgoy
"Your problem is that first sentence.

It's not someone else's money, they're not a sportwashing vehicle where the value is how well the club is performing and Boehly isn't the main shareholder.

The govt made them promise to invest ¬£1.75b into the club so it is presumably factored into the takeover costs but one of the major shareholders is an investment fund, another is a property developer and these people will be looking for a return unlike Roman or middle Eastern monarchies.

Now he may be going for a turbocharged version of a young team that can grow together and he needs to because quite frankly he's tied himself to them as much as they are tied to the club but so far he's not shown much patience with managers and with the famously impatient Chelsea fans that he seems to be trying to bribe to stay inside if he's going to try and give project managers a quick turnaround demand he's going to fail.

Equally as we all know the Jose's and the Contes of this world expect to be backed with new players to get their instant success and that's going to need more spending and at some point jettisoning someone on these long contracts.

They've already got an issue of five of their new players not being allowed to be registered for Europe, even with a huge clear out one season of Jose could push those issues again and all the time you're adding to that yearly amortisation bill.",Arsenal,Yes,j6srn1s,t1_j6spa8a

"They are deservedly 10th right now and have largely spent on project players.

Might Enzo and Mudryk become world class? They absolutely have the potential, but they are a long ways off.

Success right now for Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, United is beating City and winning trophies. That's very, very hard as we are about to find out one way or the other.

And that's not even mentioning Newcastle and Spurs, who are currently better than Chelsea as well.

Chelsea can fail just simply by *one* of City, Arsenal, United, Liverpool, Newcastle or even Spurs being consistently better than they are over the near future. That's the same for Arsenal as well.

"Mudryk or Enzo have not done anything in their careers to prove their price tags yet and it‚Äôs far from a guarantee. They‚Äôre also on 8.5 year contracts. A lot can happen in 8.5 years, for good or bad.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t5qa7,t1_j6spa8a

Agree with you but the one thing that might work in their favour is that there might be competition amongst other clubs for some of the players they want to offload due to the fact these players are all very young. It might work it might not... It would be fun for us view from the sideline in the next few windows.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r9lve,t1_j6r9cby
"Not particularly. As much as I hate them, this kinda makes sense. 

They're obliged to invest 1.75b as a part of the take over process. Might as well put it on the highest rated youngsters on the market right now. 

Long contracts help with amortization. 

Even if Mudryk or Enzo is a huge flop, there'll always be some taker for them. iirc West Ham bought famous liverpool flop Andy Carroll for 15 million!",Arsenal,Yes,j6rbw0s,t1_j6r9cby
"Depends what you mean by strongest.

In terms of talent in the league - Yes.

In terms of teams having their shit together - No.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rb50d,t1_j6rb010
"Top teams are weaker but the rest barring a couple of exceptions are better than ever, and possess more talent than ever.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rbwe7,t1_j6rb010
"Probably not. Except for us, Newcastle, United, brentford, Fulham and Brighton every team is having a bad season",Arsenal,Yes,j6rbifi,t1_j6rb010
He‚Äôs probably had the most engagement in his career over the past couple of days from winding up Arsenal fans. Stands to reason he‚Äôll keep it up for a while.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rc10w,t1_j6rbpsw
The most depressing thing about our backing out of the Caicedo deal isn‚Äôt that we didn‚Äôt get the player. It‚Äôs that he won.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rc44k,t1_j6rbpsw
Transfer windows are exciting but I'm so glad we can just focus on the actual football now,Arsenal,Yes,j6reslm,t1_j6renpf
Feels like football is just a thing that happens in between transfer windows now,Arsenal,Yes,j6rfphb,t1_j6renpf
"Why is such important?

Let's say we identify a very mediocre player as our #1 target. One summer we spent months chasing Joel Campbell. Is it good we lock that down?

If we identify Mbappe and he doesnt come, is that bad?

Let's just look at the squad come sept1",Arsenal,Yes,j6tmyxo,t1_j6tk9sv
"No idea. Who knows who the number 1 target will be come summer anyway.

I'm 1000% confident they'll get us good players.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tm1ds,t1_j6tk9sv
"I 100% agree, it's a little concerning we seem to struggle to tie down our top targets. Even players like Zinny and Jesus were 2nd choice and have to feel the arteta connection helped the deal more than anything.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r63r9,t1_j6r3wdt
Since Arteta came in we‚Äôve only made one key signing in midfield which was Partey (unless you include √òdegaard). Quite mad,Arsenal,Yes,j6r4455,t1_j6r3wdt
"Really doubt Potter wanted him leaving at this point, I'm sure he'd have preferred Gallagher to go.  Played George in 99% of games. 

We now have the best pair of DM's in the league so.....  bit daft being anything but happy.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4l4p,t1_j6r3wdt
"I guess because of Elneny we hadn't made a serious effort before. But atleast they showed interest for signing Rice in summer.

But even if we didn't get Caicedo what are our other options? We were linked with Bamba and most players didn't want to leave mid season. Considering other options Jorginho is a safe bet with less price that doesn't affect us in anyway.

But come summer if we don't sign someone, then we should question Edu but for now it's ok",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4au5,t1_j6r3wdt
"we always had a back up, no one was willing to accept it. it was el neny

we wouldn't have signed jorginho as a back up if our back up hadn't gotten injured",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4bdl,t1_j6r3wdt
Jorginho said in his interview that Arteta has tried to get him a few times. Obviously Arteta thinks that he has something to offer in midfield as a backup to Partey. It also aligns with the 300k passes in the opponents' half that Arteta mentioned. Pretty clear what the idea is there for 6 months.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r5kvs,t1_j6r3wdt
I think Liverpool might be in a bit of trouble as well tbh over the next 2-3 years. I see them perma dropping to Europa/conference for a little stretch.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rwpz4,t1_j6rp5lm
"Chelsea lost their only consistently fit midfielder. They spent too much money on forwards.

I'm not sure how much Liverpool can spend in the summer. No CL + they blew their warchest on Nunez and Gakpo",Arsenal,Yes,j6rpc48,t1_j6rp5lm
"Have you seen how much they have to spend in the summer on the current loaned in players? Along with the amount of players out on loan, it's insane. Their summer window is going to be fun to watch.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rr5am,t1_j6rp5lm
"If we end up throwing the title and the EL and end up with nothing then yes it‚Äôs OK to complain about the action we took in this window. But the club have got us 5 points top at the halfway point, I think they‚Äôve earned a bit of trust",Arsenal,Yes,j6r7h6s,t1_j6r78t2
Who would be the last statement signing for us?,Arsenal,Yes,j6rfvt5,t1_j6rfqof
"Not if City have anything to do with it tbh. They are richer than us, can offer him more wages and even if we win the league they are still in contention for it for years to come. I‚Äôm not even going to get my hopes up a bit.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rh83j,t1_j6rfqof
"We got Odegarad. 

Lokonga was a mistake but it had nothing to do with selling Willock.",Arsenal,Yes,j6socp2,t1_j6smyap
"If you want to think of signings offsetting one another, it was really Willock for √òdegaard-- which is a deal I'd take all day long and twice on Sundays.

I'd have been quite happy to sign √òdegaard and keep Willock, but that was a good deal all round: we got a good fee for a good young player we developed; Newcastle got a good player they needed at a reasonable price; Willock got a move to a side where he'd get plenty of minutes.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sndnn,t1_j6smyap
"They are two separate deals though. We didn't buy Lokonga because we sold Willock, we sold Willock because he was extremely mediocre and the money we received was fantastic. Lokonga has turned out to be underwhelming but when signing youngsters there's no guarantee they are going to reach their potential.

So yeah, it was a smart move. It just didn't work out as well as we hoped.",Arsenal,Yes,j6snlyj,t1_j6smyap

"Jorginho is extremely durable (https://www.transfermarkt.com/jorginho/verletzungen/spieler/102017), as is Xhaka. We‚Äôre technically lighter in midfield, but I wouldn‚Äôt be concerned. 

Elneny was barely fit so while it is 2 out, we never really relied on him this season anyway.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rnqoq,t1_j6rmh3t
nah a big part of our fans are just trash and would turn on him regardless,Arsenal,Yes,j6tq12x,t1_j6toiz5
"I think some people expect too much from a 22 year old trying to learn one of the most physically and mentally demanding positions in the sport, while playing in a new country in the most competitive league. He just turned 23 in October and needs minutes to iron out his game. You pay for experience with points, and Arsenal haven‚Äôt been afforded the luxury of being able to throw away points since he‚Äôs signed.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tprn3,t1_j6toiz5
"I personally didn't watch the said scene. My opinion of the guy is built on what I see in game. And if the documentary nailed the same conclusion, it's Lokonga that has to work on himself.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tp72a,t1_j6toiz5
Nah his poor performance is the reason most fans have turned on him. If he had performed well after that clip people would have used it to say ‚Äòlook he took eddies advice and stepped up‚Äô,Arsenal,Yes,j6tsb91,t1_j6toiz5
"I can‚Äôt wait for the ‚Äúleave Chelsea, win the league‚Äù memes man",Arsenal,Yes,j6rc8vq,t1_j6rc2eh
"None of those challenges really seemed sustainable.  In this one we've reinforced the squad where it needed it. Attacking cover, midfield cover and cb cover.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rh6bx,t1_j6rghny
Fuck (and I can not stress this enough) Vlahovic,Arsenal,Yes,j6sganz,t1_j6sf90q
I have no interest after the disrespect he/his entourage showed the club last January. I think he‚Äôs off the club‚Äôs recruitment list because of it.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sh5w4,t1_j6sf90q
"Nah. I'm very very happy with our forwards at this point. What I want the club to focus on is a midfield revamp, can't let it get to the point where our mids are too old to run anymore like Liverpool has

Priority targets should be zubimendi and rice",Arsenal,Yes,j6sfxc6,t1_j6sf90q
"This comes up every now and again but a lot of dominos have to be in place.

First we have to decide that Jesus is a winger. Then we decide that Trossard is a CM/8/10 on the left. After that, we also decide that one of Vieira and ESR has to leave, either permanently or loan. 

Then we also have to hope both Chelsea and Manchester United are insane not to realise they need actual 9s.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sik4v,t1_j6sf90q
Chelsea needs a Striker they will be willing to pay 100m for him.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sgn99,t1_j6sf90q
Locatelli first,Arsenal,Yes,j6sg498,t1_j6sf90q
"He had his chance.

We've also got two first team strikers and we need the long term successors to Partey and Xhaka and still that elusive Saka rotation firsr",Arsenal,Yes,j6shdvp,t1_j6sf90q
Hes got the number 9 Jersey he will be happy lol. Let the best talent emerge.,Arsenal,Yes,j6umg65,t1_j6ulog2
Jesus has said in interviews he prefers to play on the wing. I doubt he'd be that upset about it,Arsenal,Yes,j6ut1oq,t1_j6ulog2
I think he'll bond with the Brazilians bc he speaks Portuguese and was born there.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rctwp,t1_j6rcisd

New best friend: granit xhaka,Arsenal,Yes,j6rcovq,t1_j6rcisd
our worst transfer windows are all the ones from 15/16 to Artetas first summer window in 20/21. Not a single good transfer window in there.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rpng4,t1_j6rny5w
"Nah there's no place for him with √òdegaard, ESR and Fabio here.",Arsenal,Yes,j6szp92,t1_j6syoi7
"No, he's not going to be happy rotating, he's bloody expensive and in ideal world ESR does the same thing for us.",Arsenal,Yes,j6szmg3,t1_j6syoi7

Why on earth would we be moving for a striker in the summer lol,Arsenal,Yes,j6tt1fq,t1_j6trjur
"Through June 2025.  We might have an option on top, we like to do that.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ts8o8,t1_j6trjur
Unlikely to go for an out and out striker. I think we will look for someone that covers Saka's position and is flexible enough to fill in centrally and on the left if needed.,Arsenal,Yes,j6ttz7w,t1_j6trjur

"Obviously Newcastle.

There is literally no situation where I would want Man United win a trophy, even if it's against Spurs.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ub9yw,t1_j6u8z6j
Newcastle. Not a fan of the Saudi money but listening to United fans suddenly rating the EFL cup and wanking over ten shags will be cringe,Arsenal,Yes,j6ualn2,t1_j6u8z6j

Yes yes we get it edu bad,Arsenal,Yes,j6tegjc,t1_j6tec9h

lol you are delusional if you actually believe this,Arsenal,Yes,j6tex0y,t1_j6tec9h
"If you watched Partey at WC, you'd have seen him playing right side of a three and it wasn't pretty. He moves languidly round the pitch and is a terrible presser. He only shows great athleticism in short bursts, best keep him in the middle. 

I do believe Jorginho would do well with a ball winning left 8 though. Pair him with Declan Rice who can drop back regularly and cover him and zinny for example.",Arsenal,Yes,j6upau0,t1_j6un8at
I think it works fine but however it is unwise to play both number 6s on the field.,Arsenal,Yes,j6upgap,t1_j6un8at
If Xhaka hurt Viera will fill that spot. That is the plan (hence Lakonga loan). Zinny probably oir emergency 8 if Viera stink it up,Arsenal,Yes,j6uqjvv,t1_j6un8at
Onana and Kone are not better than Jorginho btw. People just want them because they think ~~a dm has to be a tough black guy~~ every signing has to be some young player with potential. FIFY,Arsenal,Yes,j6t5j06,t1_j6t4cx8
"they aren‚Äôt better than Jorginho, but that‚Äôs a very weird comment to make",Arsenal,Yes,j6t5tc4,t1_j6t4cx8
They're both projects to become better than Jorginho though.,Arsenal,Yes,j6t6mjg,t1_j6t4cx8
"Have no idea about Kone, but, if we are talking about Onana from Everton, he will never be better than Jorginho in the future, as well. He is physically a beast, but, terribly inconsistent on the ball and very rash off it. Don‚Äôt think technique and passing can be improved significantly beyond a certain age.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t77b6,t1_j6t4cx8
"Kone isn't even a DM. 

People just didn't want us to do business with Chelsea.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t93qd,t1_j6t4cx8

I love how everyone - except Chelsea fans- are in agreement that Potter will not last at the club. I almost feel sorry for him. Insane recruitment that he has no part in and the expectations will be so high.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rk4se,t1_j6rk0jk
"Let's see those players gel on the pitch before we judge. This can be a disaster for Chelsea. A bloke from the Ukranian league for 100 mil, a guy with just a great WC for 120 mil - a bunch of players for 30, 40 mil, without much thinking... It could go very wrong.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rkrwu,t1_j6rk0jk

I think there's been a big overreaction to his form, ok he's hasn't been getting g/a the past few games but he has still looked dangerous. 

But saying that I would be tempted to start Trossard. He's looked electric.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sutmn,t1_j6su5x2
"This year?

Or three games...

Mate.",Arsenal,Yes,j6svp96,t1_j6su5x2
"Martinelli has been excellent, doing exactly what Arteta has asked of him in Jesus' absence: taking the opposing RB and at least one other defender out of the game.

And he's still been creating, despite being constantly double-teamed, and with far fewer options than Saka has on our right.

I expect we'll see Trossard-- but because he's good, not because Martinelli has been bad.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sxgif,t1_j6su5x2

"*""Here have some Ligue 1 players, be right!""*",Arsenal,Yes,j6tipdo,t1_j6ti5mj
"Nah man no way are we even loaning balogun to that shitstain of a club. He deserves better, by the very least I'm thinkin uncle vieira",Arsenal,Yes,j6titg7,t1_j6ti5mj
"I mean, Mikel has never said that Partey's profile is his ideal preference for a 6 in his dream system. The fact he tried to sign Jorginho multiple times and that City wanted him when Jorginho was at Napoli suggests that. Partey playing there might just be dealing with the best he has available to him right now. Even though Partey is playing at an elite level.

Reading Ornstein's quotes over the last few days it seems Zubimendi was the priority midfield signing, Caicedo was the second choice. He probably wants a more Busquests style player at the 6 position in the future.

Wouldn't surprise me if our priority is Rice and Zubimendi in the Summer.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rqeek,t1_j6rpz6i
"I'll ring the club and inform them that u/imeternallysuffering doesn't trust edu to sell. We'll get someone else in to do the job, who do you recommend?",Arsenal,Yes,j6tig9x,t1_j6ti51w
"We almost this lad on a free transfer. He even said his goodbyes. We re-signed him at the 11th hour and preserved his value, loaned him to an ideal set up...now his value is up from what could have been zero...and you're still questioning the decision makers?",Arsenal,Yes,j6tiwuj,t1_j6ti51w
No one asked,Arsenal,Yes,j6tiq0m,t1_j6ti51w
I think we starting to look that way. Like in the City FA Cup game we limited City quite a lot having made like 6 changes to what would be ourr normal starting lineup whereas they played more or less a full strength side. Adding more quality players like Jorginho I think we'll make it further into these competitions and distribute the mins around the squad players more evenly,Arsenal,Yes,j6uk20s,t1_j6ujkf1
"no team can, not even City. they literally had to sell jesus and sterling. also sold aguero and ferran before

the only senior star that was happy to be a rotation was gundogan,  but he could play multiple positions so he's the perfect cover for that.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w4wiq,t1_j6ujkf1
"Caicedo was just not available. If we don't get help in CM, we are fucked but if we waste funds on players that won't improve us much, then we should spend as little as possible, a la Jorginho. Now if those funds are not added to pile of cash to get Rice, Camavinga or any of my pipe dreams then I will be mad at Edu. Mudryk looks to be one we will regret but imagine if spunking 80 mil out  didn't turn out well for us, our summer would be impacted. So I am learning to trust the process even when it looks shit because I remember when I didn't trust as much and turned out I was wrong.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tety3,t1_j6tdeto
"Brighton are a very admirable club

Their success is success for the sport 

I hope that they can sustain their model because big clubs are trying to pick them to the bone and while they have done remarkably well to stay successful I‚Äôm not sure that they can continue to consistently replace their quality players and staff with comparable quality",Arsenal,Yes,j6vecjl,t1_j6vbqhg
Idk why u guys don‚Äôt like Brighton all of a sudden. They didn‚Äôt wanna sell one of their best players what‚Äôs the big deal here?,Arsenal,Yes,j6vc13k,t1_j6vbqhg
"I honestly don't have much against Brighton, we got Trossard. They didn't want to sell Caicedo and made it really clear, they did not want to sell. Is it their fault for not accepting offers they didn't want to take? If Chelsea however had bid 80m and got a deal done, I'd be a bit more pissed off.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vc6un,t1_j6vbqhg
"Yup, we‚Äôre owed their players!

This is so weird, the teams most likely in the Europa and Conference league positions besides Brighton will be Chelsea, Liverpool, and Newcastle/Spurs. I would 100x rather a well run team that plays a really nice style be in that spot over fucking Chelsea and Spurs. 

The transfer saga had absolutely no bearing on how I feel about Brighton and besides us, don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a team I root for more than Brighton. Brentford too.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vechc,t1_j6vbqhg
ESR should not be for sale.,Arsenal,Yes,j6u0bu3,t1_j6tyzw5
That's not really how it works. I agree there should be some sales eventually but ESR hasn't been used in this new arsenal yet and he could feasibly replace Xhaka in his role.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tzh5n,t1_j6tyzw5

"Ignoring how unbelievablely stupid this take is for a second, palace is probably the last team in the league that would racially profile a black man.

edit: lmfao u/pewpew62 still tried to delete this:

> I remember Vieira saying last year that he wanted more physicality in his team, seems as though palace recruitment just racially profiled Sambi and assumed he's physical because he's black. He's is not really great at anything in particular so I don't see how he fits into a midtable potentially relegation threatened team where you need grafters and/or creative outlets. I don't foresee him getting much game time **although I hope I'm wrong.**

I can‚Äôt see our first choice midfield being broken up. They are in the middle of a title challenge and are having great seasons; they deserve to finish the job unless form falls off of a cliff. But Jorginho will get his games for us.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sjosh,t1_j6sivsw
"I can't imagine it tbh. From what Chelsea fans are saying, Jorgi has been playing side to side football for too long. He's just here to do Elnenny's job.",Arsenal,Yes,j6skldf,t1_j6sivsw
Absolutely no way. I can see him starting a PL game if we have a tougher Europa game midweek but there's no way we change up the best midfield in the league.,Arsenal,Yes,j6syb2t,t1_j6sivsw

"No, a member of the team was not up to the level required, and didn't seem to take in what Ode was saying hence the escalation.",Arsenal,Yes,j6st78q,t1_j6ss8fl
"The thing you're missing is obvious context.

These players bust their ass in training every day. It's why we are top of the league. They do the video sessions. They have gave it their all in matches.

Now, Ode is our captain. He sees someone not doing the basics. The stuff they have done 1000 times in training, been shown in video.

Everyone else is doing their job.",Arsenal,Yes,j6su5zq,t1_j6ss8fl

"I‚Äôm ok with it. Collectively we cannot carry passengers and Lakongo wasn‚Äôt switched on and didn‚Äôt track his runners.

">too small to hold it up in the PL

He‚Äôs listed as 5‚Äô10 which is the same height as Jesus and only an inch shorter than Eddie. Not to mention he actually seems taller than that- looked taller than Henry.
Size and weight don‚Äôt matter, give him a season to get in the gym and he‚Äôll be fine.

Selling the top goalscorer in a top 5 league for 25m+ is ridiculous, especially considering how young he is. If he was just a Reims player, they would be asking twice that minimum lmao",Arsenal,Yes,j6uny4p,t1_j6umpdj

Oh is this sale only for silver members? I always have the tab open at work so today when I got in I refreshed the page and i was added into the queue around 9:23. I'm a red member though so I guess I wont be able to buy anything.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rc2vz,t1_j6rbx0h

I dont see any world in which Jorginho usurps Saka as the pen taker unless he's not on the pitch.,Arsenal,Yes,j6riluq,t1_j6rhx02
They will have settled the priority taker in training.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rj74k,t1_j6rhx02
"Jorge is a better penalty taker but 90% of taking a penalty is having the balls to do it calmly so it really doesn't matter.

Bonus for Saka is the stat padding that rival fans only use to rate players.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ridfg,t1_j6rhx02
"He is naturally a right back. He wasn't great when he initially joined City, but became world class when he was moved to left back

This season he has failed to replicate that form, so Pep became increasingly hesitant to play him",Arsenal,Yes,j6rr7c4,t1_j6roe0o
Hard to say. Every player Chelsea have signed in that second striker mould has failed to adapt to the Premier League so far so will just have to wait and see.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rsbvz,t1_j6rrwez
Don‚Äôt trust bundesliga stats until they replicate them somewhere else.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rvhks,t1_j6rrwez
"Every time a player makes contact with the ball it‚Äôs a touch. However, most models take an instance of possession as one touch so if I trap the ball take 3 touches and then pass it that still only counts as one statistical touch. A pass is an attempt to play the ball to another player.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ruzxk,t1_j6rufuu
"A touch is from being in possession of the ball until you're not, so it can end with a pass, shot, or dispossession.

A pass is giving the ball to your teammate.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ruvhj,t1_j6rufuu
"If you receive the ball and lose it to say a tackle or whatever it‚Äôs still a touch. 

If you release the ball intentionally towards a player it‚Äôs a pass. 

If you release the ball intentionally towards a player and the player gains a touch it‚Äôs a completed pass

Basically - touch is on receipt. Pass or shot is on release. Completed pass and shot on target are successful releases.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ruvwn,t1_j6rufuu

Yes i also think he can cover for Xhaka,Arsenal,Yes,j6sir6x,t1_j6si72t

More than you believe....

I'm not sure it's likely, though. I've moved on from Caicedo and have decided it's absolutely imperative that Edu gets Camavinga out of Real Madrid.

"Hard questions all through. I personally have no clue what we are trying to do in midfield. 

All our targets ‚Äî Rice, Camavinga, Zubimendi, Caicedo. Then the ones we have‚Äî Partey, Xhaka, Lokonga, Elneny, Jorginho. 

The ones we have are conservative pivots. Good in ball progression, winning it and possession.  They don't exactly shine that bright in the final third. 

The ones we are targeting are the same regardless how many people are trying to wish into existence, their powers in the final third. They're meh there

I have a personal want I've been saying on here‚Äî my hatred for City/Barca like single pivots. I want a little bit of caution( 2CMS) especially in big games or tournaments. MAYBE that's what we are looking at? Maybe we want a Gundogan and a Rodri? Maybe a Rice and Zubimendi? Instead of a Rice and ESR/ Rodri and Silva. 

Maybe we want an 8 that's balanced the 6/8 role well. Because I kid you not, I rather Rice - Zubimendi, than Rice - ESR.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tbkob,t1_j6sx596

"So, the strategy from now on is just overpay for every target immediately. Should have just offered 90M straight away despite us potentially not having that and the player not being with that? 

Caicedo isn't worth more than our initial bid. We have to get close to Brightons valuation, but we also have to give consideration of our own. This 'failure' happens at every single football club. Its not a failure, its the game.

Right now you all want to have your cake and eat it.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rbws1,t1_j6rbbj3

"Aside from the ethical stand point in football of bigger clubs being able to just throw money at a problem in the hope that it fixes, these prices are not sustainable and will have an impact on everything in football.

Costs of players go up and everything follows, from sponsorships, to ticket prices to merchandise. The more money that flows through the game, the more corruption etc 

Also, real life inflation levels whilst only being temporary and likely to go down are still high, so less people will be able to afford to support their club in that way.

Given the size of clubs, how they are run in terms of a business are absolutely insane and don't work in any other sector. And they're starting to not work in football, see United's financial issues.

I love the work Arteta has done so far, but essentially relying on him to continue getting it right every time is doomed to fail. No one is perfect and whilst we can afford to make the odd mistake, clubs like Chelsea are able to drop 80m on a keeper, 100m on a striker, 105m on a midfielder and if they don't work out they just throw more and more money at it until something sticks.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4f37,t1_j6r41mv

His attacking contributions this season have almost preposterously outstripped his historical average, especially through our first 12 matches (though admittedly regressing of late).

Imo just like Eddie, we haven‚Äôt even seen Balo‚Äôs real and true potential yet and he‚Äôs already scoring better figures than some strikers in their prime in Ligue 1. If we sell him to say a Dortmund and he becomes a 60-70m striker for them, would be one that got away.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t9ufi,t1_j6t8vd1
No way we only get 30 million for him. I know Arsenal is bad at selling players but he‚Äôs English and is tearing up league 1. If we don‚Äôt get at least ¬£60 million we have failed immensely.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tdo3l,t1_j6t8vd1
"Plan A was Mudryk. Who was definitely not worth ¬£89m no matter how you justify it. Caicedo, admittedly, would've been a perfect signing. But he simply wasn't for sale. I don't know why people don't understand that.

Remember that 5 of those 6 windows happened when we were 8th and 5th. In the summer, with potential champions league and the money that comes with it, I'm positive we'll be able to get the players we want. The ceiling can be raised and the knock will hit different. This window alone, our top choices wanted to leave at the hint of being able to join us.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rsokn,t1_j6ri8c1
"I also think his smart positioning and cut off ability will help offset some of his lack of pace, and he'll sit deeper relative to where Partey would push up given Jorginho's abilities on the ball I think he'll still be effective in progressive passes from slightly deeper.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r45xc,t1_j6r3whi
"I reckon when Rice first comes in he‚Äôll play as an 8, maybe for the first 1-2 seasons, then he‚Äôll eventually get moulded into a 6 as Partey‚Äôs successor",Arsenal,Yes,j6r6qtk,t1_j6r6msu
Yeah I vaguely remember that's his trait- never being fit. Wild risk,Arsenal,Yes,j6rs1vk,t1_j6rrrls

"Liverpool already plans to buy 2 midfielders in the summer, and Chelsea's season is a write-off, but you can already see the improvement, next season they will be levels above spurs with the rest of the top 6 clubs. It's fine if you don't believe me, but next year when the rest of the 5 take spurs to the cleaners we can both enjoy it. plus spurs don't have money either. they spent a ridiculous amount of money, I think people forget that.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rq058,t1_j6rpc48
"I remember the dark days of ""we shouldn't sign Ode over Willock because Willock guarantees 10+ goals a year and Ode doesn't shoot.""

What disrespect?,Arsenal,Yes,j6sixk9,t1_j6sh5w4
I mean are you sure? He left City for more game time. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be content with being a bench player just because he has the shirt.,Arsenal,Yes,j6uoo7m,t1_j6umg65
"Knowing how versatile Maddison is, he can play as an 8,10 or even as a winger. We have brilliant starters at all those positions now, but he can provide solid competition at all those spots.",Arsenal,Yes,j6szmja,t1_j6syyoq
"There are very few players on the market better than Balo/Eddie, and both are still improving.

"Holding isn't going anywhere. 

He's a leader, he's homegrown and he's a happy, solid backup in his prime years.

But what if selling Balogun to Man U meant we get Bellingham,Arsenal,Yes,j6vip62,t1_j6vimxa
I say it's delusional to pretend we aren't dog shit at selling players.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tfamw,t1_j6tex0y
"We have Nkunku coming in the summer and will most likely sign Felix on a permanent deal. Before this year Mount was one of the best young English players in the league we‚Äôll see if he regains his form. The 10/8 largely looks set. Striker is a hole we‚Äôll see what happens there. 

Defensively we signed Badiashile who look immense so far next to Silva. Fofana is getting healthy and next year we‚Äôll have the best young CB in the league back from loan at Brighton. Chilwell and Cuca LB and Reece and Gusto RB defense will be fine. Only holes in the squad are striker and a proper 6 and maybe some more midfield depth",Arsenal,Yes,j6ruphj,t1_j6rku9b
You don't think they'll go ballistic in the summer on replacing those areas? In this January window alone they have spent TWICE as much as the other top 4 leagues combined.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rl83g,t1_j6rku9b
It's his own fault for going to Chelsea of all clubs.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rk8eh,t1_j6rk4se
You are right but in spite of that they still win a lot. Having lots of failures doesn't matter when you can continually replace them until you get it right.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rkkg8,t1_j6rkequ
In the last 10 years alone they have won every single trophy and that's with a fraction of the backing we are seeing right now.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rkqcn,t1_j6rkn07
"Reiterating my comment down below as well, we have been extremely fair with Brighton everytime we have dealt with them. 50 mil for Ben White, around 25 mil for a 28 yo Trossard with a running down contract. 

Then we offer in excess of ‚Ç¨70 mil for Caicedo and Brighton get butthurt. These guys got him for 3-4 mil half a season ago like calm down lmao.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r5x9s,t1_j6r5qi2
I'm not worried. But we should have got the player in doing so.  Ruining the relationship and leaving with nothing is the worst possible outcome,Arsenal,Yes,j6r713b,t1_j6r6meh
Because we persisted after the 1st bid,Arsenal,Yes,j6r65mz,t1_j6r5ufp
I'm not overtly negative about every aspect of the club so no. I back the academy lads way more than most for example.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r6z2j,t1_j6r6i9s
He should have accepted a wage which was suitable for a player of his level then !,Arsenal,Yes,j6ubr8d,t1_j6u6en3
He still deliberately fucked over the club that stood by him just to end up on the wrong side of Iberia,Arsenal,Yes,j6u75y1,t1_j6u6en3
Yeah and Eddie is in form rn and might take that starting 9 spot,Arsenal,Yes,j6u2uy9,t1_j6u2h2s

Stronger?,Arsenal,Yes,j6u2ims,t1_j6u24qa
"What I took from that info is not the ""relationship is ruined"" part. Who the fuck cares. The part I took is ""Arsenal misjudged the situation"". For me that shows they made a bit of a mistake - it seemed pretty obvious to plenty of us (not exactly football ""experts"") that Brighton had no need to and wouldn't sell Caicedo. So I was very confused that we kept pursuing it. And we seem to have wasted a lot of the last few days on it.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r8cwi,t1_j6r7wpz
"They told us not to do something and we did it lol. They consider that disrespectful whether we/you agree or not.

"It's not his technique that's the problem it's his decision making. He'll get into good positions and then have the dumbest brain farts, he'll boot it up, lose the ball clumsily etc.",Arsenal,Yes,j6to88i,t1_j6tmj2v
"Watch the All or Nothing and watch the coaching staff gush over him and his metrics, which they called, ‚Äúoff the charts.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt buy him a season ago to flip him, and they didn‚Äôt loan him to increase his transfer value. I imagine his loan was a lot like Smith Rowe‚Äôs, where Arteta told him he wasn‚Äôt going to watch a single match, he only wanted to hear what his coaches and teammates had to say about his character/personality.

Like Smith Rowe, the talent is there, the question is the mental. Both lacked confidence, but in different ways; Arteta sent them on loan to determine if they could mentally cope with the dressing room and mental demands of the premier league.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tmte0,t1_j6tmj2v
"If you remember the Fulham game, KT was subbed off for Nketiah, Gabi dropped to WB, and they shifted to a 3-5-2. We haven‚Äôt seen it much this season, because we‚Äôve largely been ahead and Eddie is now starting, but it‚Äôs a formation Arteta turned to when trailing last season, and something that was heavily on display in the preseason. 

It‚Äôs a niche role, but a valuable one. I also imagine he could play on either flank, as he‚Äôs quite two footed, or as a late defensive sub at either wing, when the legs get tired. He just turned 23 last week, so there‚Äôs plenty of time and competitions for him to get minutes.",Arsenal,Yes,j6trerp,t1_j6tqnn4
We only found out Partey had pace last game tbf üòÇ,Arsenal,Yes,j6r7zg7,t1_j6r6rav

[deleted],Arsenal,Yes,j6svruj,t1_j6svp96
"Disagree, think he's been pretty poor since the wc. Poor first half against west ham, really poor against newcastle, poor against united. Delivered against Brighton alltough his overall play wasn't impressive. If it's his form or down to Jesus absence I'm not sure but I'd like to see Trossard given some starts for now. Martinelli did look good coming off the bench against City, so having him with his pace the last 30 minutes could be very good too. But I think some competition is good for him.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t83g4,t1_j6sxgif
"I *think* they were trying to say if spending ~80m on Caicedo blocked a summer move that would have been foolish.

I think.",Arsenal,Yes,j6skqj2,t1_j6skkyn
"Jorginho and Trossard obviously. 

We will have Partey and Jorginho for no. 6 position. It could be the difference between signing Rice and Caicedo, and signing one of them. Don‚Äôt think Jorginho would be expected to be 3rd choice no 6.

For this reason I think Caicedo ship has sailed now.  expect Liverpool or Chelsea to sign him.",Arsenal,Yes,j6srdfc,t1_j6skkyn
"> I mean, Mikel has never said that Partey's profile is his ideal preference for a 6 in his dream system.

Apart from signing him, and turning him into a 6 who is absolutely crucial to our setup and our success, and forcing him to play every second he can, to the point of actually shoving him onto the pitch when he was injured.

I am a big fan of words, but there are times actions speak louder than...

Jorginho will be firmly benched behind Thomas.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ru7ah,t1_j6rqeek

">He's is not really great at anything in particular so I don't see how he fits into a midtable potentially relegation threatened team where you need grafters and/or creative outlets.

nah this totally saves it.  Most accurate description of Sambi I've seen.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sgu36,t1_j6sg03j
Suddenly this makes so much sense lmfao,Arsenal,Yes,j6smbl4,t1_j6slwzt
"Yeah, the rotation will be stuff like when we play Villa 3 days after City.",Arsenal,Yes,j6slemk,t1_j6sjosh
"Jorginho has a lot of the qualities Partey doesn't and vise versa, but personally think that Jorginho's qualities are more suited the style Arteta is trying to get this team to play. I think Jorginho is going to surprise a lot of people with how well the team performs with him in the starting XI",Arsenal,Yes,j6sk5xe,t1_j6sjosh
Chelsea have dumb fans just like ours who say this is a stupid signing. He‚Äôs still a top player. I‚Äôm really excited to see him play in Arteta‚Äôs system. Arteta is the best manager he‚Äôs played under.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sl6pr,t1_j6skldf
Completly different team lol. He will be fired up for us fpr sure,Arsenal,Yes,j6sn8j2,t1_j6skldf
5'10? Jesus ain't no 5'10 surely. He got that small player body surely a tall 5'9,Arsenal,Yes,j6v6pxm,t1_j6uny4p
"Small is more than just height. Jesus is 161 pounds. Balo is 146. That might not sound like much but in boxing they'd be two weight classes apart, such is the advantage of 15 lbs. He's young so maybe he'll grow but right now he's small and whenever he's played for Arsenal, that's come across.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vogqf,t1_j6uny4p
I think if we sell him there‚Äôs no way we can afford him at full potential. He offers such unique striker movement mixed with False 9 skills. Give Arteta a player with his mentality and it‚Äôs going to be special,Arsenal,Yes,j6unhxk,t1_j6un15t

He is not the same player and it would be ridiculous for us to sign him.,Arsenal,Yes,j6ta927,t1_j6t9s7i
I would say his performances in the Bundesliga has not really been noteworthy at all. He has potential but i do think there are alot more players with high potential out there as a winger. But yes we could do alot worse.,Arsenal,Yes,j6taf8c,t1_j6t9s7i

"Right? I can understand if we wanted certain better players but damn we signed 3 players in January (2 of whom are PL proven and ready to hit the ground running) and boosted our title challenge. We are 5 points clear of City and the new players seem suited to our style of play.

Remember the meltdown when they signed Kai....,Arsenal,Yes,j6rhdez,t1_j6rfhhr
He was told after the opening bid lol. That's all the warning you need.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rc8wg,t1_j6rbnhy
"Caicedo is integral to Brighton, who are fighting for Europe for the first time in their history, under-21 and it‚Äôs in the last few days of the window, of course you‚Äôre going to have to drastically over pay especially with how the market is for these sorts of players. 

Brighton‚Äôs valuation will shoot up because of the situation that they‚Äôre in, that‚Äôs just how it is. 

They rejected 65m bid in 10 minutes and we came back with 70m like come on, after the first bid we should‚Äôve really tried to test them and bid 80/85+5 then if they reject that then you stop because it‚Äôs getting overboard.

Good deals are hard to find in January especially for hyped players obviously they shouldn‚Äôt just pay over the odds for every player but there is a time to negotiate and there is a time to pay.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rds0p,t1_j6rbws1
"There was a clause by Abramovich that the new owners would have to invest so many hundreds of millions in the first couple of years, fully expecting them to start seeing a return in their investment after that",Arsenal,Yes,j6s6kwp,t1_j6s3s3g
"Absolutely, but they have to go for top youth in order to spread it over such long contracts. It wouldn't work if they spent ¬£100m on 27 year olds over an 8 year contract",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4sev,t1_j6r4hef
Liverpool are further behind Chelsea in their ‚Äòrevamp‚Äô. Their owners really don‚Äôt want to spend,Arsenal,Yes,j6r5y80,t1_j6r42zy

"I know but still, 28 signings when for the prem you really only need 23 playable ones.",Arsenal,Yes,j6s4dhl,t1_j6s3fot
"Yeah but to be fair this is something we could have done last summer and definitely should have got done early this window. 

Elnenys injury really shouldn‚Äôt have been the trigger. We could definitely accommodate a midfield signing with a fit elneny.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r88qj,t1_j6r83m9
Doesn't mean we should've allowed the timeframe to get that short though,Arsenal,Yes,j6r89wy,t1_j6r83m9
Yup I like Wakanda Ball better.,Arsenal,Yes,j6uzuor,t1_j6uzaky
"By your logic if he didn't prove himself in the pl yet he should be more than enough for a 3rd choice striker.

"Transfer value varies greatly according to player situation. If next year we keep him in the squad and he's our third striker, his value will fall tremendously, even Flo will want to leave. I'm sure the club who see him m in training everyday would be best placed to make a decision. If next year he goes on another loan to a PL club and doesn't perform, his value will reduce. So you never know. Best to keep the person who's performing better in practice, training and sell the other one. Keeping 3 strikers is impossible",Arsenal,Yes,j6vxmph,t1_j6vxa4a

"Yeah, it was an even game overall although I thought it swung back in City's favour in the second half as we replaced Partey with Lokonga at HT.

Pep also acknowledged the changes after the game. He said at the Emirates with Zinchenko and Odegaard starting, it will be a completely different challenge.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rt4q7,t1_j6rsuya
Well he wouldve been a very good squad player.,Arsenal,Yes,j6vts8z,t1_j6vr7ml
"I‚Äôm pretty confident Balogun isn‚Äôt going to be the greatest striker in the history of the premier league. 

Successful loan spell or not. 

The chances that he will be is about 1 in a million. So yeah I feel pretty confident speaking in absolutes given those odds.

All your data says is that loan spells are not great predictors of future quality.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vvq6l,t1_j6vuw95

"I have never said any of that, all I'm saying is that literally anyone could do the job he's done here. Not to mention that he bid a lot of money for players too like Mudryk, Valhovic and Caicedo. They just don't get accepted.",Arsenal,Yes,j6riz3l,t1_j6riqv2
The Real Madrid player that literally no other team wanted who we paid just around the asked price for ? Who was also requested by Arteta ? And who Edu was looking to sign fucking Coutinho in his position ? That Odegaard ?,Arsenal,Yes,j6ridjh,t1_j6rhw7f
"What you want, incomings or outgoings ? Also, what year ? Literally every single team in the world has had transfer masterstrokes except us under Edu, I'll pull out lists for you",Arsenal,Yes,j6ri6as,t1_j6rhl2b
"Well yeah, because it's the media that's reporting negotiations. The football results are because of Arteta and his eye for talent and coaching ability. All our good players were signed because Arteta wanted them and no other team was in for them, and Arteta coached them well. Edu had wanted to sign shite players and couldn't sign other Arteta targets.",Arsenal,Yes,j6riiw5,t1_j6rhv7q
"To be clear, i am happy with the signings and he has been able to do shrewd business.  I am less happy that every big name we want to go after seems to fall apart so far.   His chance to prove us all wrong is the summer bc we need a world class CM not an up and coming player with a high ceiling",Arsenal,Yes,j6s03dh,t1_j6rzp16
"Yeah the people with doubts over him want to make it out like he's somehow the inexperienced one in this realm of executives and he's in over his head, when in fact he's had the most mature and levelheaded approach in a wildly inflated market, and it's only been paying dividends. 

The immaturity would be to succumb to the pressures of other clubs when he knows that's not what the players are worth. The thought of 'Don Raul' still stings to this day yet we still beg Edu to give in to what we already know ourselves to be ludicrous demands (I know I've been guilty). 

Even regardless of the final result this season, we'll probably be looking back at this period in awe at how he's helped raise the levels from where we were to where we got with such an austere policy.

E: Ramsdale an overspend? Hell, Chelshit needed 120m to find one half of a decent goalkeeper. White 50m? Topspurs on their third 35m rightback. Edu's been one and done, wouldn't say he's overspent once. Knows value for money like these clubs wish",Arsenal,Yes,j6s3rvc,t1_j6s0we6
"OK lets relax.  I am well aware he is not operating in a silo, but as a TD recruitment and negotiating is part of his actual job no?  And IMO, this is more than just ""give me a number for approval"", there are obviously tactics involved in how conversations are had, etc.  I am also aware not all of it is in his control (Vlah wanted Juve, Chelsea overspent, etc) but then I see Liverpool get Gakpo done with no noise or drama and it makes you wonder why all of our transfers are drawn out soap operas that we cant get done.",Arsenal,Yes,j6s1n7j,t1_j6s0sxc
"Let‚Äôs be realistic here, there‚Äôs still massive holes in the squad and we‚Äôre overachieving based upon how we all thought we would be.

It‚Äôs brilliant that we‚Äôre fighting for titles, and long may it continue, but we don‚Äôt have a squad (16-19 players) that you would expect to be fighting for titles",Arsenal,Yes,j6rdwsq,t1_j6rd31e
"I agree, however if we were quicker we could've close the deal before Chelsea offered an 8 year contract with crazy wages.

We had an agreement with the player very early on, we were just taking the piss in our negotiations with Shaktar.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rlnti,t1_j6rlel1
I'm a free registration user and I can watch it? If you are talking about the interview?,Arsenal,Yes,j6taoba,t1_j6syv55
Youll move on too. I was annoyed by that too.,Arsenal,Yes,j6t10wz,t1_j6svz2z
Neither. Money has influence over UEFA.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r5msj,t1_j6r5kfb

"Mudryk was not stupid. All their wingers are shit, that's why they signed Mudryk and Madueke.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rkhie,t1_j6rk03g
They think Silva would save them,Arsenal,Yes,j6rkr8a,t1_j6rk7ul
We signed Badiashile K2 hasn‚Äôt seen the pitch since and we also haven‚Äôt given up a goal since. Reece and Chilwell are back as well now. Defensively we are set attack we‚Äôll see what Mudryk Madueke and Felix can do still questions in the midfield but Enzo is a profile we were desperate for. A lot of what you lot are saying is cope about whether the team will gel or not these signing weren‚Äôt only for this year alone,Arsenal,Yes,j6rtz46,t1_j6rk7ul
"The wage bill has to get restructured sometime, right? I don‚Äôt think it happens with Jude; it wouldn‚Äôt be a great look to have everyone extend - with nobody earning over ¬£250k/week, only to turn around and make Jude the highest earner. Conversely, signing him before the key extensions would lead to a windfall for any player yet to extend. 

If/when there is a change in the wage bill, I imagine √òdegaard will get the first contract over ¬£300k/week, followed by an incoming player.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tdm1e,t1_j6tcj1n
Reality has no place in my telephonic fantasy.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tdn0f,t1_j6tcj1n
"Well if Villa had paid 200m we would‚Äôve sold him so yes he is for sale at the right price, the issue was they were messing around with 25m bifs",Arsenal,Yes,j6rcpk0,t1_j6raj5x
"Size of the club does matter though, Caicedo wanted the move and ESR didn‚Äôt.

Villa also offered 30m and we offered 70",Arsenal,Yes,j6r8ekt,t1_j6r7rc9
"1) ESR was an important player at that time, preferred to Martinelli
2) Villa offered us 30m and we offered Brighton 70",Arsenal,Yes,j6r89sn,t1_j6r7sh1
"It's strange because personally I took a boat load of abuse for not calling for Arteta's head as vocally as some others (lovely threatening DMs from some people who used to be in here).

I couldn't give a shit about being proved right or whatever and I'm more than happy to be proved wrong about things, but far too many things are treated as black and white when several things can be equally right/wrong at exactly the same time",Arsenal,Yes,j6r5fm1,t1_j6r4za9
"30 percent of which was add-ons, nobody accepting that for top midfielder talent",Arsenal,Yes,j6s8fkb,t1_j6s83nw
Elaborate,Arsenal,Yes,j6rgrhr,t1_j6rgi7e
"Yes. And their fans are creaming every time a deal is announced.  
  
Later they complain their signing didn‚Äôt live to their expectation.  
Since 2015/16 those are the bigger names they‚Äôve signed:  
Sterling, Felix, Lukaku, Kovacic, T Silva, D Luiz, Falcao.  
  
These are all A class players but only T Silva and Lukaku are S class players.  
So the list is packed with B class a lower players.  
  
Loads of risky signings for crazy money.",Arsenal,Yes,j6s9ib2,t1_j6s5vph
"Hmmm that's possible, I mean Boehly would be stupid if he expects short term success even if the spending is like that lmao",Arsenal,Yes,j6rcdb3,t1_j6rc7j5
So what I'm hearing is with CL football next year Maddison is coming on a free so we get 100millon of players for 30mill and kept Xhaka happy all at the same time.,Arsenal,Yes,j6siz8j,t1_j6shcyz
Maddison would be guaranteed a spot here.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sdwi1,t1_j6sa8ja
As opposed to stay at Leicester last summer....,Arsenal,Yes,j6sfdum,t1_j6sa8ja
We have the extra ¬£35mill though....,Arsenal,Yes,j6satv5,t1_j6sa8jg
IIRC Gnabry's father said that he's signing with Bayern before his transfer to Bundesliga happened so we knew (or at least suspected) from the start.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w0fot,t1_j6vz0p1
"I feel like if i was German, I'd really hate Bayern. Also then i was just watch matches and read newspaper kinda guy so I didn't realise the tampering. Bayern mostly do their poaching in league. But i really really hate Barcelona and their players' antics with Fabregas...it was so infuriating. I hope that club gets dissolved, obviously it won't happen because that's one of the only two beams holding la liga upright",Arsenal,Yes,j6vyrof,t1_j6vxom9
He deserves credit for spending 600m in a year and then fighting for the title? Are you serious or joking?,Arsenal,Yes,j6sn1hg,t1_j6sjtzr
"There's nothing redundant about spending money to replace underperformance and Chelsea can continuously do that until success is achieved. We just don't want that to happen during our cycle of being a top team.

The difference between then and now is, despite Potter's awful start, the squad he inherited wasn't great to begin with and his style is infinitely more progressive than the last 5 coaches they have had. The squad they are amassing now for a progressive manager to work with is scary.

Of course football isn't linear so there's no guarantee that what they are doing is going to be a success but from a purely speculative standpoint they are building something substantial.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sn1a3,t1_j6sm40n
"you people exaggerate the amount of ""rotation"" so much

no team plays 3 CF (or 3 of any position). not even man city.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w3ztb,t1_j6ver3i
Boehly is not independently wealthy and running the club like a hobby like an oil club. The buy contract had a stipulation to invest $1B to make the club more competitive. Eventually he will have to be profitable. Either you run the club as a hobby or a business. If you're run like a business you have finite resources regardless of owner resources.,Arsenal,Yes,j6vob7b,t1_j6vnpus
Liverpool‚Äôs top target will be Bellingham (assuming they have motivated ownership in the summer).,Arsenal,Yes,j6rkfv2,t1_j6rjr7d
"Any club you know in the world with three strikers?

We literally just let Cedric leave because you can't gamble on the prospect of 2 players getting injured for you to play.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tg1ga,t1_j6t9cqo
"We play a formation with one striker. There is zero reason to have 3 strikers in the squad. 

Might as well have 3 players in each position in case of injury, because that's how football clubs operate in your mind.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t9u1k,t1_j6t9cqo
"With that logic we should have 33 quality players in the squad, 3 at each position.

If and when someone is injured/suspended, we resolve that issue internally like playing Martinelli/Trossard at 9.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ta7s6,t1_j6t9cqo
"I've thought about it, we can carry Eddie, Jesus and Balogun, but someone gonna have to do some shifts on the wings lol. I'd like to keep him, we'll see.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ukbob,t1_j6tbplf
True. But neither is Balogun,Arsenal,Yes,j6tbh6p,t1_j6ta69x
Boo,Arsenal,Yes,j6te98c,t1_j6ta69x
what we need from jorg that we can't find in sambi is positioning to play from the back and jorginho is rated for his maturity in that regard so we can still play from the back even without partey compared to how sambi just hiding behind attacking player.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r4glv,t1_j6r45xc
We wheat to invest more,Arsenal,Yes,j6r4f50,t1_j6r478h
"He said Arteta tried to get him ""a few times"". Maybe he means a few times in the one summer, but I'd have thought he meant more than one window.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r63gd,t1_j6r5oo8
I'll enjoy the Spurs downfall as well.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rq2s9,t1_j6rq058
"It's been so nice to see 'dae √òdegaard can't shoot' die so swift a death, along with 'dae Thomas is really an 8' and 'dae Martinelli is our weak link'; 'dae worry about ESR/ESR should be sold/isn't an Arteta player' soon to follow. Always stupid takes, bludgeoned like seal pups.",Arsenal,Yes,j6so7no,t1_j6snng9
"It‚Äôs widely been reported he refused to Answer calls from Arsenal/Edu, after the club reached an agreement with Fiorentina. 

Since then, Edu/recruitment has engaged with the player‚Äôs side before approaching the club.",Arsenal,Yes,j6skarr,t1_j6sixk9
"We have 3 LW.

We have 1 RW",Arsenal,Yes,j6tv91p,t1_j6tuxc4
"His name is Starboy, the hell you mean",Arsenal,Yes,j6tv3c0,t1_j6tuxc4
"I do. I always didn't care about Spurs that much (dislike Chelsea and United more) . 

But now that the club is good enough to challenge for the PL again, I realised I never cared about them anyway.

I'm not local to north london I'm not gonna force myself to care and obsess about them like people here.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ue99w,t1_j6udobj
I doubt our club actually WANTS to sell Tierney. Only reason there are rumours is because he is the one who is considering a new club,Arsenal,Yes,j6vrfw9,t1_j6vrcub
There's almost no way we get Jude. Look at who's in for him and the money they'll offer.,Arsenal,Yes,j6vis89,t1_j6vip62
would rather keep balogun,Arsenal,Yes,j6vm1wr,t1_j6vip62
sure both things can be true. you believing what you said and edu not being able to sell well,Arsenal,Yes,j6tfkxz,t1_j6tfamw
this is an awful take lmao. which players did we have to sell under Edu that were worth anything?,Arsenal,Yes,j6tg4qv,t1_j6tfamw
"Well, it's going to be interesting to see how that actually goes together.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rwx8e,t1_j6ruphj
no I don't.  where would they get the money to do that from? No more spreading the cost over 8 years for FFP in from this coming summer so that means there's no way they can do this again.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rlive,t1_j6rl83g
"A lot of money and he will walk into a favourable job straight away again. 

I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs not unhappy.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rkjtl,t1_j6rk8eh
"You can buy all the individual talent you want but at the end of the day it‚Äôs a team sport. 

I see no evidence of a team here - I‚Äôll worry about it when we start to see signs of it. For now they‚Äôre a mess with big pockets.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rkv7n,t1_j6rkkg8
"I suppose the difference this time is that (in principle, at least) it will be difficult to replace these players given the wages and length of contract.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rkrw1,t1_j6rkkg8
Sure but that money wasted over the summer leading them to mid table. Who‚Äôs to say it won‚Äôt happen again? There are many other teams playing better football in a clearer system. Chelsea are a mess.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rl2lc,t1_j6rkqcn
"It's not ruined, they're just having a whinge. There'll be more deals on the future. We hardly did anything other than bid 1 more time. They'll get over it. We can just as easily point to the good working relationship to get White and Trossard as evidence of working cordially.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r7kbp,t1_j6r713b
"Oh no, we bid twice for a player.

What a horrible thing we've done.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r75py,t1_j6r65mz
"And I respect that but I do not get the constant complaining about honestly very minuscule things considering how massively we are over performing expectations this season, I was a child the last time arsenal were anywhere near this good",Arsenal,Yes,j6r7dh0,t1_j6r6z2j
Did betis a favour tho,Arsenal,Yes,j6uadav,t1_j6u75y1
Competition is good; nobody should be guaranteed a spot in the Starting XI,Arsenal,Yes,j6u364x,t1_j6u2uy9
"Maybe but I feel Jesus makes the team even better with his passing and pressing. It'll be interesting to see what Arteta does, at the very least Eddie will get even more minutes I'm sure.",Arsenal,Yes,j6u9uys,t1_j6u2uy9
The literal police are everywhere,Arsenal,Yes,j6u9p03,t1_j6u63my

"I feel like there's bots here, lol 

No way of telling, maybe, but any time anything big happens, the subs flooded with people with some of the most toxic awful takes. 

Maybe just fans of rival clubs being trolls. Maybe we're just gargantuan.",Arsenal,Yes,j6svntf,t1_j6sulrk
"There are more bots now then when be took over.

The only thing Elon was right about was that he definitely needed a hair transplant.",Arsenal,Yes,j6suwfw,t1_j6sulrk
"There were tons of people melting down about edu on the night when jorginho was announced as our likely target. Biggest meltdown that was since we lost to Newcastle last season.

"Just the finishing touch on the portrait, there.

The pretence that no-one watches non-Arsenal PL matches or the WC was the balance.

"Aaaaand, you just self reported.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t5u4n,t1_j6svsqg
"I think they needed a cheap back up to Tierney. He cost 7m and we could get 20m back for him. He doesn't have a future. Too careless in possession. Can't rely on him to retain the ball. Maybe in five years he'd be a good option, but what's the point?",Arsenal,Yes,j6tofd7,t1_j6tmte0

"Maybe, but it still doesn‚Äôt make sense. 

Why would buying Caicedo in January be ‚Äúshear stupidity‚Äù if it meant Rice doesn‚Äôt come in the summer? The business was just drawn forward, and one top CM was brought in over another (6 months early). 

I guess they could be a huge Rice fanboy, but even if Jorginho blocked Rice, it would be a brilliant signing, should Arsenal go on to win the league. 

I would trade a 10 year transfer ban for a title.",Arsenal,Yes,j6smsrx,t1_j6skqj2
No. I am taking about Jorginho. We will be investing 18m in Jorginho next season. It could be a significant deterrent,Arsenal,Yes,j6ss2lj,t1_j6skqj2
"> Don‚Äôt think Jorginho would be expected to be 3rd choice no 6.

Happily, signed at a budget price and with only a year left on his deal come summer, we won't need to give a fuck what Jorginho thinks about our future signings.

Balogun is no winger, his talent would be wasted out wide.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tzs2b,t1_j6tz9m1
Jorginho is more suited tactically to start against city and Partey to play against Villa though. Don‚Äôt think Arteta will be bold enough to make a call like that without seeing more of Jorginho in the team first.

"There is a huge range of more and less reasonable opinion between their 'Jorginho is a stupid signing' -- which he isn't, really, given the state of our squad -- and your 'Jorginho is a better fit and will displace Thomas', which is equally idiotic.",Arsenal,Yes,j6slwvw,t1_j6sl6pr

"Yea, and we did try and overpay. To the tune of 70 million pounds. That's already a drastic overpay. 

Ultimately, whatever way this shook out, people will look to fund fault with Edu. If he offered 85M and they still rejected it, people would still be criticising him for upsetting Brighton.",Arsenal,Yes,j6re9o2,t1_j6rds0p
The only issue they have is their midfield. They clearly need midfield revamp signing 2 or 3 and they are already set. And also they have one of the best managers in the world which Chelsea don not have atleast for now.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r67fd,t1_j6r5y80

"This is all just shades of 'why would saliba come back, why would he want another loan, he's ging to leave because we didn't give him a chance, arteta doesn't trust young players....

They just absolutely suck at getting a team to work together. They can spend all they want but the area of the pitch where they have the most talent is the attacking department (underperforming talent) and they‚Äôre actually weak in other areas - so what did they do?

over who? (in the first XI),Arsenal,Yes,j6sflgx,t1_j6sdwi1
"We all knew but we had no actual proof and lets be honest UEFA and especially the Bundesliga aren't going to slap Bayern down.

Despise that club probably more than anyone except Spurs, Chelsea, Man U and Barca.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w0pzc,t1_j6w0fot
Honestly think the Germans have just internalised the whole Bayern thing and just decided that the real prize is being 'fan owned' while just ignoring the utter corruption that is Bayern or just waving away criticism because they've got cheap tickets.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w04xw,t1_j6vyrof
"Being competitive with United, City, Liverpool and Arsenal isn't easy and requires near perfection. Spending helps obviously, but this isn't FM or FIFA. It guarantees nothing.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sng6b,t1_j6sn1hg
"Not every player will be good in the first 3-6 months of a move. Some of our greatest ever players took time to adapt.

Same for many other stars in the league now, like Rodri and Partey.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sn8ud,t1_j6sn1a3
"We've got three DM's and bought an extra one.

Cedric is our third choice RB and he's already had game timeWhile Saka, Marquinhos and Nelson have all played RW so far this season.

Yeah tha'ts because of injuries but injuries are a fact of life and more importantly for when Nelson does leave, Eddie, Jesus and Balogun can play out wide.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w4hth,t1_j6w3ztb
"Yeah ik, that‚Äôs why Chelski fans need to realize this kind of hotshot spending is probably not going to be the norm going forward next 2 seasons. Could be wrong but doubt it. They could continue this expenditure method if they keep getting CL and winning PLs and other trophies, success breeds profitability. That‚Äôs why I think the Kroenkes finally realized that and are now the type of owners we wanted ‚Äî ones that actually care and invest to win so success will bring profitable ROI. State owned clubs are another issue and disgrace imo.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vox88,t1_j6vob7b
"Top my head Napoli and Milan since I watch Serie A as well. The top 6 in prem probably don‚Äôt. Regardless this is my opinion and don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs a big deal. Like you said yourself, Cedric older and end of his career so doesn‚Äôt make sense to have him sitting around for him and the club.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tiifc,t1_j6tg1ga
Yeah because no other football team in the world has 3 strikers and the golden rule has to be 2. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if fans like you would be the first to slag Edu and Arteta why we let Balogun go and not relaxed him if we are ever down with both Eddie and Jesus.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tb25j,t1_j6t9u1k
Yeah okay mate that‚Äôs exactly what I said‚Ä¶,Arsenal,Yes,j6tajsb,t1_j6ta7s6
words need to have meaning,Arsenal,Yes,j6tflta,t1_j6te98c
"I was quite shocked by some of what was said about Martinelli. He had all the ingredients of a generational talent prior to injuries, and has been looking like an utter nightmare to play against all season *despite* those injuries.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ss0dc,t1_j6so7no
"I was happy Willock has been good and had that hot run of scoring 10 in 12 or whatever it was.

But Willock scored on something like ~65% of his shots. It was a rate well higher than Haaland.

Some of our fans were somehow convinced this was sustainable.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sok9p,t1_j6so7no
you make space for that level of talent. i mean seriously yeah we need a right winger,Arsenal,Yes,j6tvi8q,t1_j6tv91p
its okay to have more than one you know,Arsenal,Yes,j6tvrb6,t1_j6tv3c0
"We might have that money if we sell Balogun

Idk what the wage implications would be but around 150 m in dry powder + sales gives us a lot of cash to splash in the summer",Arsenal,Yes,j6viwxp,t1_j6vis89
You‚Äôre crazy lol,Arsenal,Yes,j6vnlfw,t1_j6vm1wr
Please show me evidence of Edu being good at selling,Arsenal,Yes,j6tfwjn,t1_j6tfkxz
"Liverpool and Chelsea regularly sell garbage for good money.

Wilock had like 8 goals and he only got 20m. Brewster haven't scored a PL goal in his life and he was sold for 30+ 

Gibbs-White barely played in the PL and was sold for 40m.

Actual good DOF can sell English talent well.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tgwxn,t1_j6tg4qv
"They can offload many players within the summer to increase their spending power. They have many ""star"" players like Sterling, Havertz, etc who need to go and can definitely bring in money. 

There is a rumour flying around this is why the reason why they submitted the ""wrong"" papers for Ziyech.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rlr1u,t1_j6rlive
"Chelsea has never been established as a team in that sense tho, no one actually plays for the badge at Chelsea but they still attain all the honours.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rlefc,t1_j6rkv7n
Missing out on Felix Mudryk and Caicedo is not miniscule. Especially when we all left summer knowing we needed a winger and midfielder. And knowing that the January market is a shit market for buyers. And knowing it would be compounded by WC inflation,Arsenal,Yes,j6r7kde,t1_j6r7dh0
Thank you. People on this sub have been so used to such a thin squad that they forgot what competition is,Arsenal,Yes,j6u3r48,t1_j6u364x
"More of a sideways move tbh. I might hate United and therefore all of their players but I don‚Äôt wish mental health issues on anyone, glad he recovered",Arsenal,Yes,j6u3wnt,t1_j6u2qdy
"They wouldn‚Äôt accept any permanent move for less than ¬£35m last summer, why would they sell for ¬£27m after this loan!? He also kept Tierney on the bench for multiple games last season, and was a instrumental in quite a few results last season. 

A Tierney transfer in the summer seems all but inevitable, and Nuno brings something to this squad that it currently lacks.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tp4hf,t1_j6tofd7
You‚Äôre saying gunnerblogs objective is to wind people up? LOL,Arsenal,Yes,j6r6dw4,t1_j6r5tfw
"Oh. That's silly and obviously not correct.

You can put Jesus on the wings and let Balogun be the backup 9,Arsenal,Yes,j6tzyx0,t1_j6tzs2b

[deleted],Arsenal,Yes,j6t8ktk,t1_j6t5qob
Nah he isn't good on the left.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tinsl,t1_j6thtkq
No he's not.  Maybe vs a washed Auba but compared to our current left side options he's not a palatable back up.  He doesn't play like a wide player.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tiaqm,t1_j6thtkq
"Their whole squad is aging. They‚Äôre declining and have no obvious successors. A midfield would help but that‚Äôs patching over the cracks. They need a proper overhaul. I have more faith in Klopp than Potter but the way things are going, Chelsea will eventually overtake Liverpool.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r8ubx,t1_j6r67fd
Been chasing a midfielder for a minimum of 3 windows,Arsenal,Yes,j6r90xv,t1_j6r8dni
Yes but the Caicedo nonsense was our fault. We were told in no uncertain terms he wasn't going anywhere with 3/4 days of the window left. We gambled that they were bluffing. We gambled wrong.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r8jqi,t1_j6r8dni
Forget the window of time we had. Clearly Jorginho was the backup plan long before we moved for Caicedo. Arteta has like the player for time. Things moved very quickly once the Caicedo deal fell through so it‚Äôs very unlikely that we hadn‚Äôt already planned to move for him once we couldn‚Äôt get our first choice.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rbvph,t1_j6r8dni
"No it does not

He signed that contract two years ago btw. A little bit has changed",Arsenal,Yes,j6uyz8u,t1_j6uy0az
"At the end of the day, it's the best kind of problem to have. And if it was Me, I'd use one of them to swap for a player in position of need. Like say, Rice for striker plus 10-20. But we need Rice next year, and i don't think anyone of us is ready to let either of Balogun and Nketiah so soon",Arsenal,Yes,j6vyaqc,t1_j6vxs8o
Im not upset with us selling him nor with us not buying him back. We couldve bought him before Milan bought him because we have a buyback clause.,Arsenal,Yes,j6vuiia,t1_j6vu64g
Lol fucking idiot,Arsenal,Yes,j6w3map,t1_j6w2uja
Well I still remember 19 Europa Final.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rbob9,t1_j6r5fee
"I can't believe anyone's watching anything Chelsea has done with anything other than disdain. That Enzo deal in and of itself is worthy of a deep dive just to see what actually happened. Actual total fee paid allegedly in the region of 200M. 

Once you peel back the sheen of shiny shiny new players, it's a particularly grim reality. There a house of cards in a room of fans at the minute.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t3440,t1_j6t1z4n
Oh oh.... Ziyech...of course. Funny af. I thought something happened to Omari and my comment was insensitive. Ziyech deal was fucking hilarious. That's what you get for going to Chelsea i suppose,Arsenal,Yes,j6w1fxc,t1_j6w0kll
Dennis Zakaria on a one year loan on deadline day and Palhinha for 15m,Arsenal,Yes,j6rj5pu,t1_j6ric3e
"Living in the past‚Ä¶ of 4 months ago? 

Also, it‚Äôs absolutely mental to look at our full squad and think that squad is fully capable of challenging for  titles year in, year out. If I‚Äôm living in the past, you‚Äôre living in dreamland expecting players to never dip out of form or pick up injuries.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rewnw,t1_j6red94
"Understood, my bad!",Arsenal,Yes,j6tdlcg,t1_j6tc4nq
"Yeah, which is why this stuff can still continue",Arsenal,Yes,j6r5uj1,t1_j6r5o1e
UEFA isn‚Äôt going to be under any meaningful pressure. This has been happening a long time and club opinions don‚Äôt dictate what UEFA does - money does.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r5vtr,t1_j6r5o1e
I came so see what you all thought of the Jorginho signing and stumbled across some hilariously poor takes,Arsenal,Yes,j6s8xwa,t1_j6s8go8
"That is the dream, but I‚Äôd get another attacker instead of Rice, and maybe the club can afford FDJ in two years.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tekv4,t1_j6te7ir
Well we‚Äôll never know,Arsenal,Yes,j6r8n7y,t1_j6r8hl2
Not if Real coming in with better package offer like Chelsea did with Mudryk,Arsenal,Yes,j6sjkqp,t1_j6sfk31
I'll give you a hint: not √òdegaard.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sftz2,t1_j6sflgx
"Right but, again, people's concerns aren't about this season.",Arsenal,Yes,j6snwyt,t1_j6sn8ud
"look the players you are mentioning. *Cedric*, who got a total of what? 90 minutes in 6 months? lol. complete non factor in the season. also he's gone

Marquinhos? 180 minutes or so? also gone

Nelson? even less i think?

three DMs? Lokonga is gone and Elneny prob out of the season too

all in all you've mentioned either youngster or older squad players. you simply do not maintain multiple top players of the same position, no team does, unless you got great youngsters coming",Arsenal,Yes,j6w81p9,t1_j6w4hth
"I don't think so.

Napoli's strikers are Osimhen and Simeone. Milan's strikers are Giroud and Origi. You can't count Zlatan. He was their second striker but he hasn't been playing since MAY. They had to sign Origi in the summer to fill the depth role. 

Clubs ONLY have 3 strikers in case of bad long term injuries. And as soon as that injury clears, they default back to 2. Case in point was Newcastle. They had Wilson, Isak and Wood. They'd have sold Wood but Wilson was injured and so was Isak. As soon as the other two were back, Newcastle gave up Wood to Forest.

About your Cedric point, it's even worse for a younger talent in need of minutes. That's why we let Lokonga go. Developing players need minutes. Balogun as third option would mean he only plays when Jesus and Eddie are out. That's just wrong for his development. Eddie was already starved for minutes. Now imagine the third option.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tm3vt,t1_j6tiifc
"you are incredibly thick.

Teams who play with 2 strikers formation, have 3 or more. Nobody else.

There is 0 chance of what you are saying to happen. I rather they cash in for him now, and put a buy back clause. You can't have 3 players for each position, it's impossible.",Arsenal,Yes,j6td3b7,t1_j6tb25j
"That‚Äôs why we get versatile players too though, Martinelli could potentially play there + who knows about ESR and Trossard as a false 9 if we‚Äôre in a pinch. 

We‚Äôre good at striker for now imo",Arsenal,Yes,j6tbw1u,t1_j6tajsb
"I can understand excitement, but football is always a longitudinal study. A bit like when I used to watch Quincy Owusu-Abeyie terrorise full backs in the league cup... about 3 times before he fell off like Dre after The Chronic (with no bounceback hit). Yet I thought at the time that he was going to rival CR7.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ssdxm,t1_j6sok9p

He‚Äôs going to get 400k at Madrid, United or City. 

We aren‚Äôt going near that",Arsenal,Yes,j6vu3tj,t1_j6viwxp
"Jude will be at least 150m. Young, English and possibly the most in demand U21 midfielder in all of Europe.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vj2kq,t1_j6viwxp
25 mil for willock,Arsenal,Yes,j6tgf59,t1_j6tfwjn
"How would keeping Ziyech at the club help?  His value is more likely to go up at PSG than staying at Chelsea.

Well we had about ¬£150mill on paper of dead wood yet got about ¬£50mill in total for them so perhaps they raise some money but I image they already need at least 50% of it to cover the players they have already bought.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rlzzk,t1_j6rlr1u
"It is minuscule, our first XI is the best XI in the league. Paying outrageous sums for players who won‚Äôt start most likely is just wild, and the deals were all incredibly complex because like you said January is terrible.


I would‚Äôve loved a winger in the summer but for whatever reason it wasn‚Äôt feasible or they learned during the season the position was a higher priory than they thought and they adapted- which is just objectively smart like",Arsenal,Yes,j6r7swz,t1_j6r7kde
"I see what you're getting at, but you won't find much luck bridging that gap for people on here. It's certainly possible, but what Tierney offers in defensive solidity is yet to be matched by Nuno. 

I'd feel more comfortable with Tierney as option 2 behind Zinchenko. But Nuno's ceiling is significantly higher and I do love an agent of chaos.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tpvwm,t1_j6tp4hf
"Can't argue with the last part. I don't particularly rate Tierney either though, so Nuno benching him is no great feat. He does offer something different though I suppose. We'll see. He's definitely better in offensive areas than Tierney.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tpsgf,t1_j6tp4hf

Bruv edu convinced balogun to stay in the first place when he had 6 months left on the contract. If you genuinely think he could only sell him for 16m when he's playing this good then you might just be one of the most deluded sods I've seen on this subreddit,Arsenal,Yes,j6tkk7i,t1_j6tjjym

"So basically a player would move clubs once 51% ownership is reached?

but to do that in the scenario the player and agent has to forfeit, albeit they are paid for their shares, and then they end up owned by two clubs.

Seems a colossal waste of time.  And why would Brighton sell part of their shares to get stuck with part of a player they don't want.  Their shares devalue because they have to sell them otherwise they cant reinvest in their squad.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ta1za,t1_j6t8ktk
"How does that even work? if Arsenal buys Caicedo's %, what will he have at Arsenal?

700mill of players over 8 years is still hitting the FFP allowance by 90mill a year.  Then they have all the existing pre Boehly players that were still being split over their contracts, and then they'd add any new ones.

If you kept buying players for the prices they have at some point any profit the club makes is only setting off these costs so under FFP you wouldn't be able to spend the money, even if you had it in the bank, on new players.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rnc52,t1_j6rmdi3
">	fortunate they failed and had to get Plan Bs.


So maybe we should trust in their ability to pivot to other signings, if only we had a very recent history of doing that extremely well.

"If we had Zakaria the fanbase would be moaning about a needless transfer who was 'killing Lokonga' or 'not giving Elneny chances when he's better against big teams' and also the good old 'why didn't we sign a proper big player instead'.

Palhinha was signed before Elneny got injured. Again, Elneny was trusted - he did well when slotted into the lineup the previous season, it's fairly understandable. If Palhinha had been available later on, sure, but he wasn't, so it's a moot point.
