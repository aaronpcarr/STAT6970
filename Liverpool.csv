My absolute favorite moment from yesterdays match was when that washed up Lemina guy was dancing around our players just outside his own box and Bajcetic went flying in with a slide tackle to win the ball back. That kids got more tenacity and grit in him than most of our senior players.,Liverpool,No,j7abeve,t3_10u5d54

Klopp snapping at Pearce seems to me it‚Äôs not only about Pearce‚Äôs articles. Pearce has been in many press conferences but he hasn‚Äôt snapped at him. The problems on the pitch and the problems in the background surely have to be taking their toll on him?,Liverpool,No,j7a9sl2,t3_10u5d54

"I actually would like to know what the club did over the winter break for us to come back looking so much worse

We weren't perfect but we actually were winning some games here and there, and scoring goals

Wtf happened over the winter break???

We don't even look like we are capable of winning games at this point, let alone actually score a goal

Ffs our highest goalscorer since the new year is a Leicester defender 

There must be something going on behind the scenes I assume, the club is very toxic currently and feels like either Klopp or FSG will have to leave for things to get better again",Liverpool,No,j7bcrc9,t3_10u5d54

FSG have also held preliminary talks with other interested parties including the Qatar Investment Authority.

"My wife sometimes randomly used to watch matches with me whenever she had time on weekends. She is a total novice when it comes to any sport and has no idea about all the sports. Last night was the first time when she sat down to watch a Liverpool game with me this season. Within first minute she asks me why does everything look to messy, Liverpool used to look so organised since the first minute. After 15 minutes, she said this looks painful to watch and left.

Now we all know the transfer issues and have beaten that drum enough. But in the end, the players on the pitch should be doing better and I don‚Äôt understand what kind of tactics Klopp wants to implement. We brought Nunez who forced a total change in style. Our wingers don‚Äôt operate in half spaces anymore but instead hug the touchline all the time. Then after the world cup, he went back to using the false nine for better pressing and defence from the front. But last night he went back to Nunez as a striker. I don‚Äôt see any passing triangles, any structured movements to open spaces. And it seems like Klopp is unable to figure out what will work right now.",Liverpool,No,j7a5a46,t3_10u5d54

"The Alex Miller article also states that FSG will try to use the Manchester United sale to price us up even more.

In the past 12 months, FSG have:

Removed Mike Gordon behind the scenes to facilitate a non-existent takeover.

Hung Klopp out to dry with minimal backing and has spent less than the majority of Premier League clubs.

Priced out virtually every consortium that has had interest due to their ridiculous demands.

Used the club's income to pay off their infrastructure loans instead of using it to fund transfers.

Clearly have not helped us establish our ongoing problems with recruitment, establishing roles within that, have not found a replacement for Julian Ward thus far. As well as letting our top data analyst leave without a replacement.

And now are willing to gain 'strategic partnerships' with Redbird or whoever else, to further fill their pockets.

"That win against city in the community shield at the start of the season feels like years ago. I genuinely don‚Äôt understand what happened in between that game and the Fulham game. In the community shield game we looked like normal Liverpool, everyone was playing well and we had so much energy. Then we play Fulham and everyone‚Äôs form went to shit and it seems like half our players can‚Äôt run anymore.

"I think the weirdest drop off for me this season has been how abysmal we now are at set pieces.

"If we had truly gone out and aimed to win the league at any point then we'd have never experienced 20-21 and 22-23. The fact is we were always happy to cruise to a comfortable CL finish and 19-20 was a happy accident which happened in spite of FSG's strategy, not because of it.

When you're in a competitive environment you always need to aim higher and try to innovate and push your opposition. Resting on your laurels will only lead to downfall when there are a handful of clubs aiming to take your perch.

Wouldn't be surprised if that's also a big cause of our mentality issues, it's hard for players to feel motivated when the club doesn't appear to be pushing to win trophies. People like to be in a forward-thinking environment with room for personal and collective growth, not in a team whose primary aim is to cling onto second place. 

Right now all of the Arsenal, Utd and Newcastle players are looking forward to what they're going to accomplish in the future, we just don't have that. We're looking at what we accomplished in the past.",Liverpool,No,j7arhmz,t3_10u5d54

"The last match was the final cry for help for this team, a rebuild is the necessity of the hour.

Idk which players can fix this situation, but I think everyone is sure about which players shouldn't be continuing next season with the club.

Ox, Keita, Fab, Hendo, Milner, Matip, Williams, Rhys need to be offloaded asap.

Problem is except for Gomez and maybe Fab I don't think we can expect any decent amount in transfer value for the rest. So we will need major investment otherwise we're going to be looking at more of this come next season. These players are completely checked out and it's not healthy to keep them on despite the consistently mediocre performances. The motivation levels of the new players also seems to be impacted because of the lack of effort they're seeing on the pitch from the pensioners.",Liverpool,No,j7aztui,t3_10u5d54
Only thing that‚Äôs actually worked this season was the tactics we played against City in the league.  A bit less typical of a Klopp side but surely it‚Äôs worth trying again? Mindlessly continuing with 4-3-3 is insane,Liverpool,No,j7bct6d,t3_10u5d54

Got downvoted for saying Robbo should've done better for the second and third goal. I sometimes wonder whether people here even watch the game or do they just camp here to downvote any criticism directed towards our players.

The Brentford 3-3 where a newly promoted team could easily beat our press and slice us open. Obviously the UCL final‚Ä¶

"Discussion about Liverpool's latest losses

Here is a comment i wrote in one of Tifo's videos about Liverpool: 

""The true loss of this Liverpool's side is honestly Henderson. When we were in our hay day he was the silent engine in our team, helping Salah up front, covering for Trent when there's a counter attack and overrall his workrate is what made him great. Now, he is just past his prime and we see the effects of that on our team, Salah isolated, Trent getting butchured alive in that right flank .. etc. That's why i'm convinced if we find some midfielders with very high workrate and intensity, we will get back to the competition, but we didn't in the transfer market this january so the blame will land of FSG .. greedy people.""

That aside, i think the system we play currently isn't effective when the midfield is lacking that press, so basically we are playing against ourselves with our current system .. that's why we are conceding so many goals.",Liverpool,No,j7bpf3s,t3_10u5d54

Meanwhile, the net spending hasn't noticeably changed recently and we're still buying expensive players. Even the argument of needing to buy to sell is flawed when you remember we bought Diaz before his incumbent Man√© left the club. If you look at that, why we didn't do that with the midfield wouldn't be FSG's fault. Someone else is making that decision.

I see a lot of people just straight up saying that the players don't care anymore, or Klopp is unable to switch tactics.

"So I just rewatched the 3 goals and here's my take.

Goal 1:  Gomez gets pulled out of position.  Robbo fills in at CB.  Robbo sees Gomez getting back into position and slides back to LB prematurely leaving a big hole.  Matip slides over as cover.  Makes of a mess of it.  OG Matip.  Big picture, I'd say this falls on Robbo and Matip.  Robbo didn't wait for Gomez to fill in and Matip made a mess of a fairly simple defensive phase.

Goal 2:  This one's a big mess frankly.  Under hit free kick lands Acuna, who Robbo is marking.  The ball rolls to the end line and rather than Robbo follow the ball and man, he elects to fall back into his zone.  Baj and Nunez are also out of position at this point where they find themselves outside the 18 yard box despite everyone else being in it.  Both make moves to fill in but Baj ends up in no-mans land to some degree.  Keita attempts to challenge the ball but is not able to get there in time.  It's a fairly shit cross right to Gomez's head.  He elects to head it back into play rather than out of play.  Ali also gets pulled out by this cross.  Miscommunication?  Hard to say, but Ali is now way off his line and scrambling.  The ball bounces around just outside the goal and Dawson goes to the ball, while Trent, who has man marked Dawson this entire set pieces, decides at this moment to run away from Dawson to try to end up at the near post, but not actually near it.  Dawson ends up burying it.

This goal is really annoying because so many little things were done wrong.  Robbo didn't go to the ball, but you could blame that on Baj and Nunez not being in good positions.  Gomez not putting the ball out or letting Ali take it could be down to bad communication.  But in the end, I'm going to have to blame Trent for this one.  Once again, his defensive instincts let him down.  If he stays with his man and does his job, he puts a tackle or block on Dawson.

Goal 3:  Problem #1 is Gomez and Baj losing the ball cheaply.  But it's 70 yards from goal so while many will go on about that, I have a problem blaming players losing the ball 70 yards from goal for conceding.  For me, this goal is on Thiago.  He's the deepest midfield player.  He has 20 yards on Neves, who is not exactly a speedster, but Thiago doesn't get back, doesn't cut the angle for the pass, and allows Neves to make a simple run for an easy goal.  All Neves did was run hard.  We made it easy for him.

I'm sure many won't agree with my analysis.  Most will want to blame Gomez, and don't get me wrong, he's not playing well at all, but if I had to point the finger for each goal, I'd go with Robbo, Trent, and Thiago.",Liverpool,No,j7ad30r,t3_10u5d54

Now, I think he need to focus back  on defend first until VVD and Konate back. If he worried about creativity using 442 formation, maybe put Trent on the RM, and Gakpo in LM.

"I feel like the problem is lack of leadership on the field. When opposition scores a goal, or outplay the team, most players shrug it off like it wasn't their fault, ""whatever"" little ownership of the situation.

Virgil hasn't had a super season, but you can see he cares, and him and Henderson give an earful and get players to wake up. They have leader personalities. I have no clue what happened to Henderson, maybe burnt out?

Now who's doing taking the leader role? Salahs personality isn't that type, Robbo is probably not taken too serious because he's a jester off field. Ali is the only one that I see shouting at players, but even he is too polite.

Just look at the team, whos a leader there... Nunez is still the new kid and is dealing with his internal demons, Keita is very shy, Tiago is love plus looses possession so much he probably thinks he better keep quiet, whos left... Matip? Lol. Trent is somehow perceived still like a kid, Fabinho probably wishes no one noticed hes on the field.

I've got less and less hope for a quick-fix, patch-work type operation. I want the club to accept the situation we're in with our spine aging and our frequent injuries, and give ourselves a few transfer windows to sort the squad and backroom staffing out: with Klopp leading the rebuild, hopefully provided enough funds to get some good players in.

"I think Liverpool might have reasonably believed this season would again be them v City, but then City signed Haaland and many people felt that City had effectively won the title. Short of Liverpool equally upgrading by signing someone like Mbappe, I can see why Liverpool may have started the season with a sense of futility, which on top of the disappointment of last season plus a too-short summer break means the belief has gone. Which results in subpar performances which further confirm the futility of the challenge to City. 

Other teams haven't been subject to the depression Liverpool have fallen into as no-one else was realistically expecting to challenge City for the title anyway this season - the other top team's goal was for the other 2 or 3 CL spots that would be up for grabs. Had Liverpool started the season with the goal being ""top 4"" it would have been admitting defeat from the off, but the alternative would be to believe they could overtake a City side that now had Haaland. And I don't think they believed they could.

I'm absolutely for giving Klopp that opportunity, I think he's capable of pulling it off, and reckon it's only rarely happened before because of owner and fan impatience resulting in premature sackings.

This is fucking funny.

For weeks SOS has been accused of racism because they ""never said anything when the sale was first announced"" and only took action once Qatar was involved. That's been the single narrative every anti-SOS brigade has led with. Yet a Qatar bid hasn't made the front pages at all so far. It barely makes more than a sentence in other stories, usually about United's sale.

Totally agree. He's been poor. The whole ""agent of chaos"" thing is one of the most cringe things I've heard. He's absolutely allowed time, but let's face it, he's been shit so far.",Liverpool,Yes,j7blobv,t1_j7bk6b9
"Absolutely. I don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs a ‚Äúproject,‚Äù he should absolutely be finishing some of these shots already at his age and price tag.

"There‚Äôs valid criticism of his conversion rate so far but people need to realize the likelihood of it remaining that low is incredibly unlikely. Even if Darwin is a below average finisher over the next 3-4 seasons, the amount of XG he generates alone will mean he‚Äôs gonna still be scoring a lot of goals

He had the highest non penalty conversion rate of any forward in top 5 European leagues last season with 30.8%. You don‚Äôt just go from that to 5.8% this season and not bounce back a bit. It‚Äôll even itself out. Finishing is kind of random like that",Liverpool,Yes,j7bpgso,t1_j7bk6b9

"I‚Äôm honestly just waiting to make a judgement of him next season, same with Gakpo.

"Most likely. That what I thought first. This not a first time he mixed it up with someone else. But he apologizes for the mistake in pc before. Poor Jimbo, twitter already label him FSG ass kisser now they think Klopp really hate him.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aqfu7,t1_j7apl9x

This is 100% facts. If they have half a brain they'll be taking their 3 billion profit and running. If they dare let red ball invest then they are giving up so much money as we deteriorate. Surely as business men they know this. The only way they think it's worth it is if they try to get the super league started again.

Get used to this because it won‚Äôt change for a while. Will get worse because other teams are getting much stronger.,Liverpool,Yes,j7a9vab,t1_j7a9den
"I think we need a formation or style of play change. It‚Äôs clear they continue to try play the 4-3-3 pressing football but they can‚Äôt (or won‚Äôt?) anymore so now that needs to change. Just beating a dead horse with a stick now, hoping today will be the day they show up and it clicks. It‚Äôs not going to do now tactics need to change. 

 Not sure how they get their confidence back. A convincing win? Doubt that‚Äôs going to happen, even if we win, it‚Äôll be a grind. 75% of the players don‚Äôt look like they want to be on the pitch at all so how does one change that? Klopp can only try motivate them so much before they need to take things into their own hands and get their heads out of their asses and put in a proper shift.

One thing about Henderson, he may not have been the best, but he was always running and motivating, yelling encouragement on the pitch  and that seems gone now. Even when he‚Äôs playing, it doesn‚Äôt seem like they‚Äôre doing any of that anymore. It doesn‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre backing each other, celebrating small things. When goals are scored, they don‚Äôt even celebrate in an excited way. That goal against wolves that Nunez scored was so incredible but everyone half-heartedly jogged to him. Where is the passionate running to your teammates? They need to take responsibility now and get the team back to feeling like a team who supports each other.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aa22w,t1_j7a9den
"We won't be in Europe next year (certainly not big cup). Just accept it now and save the stress.

A team that gets battered by Wolves and Brentford isn't going to make a late surge up the table. Any team can lose the odd game. But we're getting outplayed by everyone.

Even Leicester had to chuck the goal in their own net twice to give us a chance.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aghcf,t1_j7a9den
Nothing changes imo.,Liverpool,Yes,j7a9icn,t1_j7a9den
"That first season we finished top 4 with Klopp. We finished the season playing a diamond with Studge up top and dragged ourselves over the finish line (with a world class Coutinho no less).

Looks like it. He might get it wrong sometimes but I like how baldy isn‚Äôt afraid to change things up and experiment with formations/tactics. I wish we would do the same smh.,Liverpool,Yes,j7biokt,t1_j7bi2xi
"Okay I went and checked the heatmaps from the 2018 season they all are more or less similar so I don't get your overall point, perhaps he is cutting in more from right than usual but that can be due to his role being more tailored to the teams needs over the years and diminishing returns from him as he is in his 30s, can't expect the same influence he had on the game like he used to do earlier.

But he has plenty of presence in the box still and isn't totally isolated on the right. Also you are looking at the heat map of half a season and comparing it to a full season, but still I don't see any drastic difference in tactics or instructions.

There is more to life and more to the city than the football club right now, people can‚Äôt afford to eat due to soaring coast of living and stagnated salaries.

I do agree he should be dropped and sold in the summer but there was a time at the start of the 18/19 season where he was unplayable. Him and VVD couldn‚Äôt be beaten so there‚Äôs clearly a top class player in there but it seems that injuries have ruined him,Liverpool,Yes,j7agmzw,t1_j7ag151
"His strength is one on one defending. So during 2018-2020, our midfield was strong and not much passed through the middle, only passes played were long balls to isolated attackers. Gomez was good as dealing with those situations. But when the midfield is open and things are moving in front of him, he gets lost. He can‚Äôt read the game, cannot hold the offside line and totally gets lost. I still want him around as a 4th choice defender and a back up at the right back position. He also takes up a homegrown spot. But we should not expect much from him.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aiz46,t1_j7ag151

So many of them aren‚Äôt going in for tackles, losing the ball, waiting for passes to come to them instead of meeting them, letting them be intercepted.

Pure and utter delusion to point the finger at anyone but Gomez for their 2nd goal. He's just a completely brain-dead footballer that would be in the Championship by now if he didn't get lucky with VVD hand holding him for the last few years.,Liverpool,Yes,j7afb2y,t1_j7ad30r
"Fair points across the board but there is absolutely no way the blame for that second goal should lie anywhere but Gomez.

You talk about Trent's defensive instincts but in that second where Gomez has to make a decision he makes the wrong one. It's got nothing to do with communication. Noone needs to be telling him anything. It's at most the second phase of play of an attacking freekick, he knows for a fact there are going to be Wolves players in the middle of the area - even if he can't see them. It shouldn't even come into his mind to make the decision he did, yet here we are.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aerk2,t1_j7ad30r
"In reality Matip, Thiago, Bajcetic, Gakpo, Robertson, all had hideous games yesterday. Gomez was fine, actually trying to play like a Liverpool player attacking the game when he could, defending with guts, but he's a whipping boy on this sub because people stan Matip and latch on to English players to hate. Good comment.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ahx9k,t1_j7ad30r
All depends on the how they sell it to him if they are selling it as you are going to have the team rebuilt around him I think yes,Liverpool,Yes,j7avjqq,t1_j7aumsn
"No obviously not. Joining perennial underdogs and what ifs, where you're expected to carry the team week in-week out, where your legs are run into the ground because you don't have competent back ups, and where a couple of weeks of bad form due to all of these factors means that the club journos and fan groups are instructed to write articles about how you have no desire and you can't escape criticism from what ultimately stems from mismanagement at the top.",Liverpool,Yes,j7axfeh,t1_j7aumsn
"No way, with our current squad, owners situation, ambitions showed by owners AND fans. And when RM and ManCity is interested too, with better situation at every department, and better paycheck.",Liverpool,Yes,j7avcz8,t1_j7aumsn
"IMO they are selling that the next rebuild will be building the team around him, basically giving him the keys to the castle. Much like City is rebuilding around Haaland (changed systems pep has used for years to suit him etc). Certain guarantees of investment in the squad as well so it‚Äôs not him along with 5 aging/ subpar midfielders and he‚Äôs expecting to make magic. Future captain, legacy, ‚Äúthis means more‚Äù, Klopp etc 

I think even if this season was going the way it is, it wouldn‚Äôt have stopped him. However, the turmoil BTS is a massive red flag. I think his family are likely looking at it (including how toxic the fanbase has become) and have decided it‚Äôs too risky for his future. BTS is too shaky, obviously a big mess with ward and Graham leaving, all the rumours of unrest between members of the coaching staff etc, the owners. They wouldn‚Äôt want to risk his development. 

Unfortunately I think the ship has sailed because of it.",Liverpool,Yes,j7awul9,t1_j7aumsn

Just come out and speak and be honest then. That‚Äôs what annoys me. Klopps in a position only a couple managers have ever been in where as bad as it gets the fans would never want him out. Which makes him more powerful than the owners. So why not come out and be honest about the state of the squad?,Liverpool,Yes,j7b0dcc,t1_j7ayokq
"Gakpo played really well yesterday, looked much better on the left wing than through the center. Obviously, the bar is pretty low for the team at the moment, but he was one of the few bright sparks for the start of the second half",Liverpool,Yes,j7a8z4h,t1_j7a5mh9

"I despise Man City and Haaland, but seriously he has fucking 25 in 20. He has not made them worse.

That's before you even look at the fact Jesus has fallen off

EDIT: Carragher, the wank, agrees with you to be fair:

'City are lesser team with Haaland in'
FT: Spurs 1-0 Man City

Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher: ""Manchester City now, not because of Erling Haaland, we can see they‚Äôre a different team but, they‚Äôve scored exactly the same amount of goals.

""He‚Äôs scored 25 Premier League goals, but Manchester City as a team have still scored the same amount of goals, but they‚Äôve conceded more goals. It‚Äôs far easier to counter-attack them as well, so they‚Äôre a different team and a lesser team with Erling Haaland in the team, but it‚Äôs not his fault.

""We‚Äôre not seeing the full package of what this player can do because of the team he has gone to.""",Liverpool,Yes,j7c5g6n,t1_j7c4yiv
Errr what ü§£,Liverpool,Yes,j7da95p,t1_j7d8inv
Disagree I think his movement is brilliant and his linkup play is clearly far better than Mo or Darwin‚Äôs. I think he‚Äôs a nice backup for Diaz and when he has an actual team around him he‚Äôll start scoring,Liverpool,Yes,j7afaxo,t1_j7acvgr
I don‚Äôt get this. The kids not ready. Normal Klopp treatment.,Liverpool,Yes,j7afvxb,t1_j7af1rj
"Halaaand has scored over 20 goals, think it‚Äôs more the fact they‚Äôve got a centre back pairing of Nathan Ake and akanji tbf if Nunez scored the amount halaand has we wouldn‚Äôt be as shit as we are",Liverpool,Yes,j7c7lfv,t1_j7c6pp8
"I think people idealize gulf ownership as it‚Äôll bring money, new signings, etc‚Ä¶ but people seem to be blinded by the fact there are some serious human rights allegations against them. Keep in mind that our shirt‚Äôs got AXA, Standard Chartered and Nike slapped right on it and all 3 are sussy as fuck. Nobody‚Äôs on a moral high ground in this day and age.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ax8r8,t1_j7avsik
"I'd take Qatari owners over these vulture fund capitalists that are destroying the club...

Forget about your romantic notion of a modern socialist football club. It won't ever happen. That dream died long ago. We are living in the era of late stage capitalism where everything is tied to profit..

You don't like what modern football has become then stop following the premier league.

Just give us the Qataris over these penny pinchers we have at the helm. I don't want this club to go through another thirty years in the wilderness. Once he leaves, we won't ever find another saviour like Klopp...

Wake up people. Questionable foreign ownership is inevitable so why wait?",Liverpool,Yes,j7b976r,t1_j7avsik
What Qatari ownership? When did people start taking rumours on twitter as facts. What's your opinion about the latest rumours that Red bird might be interested in buying more Liverpool shares?,Liverpool,Yes,j7awunp,t1_j7avsik
Because no one is going to pay realistically 4 Billion for us as the FSG are playing hardball. Fans are caught up between FSG staying or Qatar and some fans would rather choose the less shittier options..,Liverpool,Yes,j7awpkm,t1_j7avsik
The 'out of form' bit is not even close to be comparable between the two clubs.,Liverpool,Yes,j7bm2rd,t1_j7bl3si
"Madrid‚Äôs out of form = second with a 5 points gap. Still in contention to win the league if they fix up.

Liverpool‚Äôs = closer to relegation than top 4",Liverpool,Yes,j7bletj,t1_j7bl3si
"Him being fantastic doesn't mean he is fit for City. They literally had to change their playstyle for him. They looked much more predictable with him. 

Look at Ronaldo last season. He scored a lot but United were much worse.",Liverpool,Yes,j7c5qo5,t1_j7c4phc
Gakpo did well yesterday. There were other problems other than him yesterday.,Liverpool,Yes,j7bg6vo,t1_j7bekbi
Gakpo should be miles ahead of Ox on the pecking order. Klopp‚Äôs loyalty to Robbo when Kostas has performed time and time again is just absurd.,Liverpool,Yes,j7bh3yz,t1_j7bekbi
Something is going on behind the scenes which we don't know about. Pearce is a FSG mouthpiece,Liverpool,Yes,j7afw89,t1_j7afn28
"People are angry about him being too pro-fsg.

I found him smug and ""holier-than-thou"" this summer branding fans fake for not believing we had done enough.

"This is what's really frustrating. Eriksen got injured and United got a decent midfielder in on loan in no time. We spent all of summer doing nothing about midfield then got another injury prone midfielder who wasn't good enough anyway in on loan and he inevitably got injured straight away.

"i see people constantly saying the fan base gives him a free pass but thats not what i see here... People actually do say he fucked up, and yeah he fucked up big time. However with all the accomplishments he has made here we know he is still the right man to fix all this mess, eventually.

"Can‚Äôt use that reason when they are literally the different team in Europe. What they did against all 4 teams in the knock out rounds last year was unbelievable really. 

We can turn it on in single games still though we‚Äôve done it against city twice this season. Hopefully Jota and VVD are back as well. I‚Äôm not totally pessimistic about it. But the reason you‚Äôve given is invalid haha",Liverpool,Yes,j7bcm1t,t1_j7baw0q
"i have a hard time figuring how can this team just ""turn it on"", also madrid can be the shittiest it ever been and still go and in a champions league, that being said, if we setup similar to how we did earlier this season against city we can do something",Liverpool,Yes,j7bc4jw,t1_j7baw0q

No RM always pull something out of the bag in the CL no matter how badly they play.,Liverpool,Yes,j7bh8ww,t1_j7baw0q
"Even this season I‚Äôll give Real a 50% chance of winning the CL. Every team in contention of winning are having a bad season (not as much as us). Bayern and City are shaky.

"Man√© wanted to leave, why would we keep the player that wants to leave? Also let‚Äôs not act like Man√© hasn‚Äôt declined, he‚Äôs been poor by his standards for Bayern. That period after AFCON was just a purple patch 

If you‚Äôre going to use stats then don‚Äôt lie to suit your agenda. Jesus has 5 goals in all comps, Nunez has 10. Idk how you can say we didn‚Äôt replace Man√©, we replaced him with Diaz who ended up being so good that he forced Man√© out the left wing position.

The rest of your points are valid",Liverpool,Yes,j7afzjy,t1_j7af7za
"It's just this sub you're talking about, which operates more by the rules of an online fandom than a football support. 

Players like Nunez, Matip, Keita, get latched on to like kooky side characters in an anime or off-meta heroes in a videogame, because that's the cultural context for the mainstream of opinion on the sub, that's the shared experience of cultural value and pleasure people are coming from, much more so than from football itself. 

So don't worry about it. It's not like the fans here are going down Anfield and booing every time Henderson touches the ball while singing songs demanding that Keita is made captain and given a role as playmaker. Maybe they would if they went to a game but they don't do they?

It's all very abstract. So don't worry about it. People are stanning their favourite characters for clout and memes, not making informed arguments about the value of this or that player to this or that system. 

Your post is the same, ranting about goals, creativity and assists from midfield. Like, in the real world everyone knows we don't play that way. It doesn't matter who the midfielders are, they are there to play key passes not get assists. When a player does get played in midfield and gets a couple of goals and creates, in Harvey Elliott, the Thiago stans in here have to attack him because it makes their hero look bad.

So it's just an abstract, otherworldly internet opinion about internet arguments that also don't really connect directly with reality. So there's no use getting all spiteful about it, it is what it is. When it's not fun to be here, just don't be.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ah57t,t1_j7af7za

He came back from the AFCON alot better and I think the new role as a centre forward helped but still wasn‚Äôt peak Mane which is understandable.

In 2021 - Fresh legs in midfield as Thiago is injury prone, Milner is ancient, Hendo is aging, Naby and Ox are clearly unreliable. Maybe a new forward to try and shift the underperforming Mane and Firmino.

Schar maybe, he would have only had a year left on his contract. Other then that not much to do that we didn't IRL. Maybe Soucek or Hojberg, if they're willing to be rotation rather than starters.

"He's done an Ozil. Got a new contract that he's set for life on and is phoning in performances every week because he knows he's virtually undroppable given his extortionate wages. 

He's not been the same since the AFCON loss, to be honest.",Liverpool,Yes,j7akjq2,t1_j7agku4
"The last one bought him his new yacht, this one would buy John Henry his new NBA team",Liverpool,Yes,j7aflox,t1_j7ach8n
Believe it or not we make a lot of money for FSG.,Liverpool,Yes,j7acuyf,t1_j7aci2h
They're sniffing round an NFL franchise apparently they need to sell something in their portfolio to fund that allegedly. We're the obvious asset.,Liverpool,Yes,j7apfrx,t1_j7amuf8
Why would that make sense though?,Liverpool,Yes,j7angq6,t1_j7amuf8
"True that as well. Reporters spoke heavily in the summer that the money was there. That‚Äôs why there were heavy reports about Nunes. However as we all know, Klopp had that interview saying we have all types of midfielders available. Now look at us",Liverpool,Yes,j7cjzor,t1_j7cjqr8
Probably because no one has a clue if it‚Äôs actually true?  You keep saying like that it‚Äôs 100% true when no one outside the club‚Äôs accountants will have any idea if it is.,Liverpool,Yes,j7dfxxg,t1_j7cjqr8
That's the spirit.,Liverpool,Yes,j7ba1on,t1_j7b9oao
I'd love to be able to keep the faith at this point but I'm not even kidding when I say that they blow us away in our current form. I can see this one getting ugly unless Bajcetic turns into prone Busquets.,Liverpool,Yes,j7ba3gv,t1_j7b9oao
Somehow this gets forgotten all the time. They were nothing special before we got ourselves a world class manager.,Liverpool,Yes,j7b7qij,t1_j7b0wc4
"Klopp is a human. If he is getting stressed and losing sleep over the state of the club/squad, pressure from the media. He might wake up 1 day and say maybe this job is not for me anymore.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ayc6n,t1_j7ay0la
"Honestly, because I have no hope that we're going to turn this around and start winning. We haven't had a big signing to inject some hope like Diaz last season, there is no one that is going to come back from injury and relight a fire for us 

I could see us just keep losing for the foreseeable and at some point even if none of the fans are calling for it a manager's position becomes untenable",Liverpool,Yes,j7ayecg,t1_j7ay0la
"Are you paying attention this season...

We are free-falling with no end in sight. It will get worse for Klopp. We are not improving - I don't see a way we can turn this around. 

Zero investment has given us zero chance of rescuing the season. We have given up. 

I have no doubt we will finish in the bottom half this season, closer to relegation than a top 4 place. Remarkably, even worse than Utd during their peak banter era. 

Not only that, there has been a mass exodus at the club. Almost every key department has been affected. From top to bottom - we are in ruins.

Klopp will either walk or get sacked. Pick your poison. The writing is on the wall I'm afraid, we're deluding ourselves thinking otherwise. 

Had the fans or Klopp protested the lack of investment in the squad over the years than maybe we wouldn't be in this position. Yet, here we are, destined for another thirty years in the wilderness. Ugh. 

Liverpool FC will never dominate like they did in the 70/80s again unless we get rich owners. Till then, we continue with our inferiority complex - third richest club in world football, most successful English club in history and we act like we are Spurs. Embarrassing.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b7zie,t1_j7ay0la
isn't it wolves at home,Liverpool,Yes,j7blrsx,t1_j7bkzh8
Always had small squads‚Ä¶Peps thing,Liverpool,Yes,j7bxl4l,t1_j7bvcvx
"Exactly, that 500m investment into the FSG group last time. Zero of it went to our club. Times are looking dire and I don't want two sets of parasites attached to this club, sucking it dry.",Liverpool,Yes,j7c0ixg,t1_j7c06c9
Matip has a year left on his contract and Gomez is homegrown,Liverpool,Yes,j7b09l9,t1_j7b034z
"All for Milner to go into coaching, he's a proper mentor.

Fab and Hendo have been utter shite tho, not sure how you think they're ever regaining their form for more than 2 games in a row at this point.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b2bra,t1_j7b1q59
"Hendo will probably stay because he‚Äôs a leader, homegrown and no one else in world football would want to take him. Fab can definitely go though, this may be the last summer where we can get a decent fee for him",Liverpool,Yes,j7b3ze4,t1_j7b1q59
Firmino üîë,Liverpool,Yes,j7bf5r3,t1_j7beqwg
"Haha well she's not wrong. Our defenders really need a shake up. But whats equally amusing is that how can all of our defenders, barring maybe Konate, has suddenly just fallen off.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aazob,t1_j7aaonk
"I played some fifa after the match to try and enjoy football in some way, my girlfriend was to the side knitting and she heard the Fifa commentator say ""wow the fans will enjoy that"" or something along those lines. She laughs going ""that's can't be the Liverpool match that's for sure"" she at least gets my Liverpool support and pain haha",Liverpool,Yes,j7aazdn,t1_j7aaonk
"Kid hasn‚Äôt even made the bench lately, which is mind boggling, considering we need a spark every match. Klopp thinks he‚Äôs subbing in for consistency but those players haven‚Äôt been consistent nor impactful.",Liverpool,Yes,j7c4twa,t1_j7c0sec
Yeah it needs to end now. We are in a decline currently. I think the boss can pull us out of it and salvage something get us on the up again. But he needs backing in the summer.,Liverpool,Yes,j7apkre,t1_j7amlc9
"I agree, but I really can't get myself to turn on him when the whole team and club looks terrible and dysfunctional. Even Salah looks like a championship level player.



He should have put away some of his chances yes, but the whole team is dysfunctional and I really believe we are not utilizing him to the full potential.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aaum5,t1_j7aabb1
"He had our best chance of the entire game, if that was Haaland he scores that 10 times out of 10",Liverpool,Yes,j7aepcl,t1_j7a9xn5
Haha hilarious... considering he has the same goals per 90 as Salah and is our second highest goalscorer this season...,Liverpool,Yes,j7aaf3n,t1_j7a9g5b
He‚Äôs 23,Liverpool,Yes,j7ah9g4,t1_j7a9g5b
"I think this might be the turning point especially if they play like they don‚Äôt care and can‚Äôt even do the basics‚Ä¶if with all that, they lose‚Ä¶I think Anfield will definitely start to visibly turn on the players",Liverpool,Yes,j7be41o,t1_j7ayh2j
"I mean they have insane revenue and sold a shit load of their possible future earnings. Their old president truely fucked them, but on the pitch they are on the right route. Financially I can't really judge them, I know they are pretty fucked but I really didn't care that much to actually follow their financials lmao.

Xavi seems very good overall, the players he wanted are mostly very good. They were also giga lucky with getting Pedri, dude is absolutely worldclass, and Gavi and Balde coming through as well. Their name is also big enough to get players like Lewandowski lol. But comparing us currently with them, its like day and night. They are so fast, so swift lol. We need new owners and new players :C :D",Liverpool,Yes,j7d1153,t1_j7d07iw
14-2,Liverpool,Yes,j7d5a2i,t1_j7d4ojl
Joemez,Liverpool,Yes,j7axfqt,t1_j7avrwb
All logic goes out the window when Liverpool play in Europe,Liverpool,Yes,j7csj60,t1_j7csfpl
"Luis Diaz missed 26 days through injury in 3 years at Porto playing 125 games. 

He signed for us and played 38 games and has missed 141 days through injury. 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd find the same results if I looked into Jota as well. It‚Äôs beyond brainwashed if you think our playing style/ training methods aren‚Äôt the cause of the constant injuries in this team. Several members of the clubs medical department have quit as a direct result.",Liverpool,Yes,j7av209,t1_j7asxp8
It can ALWAYS get worse,Liverpool,Yes,j7arv74,t1_j7ar686
Jude Bellingham signs a 2 year deal at the age of 37*,Liverpool,Yes,j7am9oo,t1_j7ak90q
"Man, Jota I dont know what to say. Such a good player, but hes injured like 50% of the time .",Liverpool,Yes,j7b9byx,t1_j7b8h0x
"Oh, forgot! Yes, welcome to the club Thiago.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b5ne3,t1_j7b5je4
Hope so mate,Liverpool,Yes,j7aejou,t1_j7aegaw
every week their asset decreases in value. They need to stop playing hardball,Liverpool,Yes,j7aeua5,t1_j7aegaw
One would hope so,Liverpool,Yes,j7b503u,t1_j7b3tis
Hopefully it'll wake them up..,Liverpool,Yes,j7a68zo,t1_j7a5m3m
"Lmao true, same for Sadio

It's like, when players go away, their past performances with us get better for like 150%, it's incredible

I dread the day when Bobby is gonna go. ""AA IF BOBBY WAS HERE, HE'D COLLECT THE BALL FROM ALI, DRIBBLE PAST EVERYONE AND SCOREüòéüòé"" ffs",Liverpool,Yes,j7aq4fv,t1_j7aph9b
Mo?? Id drive him to Paris myself. nothing you say is wrong but hes been shocking since Afcon and this sentimental attitude has partially brought us into this mess,Liverpool,Yes,j7ankt9,t1_j7ampr6
"I'd be sad based on his input pre-Afcon for sure. But he, along with everyone else on Saturday are completely fair game imo. He's nowhere near the levels we need him to be, nor that of a player on 350k a week.

People can say he doesn't get the service but it's just nonsense, he can't even do the basics right at the moment. He's utterly devoid of confidence and more worryingly, desire. I fear with that contract, does he even have the incentive to try and get it back?

Might be better doing a Coutinho and cashing in for new blood. They won't be as effective as prime Mo obviously but if they can trap a ball and find a red shirt then their input will be greater than his right now.",Liverpool,Yes,j7an7xl,t1_j7ampr6
Just seen there record and they have never scored there in 5 games LOL,Liverpool,Yes,j7c7uo0,t1_j7c6wgf
He doesn't deserve to be a part of the battering we're about to suffer in the hands of Dyche,Liverpool,Yes,j7a9bx3,t1_j7a8xzo
"They didn‚Äôt save us
They were guaranteed to make back their investment and then some . They bought us dirt cheap 
They are running us into the ground with neglect joe",Liverpool,Yes,j7bnkuo,t1_j7bmvnz
"He‚Äôs carried us a lot in the past and previous seasons and he‚Äôs also scored in like every ucl game this season, so I‚Äôm just talking about right now to be honest. Others should take charge in that case but even so, there‚Äôs no one. It sucks. But it would also help massively if his form was good..",Liverpool,Yes,j7bqom0,t1_j7bqie0
"Klopp smiles a lot too when we lose, we got a team of smilers üò≠",Liverpool,Yes,j7bqrgi,t1_j7bqie0
"My guy, VVD is approaching 32 and needs a replacement and honestly he‚Äôs never been the same since his injury, Gomez is well.. Gomez, Trent‚Äôs everything but a right-back, Matip no way good enough so far. So that leaves Robbo, Ibou, Greek god, and VVD.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b0ucg,t1_j7b027o
"All comes down to Kornmayer, apparently made both decisions, his influence is ridiculous",Liverpool,Yes,j7ce9hn,t1_j7cconk
The real answer,Liverpool,Yes,j7cdzsy,t1_j7cconk
Wait they don‚Äôt make those videos or they are just banned here?,Liverpool,Yes,j7cfc7n,t1_j7cconk
Didn‚Äôt that happen towards end of last season?,Liverpool,Yes,j7ciul3,t1_j7cconk
What? Jesus Christ lad everything‚Äôs not race based,Liverpool,Yes,j7asgm3,t1_j7as4ur
"cheers mate didn't think of that.

I already have. And I would assume others have too. I'm just predicting they'll ignore it.",Liverpool,Yes,j7asscj,t1_j7aso2o
"and yet he's so much better than Gakpo

Take Darwin out and the attack gets even worse, take Gakpo out and there's no difference",Liverpool,Yes,j7bminl,t1_j7blobv
Wait til you hear about Gakpo..,Liverpool,Yes,j7bn7j1,t1_j7blan6
"I'm sorry it would be the final nail, the last time Red Bird put stake into the club they went and bought an NHL team",Liverpool,Yes,j7ajo9s,t1_j7ajhgt
Their previous investment was supposed to generate 500 million that was supposed to go into the club. How much of that have we received again? Other than in the form of loans that FSG takes back from us at the expense of strengthening the squad?,Liverpool,Yes,j7aosp3,t1_j7ajhgt
"If that guy has a release clause, so many clubs will be after him.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aldeh,t1_j7agpu6
"Salah used to do the same, just shrug big defenders off.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b76h5,t1_j7b50r7

Basically saying the brains are all leaving because they dont feel empowered in their roles and that there is turmoil internally both at the top and with the fitness/physio departments",Liverpool,Yes,j7aqyxz,t1_j7aqf0c
Son on the ball in a counter-attack is one of the deadliest scenarios for football defences,Liverpool,Yes,j7c0vdq,t1_j7bs77y
"100%

They'll just continue to use our revenue to pay off the infrastructure debts and use any Redbird investment to increase their portfolio. It's a win-win for them.",Liverpool,Yes,j7at9z2,t1_j7asyof
"Completely correct.

With FSG by themselves or a 'strategic partner', we will still have to raise finances in the summer to fund a rebuild.

Not to mention, it sounds like FSG do not give a fuck about what's going on behind the scenes as long as it remains their cash cow.",Liverpool,Yes,j7afb0t,t1_j7af2it
"We've been asking this all year, what can we do to change this form. First when we had the mini break after the Queen passed, then when the world cup was on and now multiple times since then. It's just endless and I think it will be until the end of the season where a clear out has to happen. Buy early, bed them in quick and get going for next season",Liverpool,Yes,j7ab8yn,t1_j7a9vab
Oh. I didn't know that.,Liverpool,Yes,j7agmq7,t1_j7agl13
Tbf I defended it at the time but I'm suprised its getting upvoted given how much people hated it a week ago,Liverpool,Yes,j7b4fp4,t1_j7b3y5i
"Thats a pretty clear difference to his heat map this year, look at the difference on the touchline.

"Most of them are ""tOp ReD"" and possessed with mediocrity. I am sick of them. Besides our legends don't give a shit as it seems, Gerrard wants a job at fsg so he won't say anything against them, cara ain't nevil and he says nothing about nothing, bottom line is we are screwed.",Liverpool,Yes,j7au8kd,t1_j7ar050
"Protest how FSG have allowed us to become a joke again. FSG are sharing the same ambition as mid table clubs, if it wasn't for the Coutinho sale we wouldn't have half the team we have today let alone the trophies to go with it. 

By not sending a message to the owners we're basically allowing them to continue making a mockery of the club. They tried to trademark Liverpool, they tried to Furlough the staff, they supported the Super League and now they're trying to cash in whilst we struggle so they don't need to invest another penny.",Liverpool,Yes,j7attqx,t1_j7ate6c
You do realise that these concepts can co-exist?,Liverpool,Yes,j7auhn1,t1_j7ate6c
"Thiago can handle himself when it comes to dirty work, that‚Äôs why he has most won duels and tackles for our midfield. It‚Äôs his midfield partner that‚Äôs the issue. None of them have been reliable this season",Liverpool,Yes,j7cj0lx,t1_j7cbn8i
"I always felt he had the physical attributes but the technical aspects of his defending have always been average. Now after a few injuries, loss of pace etc. The lack of his speed and diminishing strength isn't making up for his technical deficiencies and he's getting pretty found out by a lot of opposing attackers.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ahiko,t1_j7agg23
"Nah, mate, enough with all the mentality issues. He simply isn't good enough",Liverpool,Yes,j7agia0,t1_j7agg23
Glade you screenshot it for the people trying to lie their way of it,Liverpool,Yes,j7be9z0,t1_j7aydc7
This is more than a year old bro. We did relatively quite well before this season. The sentiment on them has changed and majority of this sub is anti FSG now. The comments I‚Äôm referring to are pretty suspect because of the Qatari bootlickers right now among us.,Liverpool,Yes,j7aypza,t1_j7aydc7
Haaland has been great but Ake has been so important for them outside of the goals Haaland offers them nothing,Liverpool,Yes,j7c1c9c,t1_j7c10s6
Grealish right ?,Liverpool,Yes,j7c1j6u,t1_j7c10s6
Would hopefully light a fire under Salah being dropped for a couple games as well since he's never been in that position for us before.,Liverpool,Yes,j7db23a,t1_j7d0wl7
Then they shouldn‚Äôt complain when people call them hypocrites and that they do t speak for every fan,Liverpool,Yes,j7bhxj2,t1_j7bhlho
"Pretty sure fsg donated millions to trump 
No one mentioned wanting  quatar üòÇ

"Do you even have a source? Trump was way more in favour of KSA.

Also, Trump initiating the withdrawal from Afghanistan was one of the few things he did right.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bp4ck,t1_j7bnjtg
"God I hope not. Besides Redbird being all around bad news, what a waste of resources and time to seek bids when the owners aren't actually inclined to take them seriously.

I was to understand FSG have been settling up some short term debt on the club, which could provide some hope a full takeover bid could still be what they're after in the end.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ba5e9,t1_j7b7vro
People seem to think we're instantly an unattractive place to come becasue of 1 bad season in 5 years lmfao,Liverpool,Yes,j7azvd4,t1_j7az0hg
"When was the last time we spent 100m for a midfielder, 88m for a winger, in the same season?  We are mid-table and don‚Äôt spent big. Plus Bellingham will be getting offers from Madrid and City.",Liverpool,Yes,j7azauc,t1_j7az0hg
"Maybe get another midfielder? Let‚Äôs not pretend like he‚Äôs the only good midfielder in the world. We came back from challenging for the quadruple, and should have leveraged that",Liverpool,Yes,j7axj1m,t1_j7axcsj
"Yeah, and we also don‚Äôt have the money to spend. So that‚Äôs no money and no European football. What is the draw? He‚Äôs a highly sought after player",Liverpool,Yes,j7ayu2g,t1_j7ay3vi
In terms of money...we have no money,Liverpool,Yes,j7ayiw0,t1_j7ay3vi
"Generally speaking, you want a solid defensive unit that stays in position and doesn't get pulled out of position.  Gomez is playing like Lovren.  They were incapable of keeping a solid defensive unit without A LOT of help.

With that said, that doesn't excuse other players from doing their jobs properly.  Andy was in perfect position and vacated it early, which directly resulted in Acuna (?) being wide open.  It's worse than Gomez because all Andy had to do was stand still for another 2 seconds.",Liverpool,Yes,j7afhdw,t1_j7ae9s6
"TBF though they didn't have a cheap team themselves. Osimhen himself would have been our record transfer. But I get your point, I'd like to see us take some risks like Napoli did by signing Kim Min Jae from Turkey but that'd be a huge deviation from what we've always done.",Liverpool,Yes,j7azi0h,t1_j7axyo4
What if you guys slipped even further down the table?,Liverpool,Yes,j7al4d7,t1_j7aj76n
True,Liverpool,Yes,j7denww,t1_j7daofq
Any teams? Honestly there might be midfields in that league thats prob better than our starting three,Liverpool,Yes,j7ab8el,t1_j7a9zuu
"And what would be the point of that? 

FSG gets enough flak anyway. I guess he is criticizing internally and lets the club know what he needs. 

There is already too much noise around the club and it surely isnt helping currently. Imagine your employer being in disarray. Would you not be insecure about the future? Why should he open up another front?",Liverpool,Yes,j7b0xk7,t1_j7b0dcc
">That‚Äôs what annoys me. Klopps in a position only a couple managers have ever been in where as bad as it gets the fans would never want him out.

>Which makes him more powerful than the owners.

This correlation isn't based on reality but pure fantasy. As if history hasn't shown to us by numerous examples, that Billionaires don't like to be called out.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b1lg0,t1_j7b0dcc
We can't have watched the same player. I lost count of how many times he cut inside to his right and hit a terrible cross either too far or into the keeper's arms. He has been awful since he came in.,Liverpool,Yes,j7acc6i,t1_j7a8z4h
he absolutely wasn't. VVD has been seriously disrespected on here over the course of this season. He's had a few poor moments but by and large he's still been good.,Liverpool,Yes,j7ar8tc,t1_j7aqg8i
Honestly it‚Äôs annoying all there‚Äôs online fans cry ‚Äòoh my god citeh fans are obsessed with us‚Äô then spout shite like this.,Liverpool,Yes,j7bwwtj,t1_j7bs7pp
"The game is fun? The last 7 months has been disastrous as a Liverpool fan. I love the club to death, but I‚Äôm saying football in general has been hard to watch as a Liverpool fan, sure many fans share the same opinion. Not sure how it has anything to do with ‚Äògrowing up‚Äô.",Liverpool,Yes,j7byr9r,t1_j7bxpkj
Dortmund mentioned they had  the same issue with haaland,Liverpool,Yes,j7ckms6,t1_j7c5g6n
But similarly you would argue they are worse in the league this season. Against United and Today he offered very little whereas Jesus or a false 9 could help the link up play and allow them to dominate more,Liverpool,Yes,j7c6j2j,t1_j7c5g6n
It's the truth and you know it,Liverpool,Yes,j7dad94,t1_j7da95p
"He‚Äôs disappearing in big games tho, sure City‚Äôs defence is slop this season but Haaland should be able to make things happen and change games, if Nunez could take his chances he‚Äôd be miles ahead of him",Liverpool,Yes,j7c8pak,t1_j7c7lfv
"Short term could be great (not sure if Klopp stays long after though) and long term, looking at PSG, I can‚Äôt get excited. We think we will be some type of an exception to other soulless, sportwashing clubs because we are Liverpool. It might take a bit longer but we will eventually get there.

Both our current (or most plausible at this point) options are not the best in the short and/or long term. It‚Äôs either rot away with FSG or become a sportwashing project for Qatar‚Äôs government right now. Watch a couple of random businessmen who have no issues investing but United though.",Liverpool,Yes,j7beyms,t1_j7ax8r8
Well to be fair the source also mentioned that we are in contact with QIA.,Liverpool,Yes,j7ay3h3,t1_j7awunp
Kostas has not performed time and time again lol what,Liverpool,Yes,j7bk7v7,t1_j7bh3yz
The only man I‚Äôd say is giving it his all at the moment is Robbo,Liverpool,Yes,j7bi3i6,t1_j7bh3yz
"Even with the Arthur deal I was optimistic because there‚Äôs a very talented player in there. The second he got a long term injury, we should have been pinging the phones of every midfielder on the market about a move, because if the stopgap you‚Äôve signed gets injured, you‚Äôre back at square one but apparently no one at the club understands that.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aiqh1,t1_j7aiie6
"Didn‚Äôt he play in the hole when Chelsea had a 3 man midfield?

Either way, Jorginho specifically isn‚Äôt the point. I‚Äôm just saying that we should really have been looking at the deals other clubs are doing and try to jump in. Sabitzer is another example of a midfielder we just let fly past us",Liverpool,Yes,j7aimqy,t1_j7aikye
"Exactly. I‚Äôd be cautiously optimistic if it was any other team in the CL due to our pedigree, but we‚Äôre playing against the final boss.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bblix,t1_j7bbbia
"Despite how bad they are recently they still have a great midfield. If they still had Casemiro on top of everyone else, he would destroy all of our midfielders while Fabinho would get outrun by even Mariano.",Liverpool,Yes,j7cwx3w,t1_j7cwnfp
"We won't buy him lol, i was thinking barca or Madrid.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b2a3j,t1_j7b25tn
So you guys have 2 left wingers now with Diaz and gakpo?,Liverpool,Yes,j7b2ccg,t1_j7b1zh3
???,Liverpool,Yes,j7bes1n,t1_j7bencl
True. I agree he‚Äôll be done in a year or so. I honestly wish we get Davies at some point. I also honestly don‚Äôt hate Tsimikas.,Liverpool,Yes,j7beyv3,t1_j7bes0e
"If we sign Gerrard. Then gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost‚Äù",Liverpool,Yes,j7ahxz9,t1_j7ahtyl
"No, when you have teams like Chelsea, city, newcastle and united around us.",Liverpool,Yes,j7acxfs,t1_j7acusb
Lol was thinking the same,Liverpool,Yes,j7bre1n,t1_j7bph0u
Sure?  He‚Äôs actually pretty decent at a long pass and one of the few mids who actually has a reasonable number of assists in recent seasons.  Our top assisters are almost always the forwards and fullbacks followed usually by Henderson.,Liverpool,Yes,j7c6q5l,t1_j7c0rur
You'll have a 433 and you'll like it!,Liverpool,Yes,j7c1p0r,t1_j7c0xzp
And he injured Diaz. One of the biggest blows to our season.,Liverpool,Yes,j7b7npo,t1_j7b6le8
Aren‚Äôt clowns funny?,Liverpool,Yes,j7bfjlf,t1_j7b956j
"Some people will never learn, man. There's still people going around who believe Man√© was only on 100k til the day he left us. 

They have a story set in their minds and no fact is getting in the way of that.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ag6bh,t1_j7afbv1
There were rumours he felt unappreciated by the club who were making a fuss about Salah renewing. Could have been a bit of both: that and wanting a new challenge.,Liverpool,Yes,j7aggpy,t1_j7afbv1
"Key point is, we didn‚Äôt replace Mane with someone on his level. We got a striker who can‚Äôt score.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aff01,t1_j7afbv1
"Jesus has been injured all season, Nunez has not. Nunez is a striker, we have Mitrovic who has 10 goals in the league. We have Danny Ings who scored 7 goals in all completion, and he plays less games. Maybe we should sign him?",Liverpool,Yes,j7agbzd,t1_j7afzjy
"Yeah I know they can‚Äôt if it‚Äôs a yellow, just seems like a second yellow changes the game so much you‚Äôd want to make sure it‚Äôs the correct decision so allow VAR to check",Liverpool,Yes,j7c43ds,t1_j7c3qqy
His mobility has definitely improved since being in the prem. But yeah he‚Äôs not fast. Besides his technical ability he seems like a real leader to me and we sorely miss that right now as well. Given the athleticism of our front 3 if we have two more athletic players around him I think it‚Äôs fine. Fabinho when great for us was not fast or mobile.,Liverpool,Yes,j7aebbz,t1_j7ae14l
People mistake running around endlessly with playing good,Liverpool,Yes,j7as30u,t1_j7ar706
The narrative around Robbo shifts every time he puts in a decent or bad performance lmao,Liverpool,Yes,j7arvqc,t1_j7ar706
So has Thiago. More goals conceded from possessions lost than goals scored from chance creations.,Liverpool,Yes,j7av6x2,t1_j7ar706
"Can‚Äôt think of any tbh, it‚Äôs just an obvious corollary of the relationship between coach and players going toxic - one or the other must go. 

It‚Äôs far cheaper and - always will be - to bin the manager, whatever level of football you‚Äôre at. Maybe some extremely unusual outliers like Salford where they‚Äôre backed by a whole bunch of millionaires and play in a relatively low league could afford to bin out the squad instead of the manager I suppose, or Chelsea right now where they‚Äôre determined to spend as much as possible.",Liverpool,Yes,j7amhrd,t1_j7ahiov
"Arsenal maybe? 

They backed Arteta in getting rid of Guendouzi, Ozil, Aubameyang over attitude and mentality issues. I think they'd even just given Aubameyang a big new contract just months before Arteta wanted him gone. 

Also got rid of Mustafi who despite being a big investment was rubbish for them. And backed him in pushing Leno and Martinez out to bring in Ramsdale.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bjlgc,t1_j7ahiov
"your right. I think Mane leaving was the biggest factor tho, somehow sadio motivated salah to keep outdo him. kinda like how Suarez and Sturridge competed to outdo each other back in the SAS days. Since Mane gone mo doesn't seem so motivated anymore like he won the war and now enjoy the plunder. Neither Nunez or gakpo for that matter seem to motivate/inspire him to step his game up.",Liverpool,Yes,j7amaxx,t1_j7akjq2
they supposedly dont take money out though. And their profit (which only materialises when they sell percentages) will only grow as long as our valuation grows. Which it wont without significant investment and nobody is investing 400m without a controlling stake,Liverpool,Yes,j7adhvd,t1_j7acuyf
"Because they get money while still hanging on to one of their most valuable assets? If they don't get what they think is a large enough bid for the whole club, they're not going to sell up.",Liverpool,Yes,j7auix4,t1_j7angq6
"
He also had that interview where he accepted he was wrong tbf. That interview got him melo. 

Fsg seems done with the club ever since super league plans went out of the window. At this point they are just trying to spend as little as possible to run the club, therefore no dof, no club doctor and multiple people leaving.

It takes money to pay these people wages. But the media won't mention so they are nitpicking at everything they can. 

From Kornmeyer to Ljinders.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ckm21,t1_j7cjzor
"David Lynch and Mo chatra already referenced it, so it must be true. They are both well reputed to say something like that casually in the passing and that's good enough for me.",Liverpool,Yes,j7dk3ul,t1_j7dfxxg
"I think people project their own willingness to give up on other people.

Jurgen just a couple weeks ago said he had the energy for 10 more years. He isnt likely to give up like most of the fanbase. Its a hard job...tis why you appreciate the good times and dont act like a twat just because you finish second or lose a final",Liverpool,Yes,j7b44dy,t1_j7ayc6n
"It wont be untenable if nobody is asking for it. 

His job is to get the team back to stability. Right now, he is failing at that but it wont be forever.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b4bpt,t1_j7ayecg

Thought it was Chelsea away during queens death,Liverpool,Yes,j7blvqr,t1_j7blrsx
"It‚Äôs truly just a lack of effort imo. Call it fatigue, disinterest, coming down to earth after last season, I genuinely have no fucking idea. It‚Äôs probably a giant goddamn pie chart full of 2% bullshit reasons all over the board. However, one thing I always loved about our team is the effort. That is not there, and that is why we are even more frustrated.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ab4xp,t1_j7aazob
Hahah shes a keeper.,Liverpool,Yes,j7ab1d1,t1_j7aazdn
"It‚Äôs why we love them, but mate, fifa makes no one happy",Liverpool,Yes,j7ab106,t1_j7aazdn
Bringing on veterans to lock it down doesn‚Äôt work when the veterans cause most of the problems.,Liverpool,Yes,j7d0nqq,t1_j7c4twa
"it‚Äôs true but given the chances darwin has missed it‚Äôs just frustrating to watch . He‚Äôs not a player who can play like bobby and not a clinical finisher. 
he‚Äôs good in a team who sits back and counter attack",Liverpool,Yes,j7abgm7,t1_j7aaum5
That's a whole other story but in general I just don't rate him. When we signed VVD or Alisson as our big signings I totally got it but Darwin? I don't get it. He just isn't worth anywhere near what we paid him and there were so many better ways to spend that money.,Liverpool,Yes,j7acf2u,t1_j7aaum5
How many of those has he scored after taking a touch? Just gets the ball and shoots it straight like a moron,Liverpool,Yes,j7aasd3,t1_j7aaf3n
"I forgot about their academy. If they can produce high-caliber players like Gavi and more importantly retain them, then they'll definitely use it to their advantage and rebuild into their peak team.",Liverpool,Yes,j7d1cew,t1_j7d1153
And we will have only injury prone Matip right after his injury and Phillips at CB. And no subs,Liverpool,Yes,j7axne1,t1_j7axfqt
I hope so brother,Liverpool,Yes,j7csxb8,t1_j7csj60
"Hodgson was sacked with 25 points in 21 games. If we lose to Ev, its 29 from 21.

Roy is the bar",Liverpool,Yes,j7awjbq,t1_j7arv74
"yeah part of why i think that way is because all of these  stake news comes from Echo, which have been sort of FSG's boston globe; they report what FSG wants them to say. Regardless hope something gets sorted soon. The waiting game itself is exhausting",Liverpool,Yes,j7aesyn,t1_j7aejou
They had a week off after the Brighton loss and we thought it would wake them up‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..,Liverpool,Yes,j7a7e5d,t1_j7a68zo
"Glad you‚Äôve put that out there. Some fans have short term memory loss it seems. He‚Äôs due some criticism for his torrid performances, but we can‚Äôt negate what he‚Äôs done for us, applies to Klopp and many of the world class performers we‚Äôve had over the years.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bsetm,t1_j7bqom0
"Trent is a right back and has been since he first came into the first team a big reason for his form is due to the system completely falling flat and having no midfield in front of him to help defend, he's not even getting over the halfway line anymore to affect the game in the final third.

Matips been poor this season but saying he isn't good enough anymore isn't right, once VVD is back and next to him he'll be better.

Gomez we kind of need to keep because he's homegrown, I'd rather sell him as well but what homegrown CB would we get in place for him?",Liverpool,Yes,j7b1qqz,t1_j7b0ucg
"Ahhh Kornmeyer the modern Achterberg. 
The evil scrupulous twat that sits in John Henry‚Äôs and Klopps ear and destroys every possible thing in our club. Manc probably trained a fitness coach for 10years in Muinch to infiltrate us and fuck our golden gen up.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ciy7m,t1_j7ce9hn
He‚Äôs making Klopp ignore the social media advice and it‚Äôs causing real friction behind the scenes and he‚Äôs insisting we make a MySpace,Liverpool,Yes,j7cj06t,t1_j7ce9hn
We were all watching these videos seeing our players happy and training in great form. Then along comes Fsg saying that posting these videos harms profits and banned this,Liverpool,Yes,j7ceymm,t1_j7cdzsy
Banned it here since the videos are only available on   Lfc Go which is a paid membership subscription,Liverpool,Yes,j7cg4o1,t1_j7cfc7n
"Most of the time it is with media though, gets clicks and outrages the weirdos",Liverpool,Yes,j7atb5i,t1_j7asgm3
Well I doubt you're going to get a lightning fast response on a Sunday afternoon. We'll see. To be fair if you read their previous statement in full I think this incident can be covered by that one too.,Liverpool,Yes,j7atksk,t1_j7asscj
Gapko has been fairly ineffective so far yep,Liverpool,Yes,j7bnfw6,t1_j7bminl
Reddy is a known shill for corporate owners. She‚Äôs been doing fluff pieces for the Glazers too. It‚Äôs a bit concerning FSG are trying to blame Klopp through the media.,Liverpool,Yes,j7at6zr,t1_j7aqyxz
"Almost like reddit posters don't know what they are talking about when it comes to tactics. My favourite complaint here is why does Klopp only play 433 he is so one dimensional and rigid. 

As if formations are a rigid thing on the field and people are told to stand in one area of field only, like people haven't heard things about interchanging freely  moving positional play.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b4sv6,t1_j7b4fp4
"Can't u see it here as well? They are so similar. And this is from the 2019 season.

Also we are trying different formations and tinkering with salah positioning more this season, sometimes in 442 or 424. Also this is half a season of heatmap, Nunez, jota and Diaz coming back will change Salah position more won't it?",Liverpool,Yes,j7cgx8h,t1_j7cgkon
"Then there's last years where the change was made and thats a full year.

"Neither did anything about Hicks and Gillet as well, just sat on the sideline and kept their mouth shut instead of supporting the local protestors. Pep Reina of all the people from the club called out the ownership.",Liverpool,Yes,j7awms4,t1_j7au8kd
"A protest has to have an aim or it's just a whinge. If your only tangible aim is ""Showing FSG they've ran us badly"" and then saying it's because of all of the other stuff they did but conveniently only takes place now we're shit then not only is it not going to achieve anything but it looks stupid too",Liverpool,Yes,j7ay01n,t1_j7attqx
"How does it matter if it‚Äôs a year old? Those accounts still exist. There was a lot of arguing here in the summer when we didn‚Äôt get a 4th CB. We then went and wasted an entire season, during which the FSG defenders had gone quiet. And yet that post was still made and hundreds of users still upvoted bootlicking comments despite of that horrible season. This past summer, people were supporting FSG whenever the midfield situation was brought up. We started the season poorly and the FSGin people either went quiet or went to r/soccer to complain about how whiny this place has become. Some of us have been here for years, we know how the clockwork goes. We‚Äôll salvage something from this season eventually/hopefully, and the FSG asskissing will resume.",Liverpool,Yes,j7azl4j,t1_j7aypza
">outside of the goals Haaland offers them nothing

Thats true but at the end of the day scoring is what he's there for and he's scored a mad amount as well.",Liverpool,Yes,j7c1phx,t1_j7c1c9c
Dude he has banged in 25 goals for them. On track to demolish Salah's record. Pretty sure that's more than enough for him to offer nothing outside of just goal scoring.,Liverpool,Yes,j7cbezg,t1_j7c1c9c
Agreed,Liverpool,Yes,j7bi9vw,t1_j7bhxj2
"I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm being an extreme pessimist if I was to believe what I originally said. It makes no sense for either party, but regardless, RedBird have financial pressure placed upon the reliance and promise they‚Äôve secured Milan fans of rebuilding a new stadium. Why on earth would that mean that they‚Äôd spend a billion on investing in FSG? Makes no sense. Also, your point about the debt is spot on. It‚Äôs all a hoax in my opinion, plus whatever they do has no bearings upon the sale.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bs4z0,t1_j7ba5e9
"The amount of debt we have is near insignificant to the size of what they seem to want to sell for though.  Seems to be a popular line, but any new owners aren‚Äôt going to be too fussed about our current debt levels.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bjqm5,t1_j7ba5e9
Funny goal post move tbh,Liverpool,Yes,j7b2eob,t1_j7azauc
We've known Bellingham would go for well over 100m for a year at the very least. Hasn't killed any Bellingham to Liverpool talk though.,Liverpool,Yes,j7azm0b,t1_j7azauc
"Oh I‚Äôm not, I agree with what you are saying, we should have got a midfielder. We were linked with Nunes and ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt afford‚Äù to pay his release clause, we should have done that and got him in the summer. We should have added another midfielder in the winter window as well.",Liverpool,Yes,j7axyp8,t1_j7axj1m
"We clearly do have it to spend...its what its spent on. For example...they chose to spend 40 on Gakpo and not another position.

Included add ons...80+ on Nunez and not other positions. Whats the draw...seriously?",Liverpool,Yes,j7b3tzr,t1_j7ayu2g
We clearly do.,Liverpool,Yes,j7b3zuh,t1_j7ayiw0
"doesn‚Äòt change it. j√ºrgen has done more than enough to earn his go at a rebuild. sacking him would be the worst thing possible.  
i‚Äòd rather sell each and every player.  
first fsg need to go, though.",Liverpool,Yes,j7alw39,t1_j7al4d7
"Ignore him he‚Äôs a plastic. Reality is Klopp had enough good wills in the bank right now, however he will need to start changing things.

We can cry until the cows come home about lack of investment yet the investment we have had has been misspent of late, we‚Äôre needed a midfielder for how long? We sign Gakpo in January. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be a fine player but he wasn‚Äôt needed, especially to play out of position.
I think Klopp gets until this time next year, if things don‚Äôt improve I think he walks to be honest. He looks like it‚Äôs all getting to him. 

Klopp has strengths that out weight his weaknesses but he used to have a team that mitigated he weaknesses, right now the clubs having endless shake ups behind the scenes, Klopp and pep seem to be getting more and more power, taking on more and more responsibilities and it does not work at all. 

We need to go back to what we were doing, everything was analytical and there were teams of people looking at players etc now it‚Äôs pep whispering to Klopp ‚ÄòGakpo init lad fuck midfield‚Äô it seems.",Liverpool,Yes,j7avfph,t1_j7al4d7
Middlesbrough and Burnley I‚Äôd recommend,Liverpool,Yes,j7adh8p,t1_j7ab8el

But LOL giraffe memes lol,Liverpool,Yes,j7asyje,t1_j7ar8tc
"No one can actually explain how Matip was apparently better than VVD over the whole of last season (which ended in Matip getting demoted behind Konate). The Matip > VVD narrative was actually started by rival fans last season to try and discredit VVD‚Äôs legacy and it ridiculously got parroted by some Liverpool fans I guess wanting a hipster opinion.

"Yes but Red bird is more likely to happen though, as it already has happened before and their money is shady as far as I know. So it's kinda hypocritical of the OP to be concerned about one thing while the other thing is more likely to happen for real.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ayd8c,t1_j7ay3h3
"‚Ä¶ And he‚Äôs not looking great either. Attitude-wise he does seem up for it, performance-wise meh sadly.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bkovz,t1_j7bi3i6

he isn‚Äòt strong or fast enough to be a real cdm.

Ffs mate Diaz is Mane's replacement. Just because Diaz arrived when Mane was still here doesn't mean Darwin is meant to be the new Mane. Diaz was meant to be bought last summer but the deal was brought forward because of Spurs' interest,Liverpool,Yes,j7ag08s,t1_j7aff01

I think he is just less clinical in front of goal and the team is creating less high quality chances for him, positional wise all heat maps are similar at least to me.

">Salah is practically always as wide as the toucline now there's no drifting out wide needed most of the time because he's stuck out there.

Are we just talking about yesterday's match or overall because there is a distinction, yesterday salah wasn't that outwide he had some decent chances to score, like three to four at least, with one or two he came close to scoring. 

Also this is the first time in weeks salah is playing with nunez and Gakpo and would get some of his own space as the defense had other players to concentrate on, instead of trying to go outwide to find more space he was able to play in the half space and would either be in a space which a striker would occupy or would go outwide. 

Hugging the line is a myth people keep repeating maybe it was early in the season, but not so anymore. 

>Wow he got in the box once to hit a shot most of the time he was behind the halfway line barely getting the chance to influence the game in the final third. 

This is such a weird thing to nitpick on trent not overlapping anymore,  cause this was the precise reason why the team kept getting caught on the counter attack as we don't have anyone covering the space left behind by an overlapping trent. 

So trent has been told to use his passing range to dictate play from deep which he is doing fine as a tactic, Nunez nearly scored from a deep ball from trent, as he has done earlier. 

Due to this very change in tactics trent has been getting praise post world cup and is yet to be beaten by any player outwide other than mitoma. 

Even Man city doesn't play with two overlapping wide men. At best cancelo used to go overlapping while walker used to stay behind, forming three at the back. 

This is just biased pov from you, forming an agenda cause if Trent was caught upfield you would be criticising this very tactic. 

>even Robbo hardly gets forward as much as he used to now.

Robbo is overlapping fine, its only his final ball devilery which has been poor. Even Tsmikas is making deep runs, many times Robbo and Tsmikas have found themselves in the box and have taken a shot or two at goal. 

Trent goes in the box whenever he gets a chance and doesn't have to go back and forth anymore and get caught lacking. 

>
What when we were 2-0 down? of course they're going to push up higher when we are chasing a lead it would be worrying if they didn't.

It wasn't a tactical decision to go down  2-0 by the 12th mins surely. Maybe we wouldn't have pushed up quite a bit like we did yesterday but surely we would have attacked.

">Are we just talking about yesterday's match or overall because there is a distinction, yesterday salah wasn't that outwide he had some decent chances to score, like three to four at least, with one or two he came close to scoring.

Overall, its been a change that was made from the start of last season and it only really worked because Salah was in incredible form and able to beat 2/3 men and score or find a killer pass so why perssist with it when he's not capable of doing that now?

>Hugging the line is a myth people keep repeating maybe it was early in the season, but not so anymore.

[https://www.sofascore.com/player/mohamed-salah/159665](https://www.sofascore.com/player/mohamed-salah/159665)

His heat map is pretty telling, hugging the touchline for the majority of it and you can look at last seasons its the exact same but looking at seasons before then its clearly a majority of it is in the box.

>This is such a weird thing to nitpick on trent not overlapping anymore, cause this was the precise reason why the team kept getting caught on the counter attack as we don't have anyone covering the space left behind by an overlapping trent.

>So trent has been told to use his passing range to dictate play from deep which he is doing fine as a tactic, Nunez nearly scored from a deep ball from trent, as he has done earlier.

We're still getting countered down his side anyway what difference does it make? having him positioned where he is just takes away the threat he gives when it comes to the final third, a couple deep long balls to Nunez in comparison to the amount of chances he used to consistently create when further up the pitch.

>Even Man city doesn't play with two overlapping wide men. At best cancelo used to go overlapping while walker used to stay behind, forming three at the back.

">We're still getting countered down his side anyway what difference does it make?

Every fullback gets countered, cause it's football. Are we conceding less goals on his side? 

Yes. The first two goals were literally on the other side, not Trent's. The third goal was further up the field. 

Even the mitoma goal was on the other side. 

Plus Trent is being used to mop up loose balls, and is playing a deep playmaker role. He is creating enough and it's not like he is restricted to only staying back. He gets plenty of opportunities to go up the field whenever he can and if the side is dominating with the ball, like yesterday in the second half. 

 But without the presence of Peak hendo and a young kid as the primary DM, it doesn't make sense to make the side get exposed on his side.",Liverpool,Yes,j7cazzv,t1_j7c6uea

"Feels like I say it once a week but it needs to be said. Deciding to let go of Wijnaldum without replacing him was indirectly deciding to add an extra 60+ games to Fabinho, Henderson, Keita and Thiago who were already struggling to play 25 games per season each anyway. Not to mention getting rid of the only balanced/mobile box to box we had. We have zero presence in midfield and absolutely no options of quality players to bring into those positions. An equal replacement previously would‚Äôve saved everyone‚Äôs legs but now we desperately need 2 high quality/hardworking number 8s to transform this team.

Manager of the month curse strikes again and promptly,Liverpool,Yes,j76pkwy,t1_j76ph4i
They have understandably given up on the season. A lot of them probably realized we wouldn‚Äôt be challenging when we didn‚Äôt invest in the summer. Imagine being Salah and realizing you‚Äôre facing a full season with players who should‚Äôve retired. January transfer window was the last nail in the coffin. They know there is no way we‚Äôre getting top 4 with this squad. We have nothing to play for.,Liverpool,Yes,j772ivs,t1_j770jb3
Every team does,Liverpool,Yes,j76hm03,t1_j76gyvi
Same honestly. Don't get me wrong those two games were still shit but we were deffo improved.,Liverpool,Yes,j768zbv,t1_j767kxq
lol,Liverpool,Yes,j77fmra,t1_j767kxq
Got to wonder if there might be something going on behind the scenes with him,Liverpool,Yes,j76njh3,t1_j76mkz8
Yep. Their pressing is decent.,Liverpool,Yes,j76fguk,t1_j76fa89
tbf their press has been good. They are not just parking the bus.,Liverpool,Yes,j76l8dm,t1_j76kzkw
His experience and leadership could be key in the title race + more legs in midfield is always good,Liverpool,Yes,j76p2bi,t1_j76owg4
"Bellingham is a red herring at this point.

The club has significant issues with departing personnel and general professionalism that don't seem to be dealt with with any urgency. Then there's the overall question of ownership change and investment. 

Finally there's the issues on the pitch, which are incredibly varied, and aren't going to be solved by one player.

It's much more important that we get rid of many players and have a very lean squad next year since we won't be in Europe and need to rebuild. More important who goes than who comes in.",Liverpool,Yes,j77dvlh,t1_j77bi90
"Salah has always been a goalscorer not a winger which is why I used to cringe when I saw Messi and Hazards comparisons. Salah can't hold a candle to that level of playmaking from wide but he can get close to Messi goal numbers which is valuable in it's own right.

Once you put Nunez/Gakpo there, take away his space, and ask him to be an actual winger this is exactly what you get. I don't get this rebuild from Klopp at all. Make no mistake Nunez 100% his signing.",Liverpool,Yes,j77do4q,t1_j77cmjy
I mean I knew a season like this was coming eventually. The pressure of having to win literally every game and get 100 points for 4 straight years and playing with intensity we do was going to let up eventually.,Liverpool,Yes,j77j6u3,t1_j77h3aw
"Our midfield would get out run, but I don't see them scoring. They can't find the back of the net",Liverpool,Yes,j76gkdy,t1_j76geox

Once they are relegated he‚Äôs more than welcome.,Liverpool,Yes,j76g410,t1_j76g1ao
Said this before West Ham we‚Äôre in for him we should have been having that lad. A monster of anplayer and loyal too it seems,Liverpool,Yes,j76jiin,t1_j76g1ao
"You mean will he start the only player who has scored for the club in the past 3 games- or we want to laugh at the very idea?

Liverpool fans, man. Every day I see a greater gap between the word fan and the word supporter.",Liverpool,Yes,j765mly,t1_j75x4cf
I think he plays Elliott. Darwin isn't playing well enough to start,Liverpool,Yes,j75yrb5,t1_j75x4cf
"He's definitely got them believing they can play football again, though I don't know if he'll keep them composed enough to the end of the season.",Liverpool,Yes,j76o6zq,t1_j76nv2g
"I was shocked when I saw all of the people going after Klopp for that. If Klopp is mad at him I know it‚Äôs for a good reason, Ill back Klopp over Pearce no matter what. Pearce has also been a joke of a ‚Äújournalist‚Äù for a long time. He deflects all blame off of FSG towards the coaching staff.",Liverpool,Yes,j789btr,t1_j77pyki
Anguissa completely dominated on napoli home iirc,Liverpool,Yes,j76l0jw,t1_j76kvkq
That cost money which fsg are allergic to spending and would expose them,Liverpool,Yes,j77ah0r,t1_j7796ow
They are on 50 points 19 games in. That's good even by the standard us and City set these past years.,Liverpool,Yes,j76hg9e,t1_j76g5f3
"You're just being entitled, we're doing perfectly fine with our 19 year old winger from the championship as our main midfielder",Liverpool,Yes,j76lapo,t1_j76jhe1
"""Because they're not the right midfielders""",Liverpool,Yes,j76jucp,t1_j76jhe1
Our owners want to get the money back for loans they gave us instead of strengthening the squad,Liverpool,Yes,j76jvw5,t1_j76jhe1
"Oh, I've been here many times. I've been watching this team since I was born, about 32 of which I remember.

It's mostly been shit. I know this feeling well. I know how people are going to crucify nice people giving their all for the club, I know how people will trott out the same platitudes, and ignore context. It's football.",Liverpool,Yes,j77eabu,t1_j77acdw
"I'm indifferent because the last few years have been the best of times and I have full faith in Klopp. You can't have sustained success of that level, 3 CL Finals in 5 years, 90+ seasons and winning the absolute lot in that period.",Liverpool,Yes,j77atpl,t1_j77acdw
Not really. They fought hard and no arguments that they deserved 3 points.,Liverpool,Yes,j76pf89,t1_j76p0o4
They outplayed Arsenal tbh,Liverpool,Yes,j76pn1f,t1_j76p0o4
Hope the bald demon saves football,Liverpool,Yes,j76rfce,t1_j76pw3i
Hope they lose by 2 points,Liverpool,Yes,j76w52c,t1_j76pw3i
I'd rather Arsenal than City.,Liverpool,Yes,j76rvln,t1_j76pw3i
There was clear signs we needed some midfielders since the summer window and FSG decide getting the money from the club for its debt was the best kind of transaction.,Liverpool,Yes,j772mus,t1_j7720eu
"Scum signed Eriksen as a free agent, Tielemans can also turn good, I think it‚Äôs a no brained since 2-3 midfield players will leave Liverpool this summer and we will need depth, he won‚Äôt be on astronomical wages as well",Liverpool,Yes,j7600ie,t1_j75z46u
"I think he‚Äôs a decent player, and could help the squad, but i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs started quality and I think he‚Äôd want to be starting wherever he goes. 

Plus I know it‚Äôs absolutely to his credit that he‚Äôs already played like 500 games at his age, but I would see that as a potential concern too; that he also has the potential to start declining / picking up injuries soon. Maybe that‚Äôs just paranoia on my part. I think of Owen saying he always feels he played too much too young; I believe Lallana had played a crazy amount of games for Southampton over the years before we signed him too. 

And free signing also doesn‚Äôt mean there wouldn‚Äôt be a sizeable signing on fee either. For me, I wouldn‚Äôt take him unless about 3-4 other key targets went elsewhere. 

I also feel like he‚Äôs probably got the club he wants to sign for lined up already, he‚Äôll likely be one of the first players to sign for a club this summer.",Liverpool,Yes,j765h1a,t1_j75z46u
"Tielemans is a talented player but I have doubts about 2 aspects of his game. His willingness/ability to press/defend aggressively and his mentality. He looks similar to Thiago but Thiago at his best defends relentlessly and tackles without hesitation. I'm not sure Tielemans can do that. Additionally, people last season were criticising his ""body language"". That's a pretty vague accusation, but it's also a problem we have this season.

My take is that we could sign him, but as a bonus to Jude and a more defensive midfielder.",Liverpool,Yes,j75zvdo,t1_j75z46u
"Better options available for lesser package. Free agent is also costly with agent fees,sign on bonus, higher wage than regular.",Liverpool,Yes,j762bsj,t1_j75z46u
No. He's not very good.,Liverpool,Yes,j7633i7,t1_j75z46u
They have led me to support everton for 1 match.,Liverpool,Yes,j76ktwj,t1_j76kcqu
They're by far the most unbareable fan base and I quite like them as a club as well but the online fans are a different breed from any other teams.,Liverpool,Yes,j76kqkf,t1_j76kcqu
All the yanks have come out with their Arsenal flairs talking about flops and cleats and they‚Äôre fucking insufferable.,Liverpool,Yes,j76kkhq,t1_j76kcqu
They are making our finishing look clinical,Liverpool,Yes,j76iz70,t1_j76in65
Hopefully they win need spurs to drop points,Liverpool,Yes,j76n7z5,t1_j76n2tu
Spurs never roll over against them so i'd imagine it will be another great game.,Liverpool,Yes,j76n8jm,t1_j76n2tu
"Nah they‚Äôll smell blood, peps let his mate have a good run so he keeps his job, pep wills team roll the league now. Arteta goes back to being a Pictionary loving meme next season",Liverpool,Yes,j76okvb,t1_j76n2tu
Best we can do is Elliot-Gakpo-Salah with Nunez coming on in the 70th min and have no time to build into the game.,Liverpool,Yes,j76m0fr,t1_j76lc4j
We won‚Äôt,Liverpool,Yes,j76lift,t1_j76lc4j
So Gakpo #10?,Liverpool,Yes,j76llt3,t1_j76lc4j
No one else wanted us to win the league so why should we care if it doesn‚Äôt involve us,Liverpool,Yes,j76odac,t1_j76o3ci
Most of us don‚Äôt wank over owners or bang on about them every two minutes,Liverpool,Yes,j76ocwa,t1_j76o3ci
"I'm just petty and want a team besides us to know what it's like to lose out on the title to Man City.

If we have to get all the ""top at Christmas/didn't win the league"" shit, I'd like it to haunt another set of fans too lol",Liverpool,Yes,j76ooh0,t1_j76o3ci
"Citys soul has long since been sold, ours hasn't",Liverpool,Yes,j76on2c,t1_j76o3ci
My guess is it's not wanting City to win as much as it's not wanting Arsenal to win.,Liverpool,Yes,j76perw,t1_j76o3ci
People view City as a person playing with cheatcodes. It hurts less because a 'real' person didn't beat you.,Liverpool,Yes,j76pr99,t1_j76o3ci
"I agree, we are watching a team not playing for their manager every time they go on the pitch. Week in week out. 

Even with three top signings that doesn‚Äôt change",Liverpool,Yes,j76xf3n,t1_j76vup7
Give me a managers name who can win with a transfer budget of 5 million plus sales,Liverpool,Yes,j77as1e,t1_j776y1e
"Nunez was a great move, but any player being the only move was a bad idea. We needed Nunez for the future and at least one player who could play in the midfield this year, and yet‚Ä¶",Liverpool,Yes,j77jl80,t1_j77fbbj
Yeah he's good but people talk him up as some special quality of player when its not really the case,Liverpool,Yes,j76k4nu,t1_j76k0f8
I've never understood the Zinchenko hate.,Liverpool,Yes,j76kcdu,t1_j76k0f8
It feels very similar to the Newcastle game they drew they seem to struggle to break down physical sides,Liverpool,Yes,j76l9tk,t1_j76l4si
"I‚Äôm surprised how many people would rather city win it than arsenal, I personally dislike city more than united haha.",Liverpool,Yes,j76mwm6,t1_j76mi5y
"Sure he looks out of ideas, but he has created success out of nothing since he arrived. It was never gonna last with our transfer strategy. 

Blaming Klopp under these circumstances is like blaming the race car driver when the owner refuses to pay for maintenance on the car.",Liverpool,Yes,j773yge,t1_j772isy
Klopp should probably think about changing system before he does anything,Liverpool,Yes,j777esh,t1_j776z9f
We wouldn't have Klopp anymore I think.,Liverpool,Yes,j777lv3,t1_j776z9f

It's like a Mersey side curse,Liverpool,Yes,j76hjv5,t1_j76hdwd
"I tell you what, they don't look half bad today. Regardless of what happens I think Everton have played really well.",Liverpool,Yes,j76mfns,t1_j76m3l0
"Neuhaus is shit, Tonali won‚Äôt leave Milan, Laimer just joined Bayern, Brozovic isn‚Äôt in our age bracket, Ward prowse would be overpriced and isn‚Äôt that good, Valverde would be more expensive than Jude, Milinkovic savic is probably slightly too old, Chelsea might go for Zakaria 

The rest I think we could get",Liverpool,Yes,j760kxj,t1_j7609ub
"There are other options aswell 
Manuel ugarte
Kouadio Kone
Khepren thuram
Enzo le fee
Martin zubimendi
Dominik szobslai 
Matheus Nunes.
 
If we were given the funds i would say sign Bellingham, ugarte,Nunes. Scalvini he's been impressive in serie a for Atalanta.  he can play as 6, CB with matip aging he could be great option to add.",Liverpool,Yes,j7625ml,t1_j7609ub
"With Ox leaving we need to be looking at bringing in a new homegrown player, and fortunately there's quite a few that could be available in the summer.

Rice has 2 years on his contract and is absolutely top class so I'd be very surprised if he doesn't move in the summer. I'd expect both Arsenal and City to be in for him, as well as maybe United. I think we should be looking at him but given its a domestic deal we should bail if the price goes too high.

Obviously Bellingham should be number 1 priority, and while I don't think he'll end up here, we should absolutely be doing everything we can to make his decision difficult. Only downside to this one is that I don't think he counts as homegrown, but that shouldn't stop us trying for him.

Ward-Prowse would be cheap and has a great fitness record, but he's also 28 so probably isn't quite the age profile we're after. I do think he'd be a good deal alongside some younger players though.

I also reckon we look at Gallagher and Mount too, but it'll all depend on who else is involved and what they're prepared to pay. Mount signing a new contract will also close that door.",Liverpool,Yes,j7675lt,t1_j7609ub

If their midfield is so good then why are they just above relegation?,Liverpool,Yes,j769u3k,t1_j75svx4
"I think you're overrating that midfield a bit but more crucially massively underrating some of the others out there. Arsenal, United, Newcastle, Brighton all have a better midfield in my eyes. I think if their players are fit Chelsea do too.",Liverpool,Yes,j767q4e,t1_j75svx4

"I agree in principle but City are patchy by their standards also, it's Arsenal's to lose",Liverpool,Yes,j76ez0u,t1_j76evhj
"Let‚Äôs be real, our attack this season has mostly consisted of spamming crosses",Liverpool,Yes,j76hki8,t1_j76hco7
"Any manager we get will need reinvestment. 

FSG aren't able to do that, Klopp can't manage this team and therefore we need a relegation battling manager to help us survive. 

Guess bring in Harry Redknapp ü§™",Liverpool,Yes,j787eo2,t1_j77ok39
"Indeed we are, although it won't happen because FSG are too cheap to sack him. Plus they don't watch football or check the league standings until May.",Liverpool,Yes,j77x59r,t1_j77ok39

Nunez (70m) and Gakpo (40m) have absolutely stunk the gaff out and been significantly worse than the player we sold in summer.,Liverpool,Yes,j771gr8,t1_j770n8l
"This is a common theme this season, I can‚Äôt understand why we keep doing it.

It was so obvious Gomez just needed to cut the passing lane, it‚Äôs fairly sure it‚Äôs defending 101",Liverpool,Yes,j777g53,t1_j776n42
Annoyingly we're at Anfield too. If it was the Goodison leg it's always a draw anyway so I wouldn't be arsed.,Liverpool,Yes,j766hk0,t1_j7653ig
Very true,Liverpool,Yes,j76xuep,t1_j76xnrm
Hopefully he keep them in eternal 17th limbo. Would hate to see them going down. 17th is just perfect for them.,Liverpool,Yes,j76py00,t1_j76ppl5
Please don't bring his personal life into this when you don't know him like that,Liverpool,Yes,j77d827,t1_j77bq40
Fabinho was a big problem that has been partially fixed. That isn't to say he was the only problem and nobody has really even pretended otherwise.,Liverpool,Yes,j77f81o,t1_j77en7k
"Yeah. It feels like we‚Äôre to the point with Gomez and Matip that we were with fab a month ago. They‚Äôre showing us no reason why they should remain in the squad (especially Gomez) but Klopp is being stubborn. I expect this performance will be the last of Gomez starting for a while. But honestly, both of them deserve to be benched. 

Do we know how long Ibou is going to be out? Is it the famous LFC fortnight?",Liverpool,Yes,j77jb61,t1_j77gcrq
Anthony Gordon isnt the reason they are 3rd on the table,Liverpool,Yes,j77h29w,t1_j77gyld
"They did also sign Isak for over ¬£70m as well and he's played less than 10 games so far for them. They've spent a shitload and also used it wisely, spreading it across the entire squad and the bench too.",Liverpool,Yes,j77id6r,t1_j77gyld
Arteta is mad overrated and he‚Äôs just riding his luck at the moment. That‚Äôs a hill I‚Äôll die on,Liverpool,Yes,j76j6gm,t1_j76gzh1
"I don't think so ? Because he doesn't fund anything it's all club revenue. It was the sale of mane, Nico Williams, minamino ect",Liverpool,Yes,j77cah0,t1_j77bzvi
"I get the sarcasm lad but I do think two games against sides in the bottom 6 and one against a Newcastle team without Guimar√£es are winnable.

Plus a bit of optimism beats the depression when you come on here and look at the comments.",Liverpool,Yes,j760gzv,t1_j75y1gc
"Best I can do is 20 of the next 48. 

Unless I did the maths wrong, that's our current PL winrate.",Liverpool,Yes,j76cqg2,t1_j75y1gc
If he's in training this week with no setbacks he'll make the bench for the derby next week,Liverpool,Yes,j75z35j,t1_j75qfsm
"Occasionally you see people somehow still have faith in him. He's had a single good season and that was when Van Dijk and the midfield were at their height of physicality, making up for his braindead mistakes.",Liverpool,Yes,j77ipy7,t1_j77i2x7
Imagine being Salah getting paid out the ass to play like complete shit,Liverpool,Yes,j7788ur,t1_j772ivs
Yeah it's no excuse when you're on 400k a week but you look on the left wing earlier this season and you see....Ox with Hendo and Fabinho stinking it up in the midfield behind you it's understandable to some degree.,Liverpool,Yes,j773j5o,t1_j772ivs
">Salah has always been a goalscorer not a winger which is why I used to cringe when I saw Messi and Hazards comparisons. Salah can't hold a candle to that level of playmaking from wide

He was top assister in the PL last season, he can't even beat a man in 1v1 now like he used to.",Liverpool,Yes,j77es5w,t1_j77do4q
"Of course, well said. The team is completely burnt out and has to be practically rebuilt from the ground up.",Liverpool,Yes,j77xzj4,t1_j77j6u3
Scrappy 0-0 it is then,Liverpool,Yes,j76gngu,t1_j76gkdy
0% chance of them going down under dyche,Liverpool,Yes,j76gazf,t1_j76g410
He couldn‚Äôt leave in January anyway even if he wanted to had already played for two clubs this season,Liverpool,Yes,j76jvah,t1_j76jiin
I have no issues with Elliott playing but if he's going to play then play him on the right where he's far more comfortable. I'm sure you'll probably have something to say about Salah being dropped in that case though.,Liverpool,Yes,j7662sg,t1_j765mly
"He's only not started the last couple because he's been coming back from an injury, unless there's still injury concerns he starts today",Liverpool,Yes,j763ibt,t1_j75yrb5
Yep. And costs only for 15 millions for Napoli for Fulham.,Liverpool,Yes,j76l9qu,t1_j76l0jw
League has been the worst it‚Äôs been in years this seapsnS,Liverpool,Yes,j76jghz,t1_j76hg9e
"> instead of strengthening the squad

Wonder how we paid for Gakpo then",Liverpool,Yes,j76ka9m,t1_j76jvw5
"I mean, I'd say we could have sustained it if we had made smart transfer decisions.",Liverpool,Yes,j77c0qa,t1_j77atpl
"I am indifferent because I don‚Äòt have any confidence whatsoever in our ownership. At least in 20/21 I felt like this was all just a matter of our CBs getting healthy (which it was). Now I feel like it‚Äòs a matter of needing a new CB to replace Matip or Gomez, a back-up RB, a new quality back-up goalkeeper because Kelleher should be allowed to leave, a Fabinho replacement & 3 new CMs. There‚Äòs no way on earth we‚Äòll do half of that in the summer with FSG.
I‚Äòm not asking for 90+ points every season and CL finals every other year, but we‚Äòre getting embarrassed by the worst teams in the league. There‚Äòs serious issues at the club.",Liverpool,Yes,j77bmdk,t1_j77atpl
"Not without backing you can‚Äôt.. This crisis was promised and had to happen with the current owner. 

Could‚Äôve been a dynasty ‚Ä¶",Liverpool,Yes,j77bv2i,t1_j77atpl
You want to see Klopp getting compared to Arteta? Fuck that dude.,Liverpool,Yes,j76sbvt,t1_j76rvln
"Still United for me, bunch of utter cunts",Liverpool,Yes,j76ky6k,t1_j76kqkf
Reading the match threads and you‚Äôd honestly think there‚Äôs a conspiracy against them the way they constantly talk about it. Really odd.,Liverpool,Yes,j76kpsl,t1_j76kkhq
"People are scared to admit it but it just seems to obvious at this point, changed the midfield and its still the same.

Down to him to chanage the system and we haven't done that either.",Liverpool,Yes,j76xnex,t1_j76xf3n
"Terrible take and tired of hearing this nonsense. Everton just beat Arsenal today, Klopp hasn‚Äôt won a game convincingly since Rangers",Liverpool,Yes,j77ep0f,t1_j77as1e
Accurately rating an above average player as above average is hate? Too many closeted arsana fans in here,Liverpool,Yes,j76kxte,t1_j76kcdu
"Mix between atmosphere and a team fighting for everything is really not easy to play against, we've seen it many times over the years but most of the time we found a way to win.",Liverpool,Yes,j76ljbj,t1_j76l9tk
There's plenty of games like this in a season. Play enough of them and eventually you'll drop points. I think people underestimate just how tight a lot of games are.,Liverpool,Yes,j76mnui,t1_j76l9tk
I can't believe how many people rather Arsenal not get the title than Everton get relegated.,Liverpool,Yes,j76ox5v,t1_j76mwm6
"The team we have been using is more than good enough to be playing much better than what we have been.

We're back to the 4-3-3 after it not working in the 1st half of the season and are no percistent on using while the results are still shit, at that point you need to look at the manager.,",Liverpool,Yes,j77472p,t1_j773yge
"Fair points, Jude and Pellegrini it is then!



If we were sticking to a younger bracket would you have any of Gravenberch, Jacob Ramsey, Caicedo or Mount?",Liverpool,Yes,j761s89,t1_j760kxj
"I've only seen Enzo Le Fee a handful of time but he did seem pretty good to be fair, Szobslai I know was meant to be Red Bulls next big thing but thought (maybe incorrectly) he played predominantly further forward?",Liverpool,Yes,j764ly4,t1_j7625ml
"In keeping with our grim-ish FSG reality, i think we'll sign Jude, and that's it..which is not enough for a title challenge next season.

I'd be shocked (and overjoyed) if we try for and get Rice. I'd love Tielemans on a free.

Once we land the key targets, squad depth can be built by a couple of HG players here and there. A HG keeper (let Adrian go), Gomez, Nat, Milner, Hendo, Kelleher, Trent, Curtis are what we expect to have. If we sell Kelleher, get another HG backup keeper..if we sell Nat, get someone from one of the newly relegated/promoted sides.",Liverpool,Yes,j76hslc,t1_j7675lt
Yup,Liverpool,Yes,j779mjd,t1_j75ywhy
Because they've just signed gomes and are struggling to score? If our midfield is so bad how are we challenging european spots? Theres more to a team than a midfield.,Liverpool,Yes,j76a9rj,t1_j769u3k
"That's why I said on paper because it's yet to be put in to practice. All 3 Neves, Gomes and Nunes are technically world class. You've got a box to box set piece specialist in Neves. A technically gifted destroyer in Gomes and a very creative player in Nunes. Not many teams have 3 that should compliment each other so well. Reminds me of our Mascherano, Alonso and Gerrard midfield. Wolves are only lacking in goals, once they figure out how to score they'll be challenging for Europe again easily.",Liverpool,Yes,j769oqs,t1_j767q4e
It's because you and your ilk say the same shite every single summer.,Liverpool,Yes,j77bf8d,t1_j77b5hk
"Nobody‚Äôs downvoted them so why you shadow boxing? Reality is FSG aren‚Äôt the ONLY reason, they‚Äôre a huge part but we‚Äôre playing like shit, that‚Äôs on Klopp and the players. We have money for Gakpo, did we need Gakpo? No we needed a midfielder. Everyone should be embarrassed",Liverpool,Yes,j77ckmu,t1_j77b5hk
Salah has entered the chat,Liverpool,Yes,j76hiah,t1_j76g9g2
"None of these lads actually think before they post, it's unreal.",Liverpool,Yes,j77doye,t1_j77dlmv
"for the fee we would have paid, <20m, he would have been a superb signing for the squad.",Liverpool,Yes,j76czhs,t1_j76ctfo
"The only thing Jones has going for him is his age.
Looked a bit in most competitive games, run into the corner and back pass, rinse and repeat",Liverpool,Yes,j76g2xz,t1_j76dugg
Onana and Iwobi gets into our midfield,Liverpool,Yes,j76e91k,t1_j76dn2g
"They're bottom of the table because they have no one who can score, not because of their midfield. 15 goals is a putrid output. Iwobi is only a winger right now, but he was a CM with Lampard and he and Onana bossed our midfield. That game was so frustrating to watch.",Liverpool,Yes,j76gehh,t1_j76dn2g
Legs are a talent too I guess,Liverpool,Yes,j76gp10,t1_j76ggvo
because them winning it is not an achievement.,Liverpool,Yes,j77198k,t1_j76totv
I know that. But some still show them‚Ä¶sneakily. I‚Äôm just not sure where anymore since having a fire stick is one of the worst crimes in this country currently.,Liverpool,Yes,j75xbrf,t1_j75wvap
"A CB could be huge, but I don‚Äôt think we get another one unless Matip is sold.
 
Another strict DM doesn‚Äôt come in unless Fab is sold either. Otherwise you‚Äôre basically killing Bajcetic‚Äôs route into the first team. 

A RW doesn‚Äôt come in unless you sell Salah, as Elliot, Jota, Diaz, Doak, and Gordon can all play there for the 8 games a so a season that Salah isn‚Äôt starting. 

There are only so many spaces in the squad. We will 100% need a few midfielders, but beyond that it would take quite a fire sale to free up all those spaces for extra investment.",Liverpool,Yes,j7664h4,t1_j75rhg2
People will look at this and thing you‚Äôre crazy. But this really is what is needed if we want to get back to competing for trophies. FSG let this squad decay so much that we now have to have a MASSIVE window in the summer.,Liverpool,Yes,j76c79t,t1_j75rhg2
Well we do hope FSG will be gone but i dont think it will happen so soon. I also dont think we will buy Jude. People on here spout his name like its a god given right for us to buy him! Its ridiculous how so many top clubs in this country including us let him go to Dortmund when every man and their dog knew Birmingham were gonna sell him. He is out of FSG‚Äôs price range. Can never see them spending ¬£100m plus on one player. Lets not forget the Darwin deal is only around ‚Ç¨80m with add-ons. I also wanna add that Klopp is an amazing coach and he has the ability to make a ¬£40m-¬£50m midfielder just as good as Jude. Klopp signed a new contract less than a year ago. He is here to stay and develop players. I belive we will buy outliers thst are not so expensive.,Liverpool,Yes,j75srl2,t1_j75rhg2
"No no, I mean genuine conversations and discussions with family or friends irl. From people that dont actively dislike the club.",Liverpool,Yes,j77jjpz,t1_j77inao
"Ah, never watched Pep‚Äôs Bayern , I guess I‚Äôm just now noticing.",Liverpool,Yes,j76edrg,t1_j76ea2h
"last season aswell, he has been doing this for a while",Liverpool,Yes,j76gvy5,t1_j76e6mh
"Maybe I‚Äôve just failed to notice in the past, but they seem to be pushing more central in possession like a true cm rather than drifting inside.",Liverpool,Yes,j76e5fa,t1_j76dytq
"His passing is really good tbf. Lot of players do no look passing for the lulz, he actually does it effectively to make really clever vertical passes",Liverpool,Yes,j76lxvy,t1_j76lbxn
I just hate to see people turn on him. He's been the best Liverpool Manager in the prem era,Liverpool,Yes,j77fwud,t1_j77fktw
Presumably home games and VVD/Jota/Firmino will help us struggle to 12th or something but genuinely not sure where we go from here. Completely fucked it,Liverpool,Yes,j78o4ab,t1_j78l58x
"FSG have no idea what's going on, they don't watch any games.

They're in for a surprise when they do their annual table check in May lol",Liverpool,Yes,j77yvok,t1_j77d43q

"Ah, he‚Äôll fit perfectly",Liverpool,Yes,j76aidj,t1_j768cey
how about we use curtis jones who we gave a new contact to? use ox and milner aswell they‚Äôre way better than those two,Liverpool,Yes,j76n2np,t1_j76mrbn

"Yeah, my point is he‚Äôs got no composure what so ever, I‚Äôd literally prefer anyone there",Liverpool,Yes,j774p0j,t1_j774l4s
It's the tackling with long legs I'm talking about. Should have made it more clear.,Liverpool,Yes,j76mlbf,t1_j76mfk4
"We can bench him too. Yes, he has a killer pass in him, but if he cannot defend well, what is the point??",Liverpool,Yes,j77uhnb,t1_j77n6ur
"Hendo and Fab have been dropped of late, so don‚Äôt see Thiago deserves to keep starting. He has been utter poo of late but starts every game. Give Curtis and Ox a run out in the two 8‚Äôs. At least they will be fresh and bring energy to the table.",Liverpool,Yes,j78d6dk,t1_j77a0p5
">Eh? No ones stopped ""supporting"" lad!

Have you seen the reaction from the usual bottom reds?",Liverpool,Yes,j77c80w,t1_j77bxwl

"I mean you couldn't, but go off",Liverpool,Yes,j77jt0h,t1_j77i82n
nah Citeh are awake now. This sort of stretch is their domain. Look how they ripped Spurs apart,Liverpool,Yes,j76g5d5,t1_j76ez0u
I don‚Äôt think we have done enough of that this season. We barely create anymore,Liverpool,Yes,j76hq2q,t1_j76hki8
"Absolute wally. If he's not given the financial backing, what makes you think any other manager can change things?",Liverpool,Yes,j77yulr,t1_j77x59r
We are supposed to ease them out while relying on Diaz and Jota. This season is cursed.,Liverpool,Yes,j772lsx,t1_j771gr8
"I actually think Dyche with money gets them into European places eventually. They'll be limited by FFP for a while but if they stick with him, they'll go places. His football isn't as one-dimensional as it's perceived to be if he actually has decent personnel.",Liverpool,Yes,j76q4uc,t1_j76py00
"Haha fuck off mate, it's not some intrusion into his privacy, we're chatting on the internet and it's just an observation. Lost people in your life and had it affect you? I have. It's not some mark of shame against me. Grow up.",Liverpool,Yes,j77e1up,t1_j77d827
"What problem was fixed exactly? We were absolutely no better in midfield or the DM area today than at any other point in the season. I don‚Äôt think the problem is the DM anyway, I think it‚Äôs the selection of players we have in midfield. Literally no presence",Liverpool,Yes,j77fvd3,t1_j77f81o
"Right but to answer your original question; it's not ""smart spending"" it's *lucky* spending. Isak for 70m, Trippier for 12m.",Liverpool,Yes,j77lkyt,t1_j77h29w
"Yes, that's how football works for most clubs. You spend what you earn.",Liverpool,Yes,j77coej,t1_j77cah0

He‚Äôs been atrocious for a long time. Agreed.,Liverpool,Yes,j778nx0,t1_j7788ur
"I mean he never could consistently beat a man 1v1. He had flashes where he did but never in the same way other players do where it's either I get by you or you foul me, there's no other outcomes.",Liverpool,Yes,j77fx0q,t1_j77es5w
It‚Äôll be an end to end 0-0 as no one can hit the target at the moment,Liverpool,Yes,j76grvj,t1_j76gngu

Gotta agree. United and Chelsea are much worse IMO,Liverpool,Yes,j76ldyq,t1_j76ky6k
They're cunts but Arsenal fans on Twitter especially are unmatched in delusion,Liverpool,Yes,j76l6z0,t1_j76ky6k

Yea because saying a rival player is good is being a closeted Arsenal fan? Get your head out of your ass you tribal bum.,Liverpool,Yes,j76l44x,t1_j76kxte
Everton deserve to be in front they have been by far the better team today,Liverpool,Yes,j76n068,t1_j76mnui
I‚Äôd have any of those in a heartbeat but I‚Äôm not so sure about Mount. He‚Äôs been amazing in previous seasons but this season he‚Äôs been terrible,Liverpool,Yes,j762wvs,t1_j761s89
"If Bellingham played holding midfield, I reckon just his signing would be enough for us to get top 4, provided we have no European football at all next year. Given he's not we may struggle if Bajcetic isn't up to the job. Bellingham plus Rice though I think genuinely puts us as title challengers.

We're really not as far off as some on here would have us believe. Our squad at the moment is inflated because we've got so many players who can't stay fit. If we can bring in two good options as holding midfield and the right side of midfield we'll have a top class first team. As you say there's then some surgery to be done lower down the squad ladder, but with Kelleher and Phillips out we can probably offset our costs of doing that pretty well. I'm also optimistic Ramsey will come good next year, so really the only work that needs doing is in centre midfield, centre half, and goalkeeper.",Liverpool,Yes,j76kb8o,t1_j76hslc

Weird that armchair managers here seen it coming for ages hmmm",Liverpool,Yes,j77cw8c,t1_j77bf8d
"A club with our recorded revenue shouldn‚Äôt have to choose between Gakpo or a midfielder? The Lynch article the other day mentioned debt repayment being made the priority over transfer funds, hence Klopp is only allowed to address one weakness.",Liverpool,Yes,j77de1c,t1_j77ckmu
We needed a forward and a midfielder.,Liverpool,Yes,j77dz0m,t1_j77ckmu

Nobody ‚Äúlet‚Äù him go to dortmund. He chose dortmund because it was the best place for his development. He even took less money because that‚Äôs where they felt would be the best step for his career. He turned down multiple clubs in favour of it.,Liverpool,Yes,j75twgv,t1_j75srl2
"What they're referring to, and what you're referring to, are different things.

">who want dirt money and don‚Äôt care about the history of the club

FSG literally ate all of our UCL, PL money and furloughed our staff until they realised it's not good for their social status so they reverted it.

If we just ran the club on ticket sales, marketing, video rights, subscriptions, shirt sales and transfers, we'd have more transfer money than what FSG provided.

"Yeah, with Jude and Rice, we should be back up close to the top, but unlikely those 2 are executed with FSG in charge. I also think that for a real title push, we'll need a CB addition.

So you aren‚Äôt able to tell me what problem was fixed? But also I‚Äôm crazy if I can‚Äôt see it? Didn‚Äôt we just lose 3-0 or did I miss something,Liverpool,Yes,j77j9pi,t1_j77glxd

Thiago hasn‚Äôt been up to his high standards 100% but he hasn‚Äôt been bad enough for him to be dropped for the likes of Jones and Ox. Even keita looks absolutely horrendous every game. We don‚Äôt have players capable of taking his place. 

No one should be immune from being dropped but we just don‚Äôt have the quality to replace him. It‚Äôs the same with Salah. He‚Äôs been shite all season but who‚Äôs gonna come in and take his place?",Liverpool,Yes,j7az0ko,t1_j7afv3c
"First of all, I'm flattered! Second, when it comes to who owns us you're absolutely correct. Couldn't really give a shit who wins the title if it isn't us, but if that's the choice from the rest of the pack then City is the less annoying option.",Liverpool,Yes,j76lz9n,t1_j76ijr6
"Okay, the problem that we fixed was having a slow, immobile DM who couldn't tackle to save his life. He was of course not the only problem, but he was a huge one.

Now, instead of him, we have a young, agile DM with tenacity and good pressing that must have made at least 5 successful tackles today.

> Didn‚Äôt we just lose 3-0 or did I miss something

It's possible for players to be good even in a heavy loss, you know that right? And the problems we had today are completely different from what we've suffered all season.",Liverpool,Yes,j77jq6n,t1_j77j9pi

"Klopp is to loyal to certain players for sure but he‚Äôs not the one that dictates the amount available for transfers. I think FSG knows how good of a manager he is and tried riding the magic wave without putting in much effort for themselves.

"Trent, Robbo, VVD, Alisson, Matip, Fabinho. All signed contract extensions in the last couple seasons. Should the club have let them go or retained the best players in the world at the time?

Only Liverpool.",Liverpool,Yes,j78u6eg,t1_j78do9n

"So a hypocrite, yeah. Not surprised.",Liverpool,Yes,j76n4b1,t1_j76lz9n
"The only reason we want our DM sprinting around the pitch is because we have no shape or balance in the midfield. For the time being yes it makes sense to have some mobility in that position so fair enough I understand your point, but it‚Äôs crazy to think we can rescue this season with Stefan DM and nothing else. It‚Äôs not going to make the slightest bit of difference whether Stef plays or Fab plays, the biggest problem is coming from elsewhere",Liverpool,Yes,j77ke93,t1_j77jq6n

"We'rer stuck with Keita and Ox because they're always injured so no club will want to take them and they're also both on minimum 120k a week.

¬£30m-¬£40m signings aren't risky at all.",Liverpool,Yes,j76ocfh,t1_j76nxun
"Uhhhh. If Ronaldo doesn't do his interview he is still at United? United still have multiple players over 200k. Martial earning more than every player at Liverpool bar Salah. 

Madrid replaced Casemerio and if his wage demands were too high, he still transferred to Utd who must have paid an equivalent salary. Replaced Varane and had United pay those wages.

Barca has almost nothing to do with choosing wages but the transfers themselves. The problem was signing multiple players on over 400k, players not accepting pay cuts during covid and then wanting to replace them because they turned out bad. No one wanted to buy them and players didn't wanna leave in transfers that would reduce their wages. Essential if Barca could sell those players and get new they wanted, they wouldn't have a problem. Instead they had unwanted players, who refused pay cuts during Covid, who they couldn't sell

All of these clubs have done transfers and signed players on high wages as opposed to Liverpool where our top earners all earned their high contracts.  
Example being Trent and Robbo combined being a 100k. They are both now on over 100k each. Which they've earned. 
 That should not affect transfers at a Club the level of Liverpool",Liverpool,Yes,j7a5jjl,t1_j78upwg
"I have a shocking news for you, if you're still believe that we genuinely interested in Bellingham and not in PR. He isn't coming (without takeover). Out of our price range and ambitions completely.

"Klopp was in a much better mood in the presser, and actually shared some interesting insights about the struggles of specific players (e.g., Fab), and the team as a whole. Plus he shared some positive injury updates (Jota full team training next week, Bobby and Virg very close to team training, Diaz running outside, etc.)

We all know the club is in a precarious, uncertain position, but I still don't doubt Klopp has the joy and passion within him to keep going and get this team clicking again. Been a lot of chat about him being burnt out, and while he definitely has seemed tired and defensive at points this campaign, I believe he is very motivated by specific challenges and doesn't pity himself or shy away from them. That's what you need in tough times - though obviously the results need to start matching the rhetoric. 

My feeling a renewed sense of calm, patience, and confidence in Klopp only fuels my frustration with the past two transfer windows however.

Diaz, Gakpo, and Nunez are all *good* players, with Gakpo and Nunez being overpriced quite a bit, mostly due to interest from elsewhere. 

I really don't understand the calls for their sackings when it's clear that the entire club is suffering from some kind of hangover from last year.",Liverpool,Yes,j73ky6l,t1_j72oupa

"It's hard for people to be angry and think coherently about a wider range of issues all at once. It usually requires people to calm down and read, or listen to opinions outside their own head. This all requires effort. And nuance. And an ego willing to accept that it doesn't already know everything. And these things are rare, particuarly when so much of the response in football in very primitive ego triggering in the first place.

For example: we shit on FSG because they haven't even spent as much money as Spurs! Spurs for christ-sake! And then Spurs fans shit on Levy because he hasn't spent as much as Arsenal! Arsenal for christ-sake! And for now Arsenal are calm because they're winning - but plenty of their fans were calling for Arteta's head 18 months ago. And raging at the owners because they hadn't spent as much as United! The point being, its this constant egoic battle of someone else having more, so you feel like less. Someone else has more points, spends more money, has a squad closer to the peak of their ability -- and therefore you feel like less. And when you feel like less, what do you do? Do you offer compassion and consideration out into the world in recognition that all of this pining and whining after things you have no control over is somewhat absurd? Do you consider that every team in every sport goes through transitions and this team has offered almost nothing but quality and success for 6 years, and they deserve a bit of slack while the restructuring occurs? Or do you reflect that perhaps, above it all, you're too easily triggered by things that on the grand scale of life aren't that important, and that perhaps you should reflect on what you could do to stop flying off the handle so much or to reduce the feeling of impotent rage inside you? Do you accept personal responsibility for your own anger? Or do you simply allow yourself to be swept up by this indignant rage that you - a LIVERPOOL FAN - are being taken for a ride by these cheapskate, pieces of shit that won't spend as much as 'x' team, that have let the squad get to this 'state'? And who is in control of all this spending? I don't know! But who owns the club! FSG! FSG? Too amorphos! I need a man's face in my head, I need an external totem to blame all my feelings of insecurity and lack on! Who have we seen the most of - John Henry! It's his fault!! What an old, uncaring, piece of shit billionnaire he is. If only he left, then I could get all the things I want in life for Liverpool with any-other-billionaire in their stead. Because of course: gross over-simplification of the problem only works if you also grossly-oversimplify the solution.

Bill Shankly once said: if you can't support us when we lose, don't support us when we win. Or something like that. The idea being that supporting a club was about togetherness, unity - walking through a storm, you might say, together. There was an idea at Liverpool that you supported the team and the manager through everything, that yes you could be critical, but in a constructive way, and that ultimately you recognised that you were but a small, insignificant voice - but that if you had any power in the world as a Liverpool fan, it was the power to add your own positivity to that positive swell of the crowd that might drive the team on. 

Now, the modern fan feels like everything is an affront to them, personally. Their over-inflated egos have an expectation attached to their support: it's more like, if you can't win for me when I have taken the time to support you, don't even bother showing your face tomorrow because I will scream bloody-rage into it. Every loss is like a slap in their face. 

And so much of it is down to 'banter' culture too I feel; oh I shit all over United fans when they were doing poorly, which made me feel good about myself in comparison, but now that United fans are shitting on me and my team, it makes me feel like shit, and I don't even want to go into the office tomorrow because I can already see all the jackel faces just waiting to shit-grin in my face like I shit-grinned in theirs etc etc. So I must re-direct my anger at feeling like shit at someone -- so I'll redirect it at my own team! Or other simple targets, as mentioned. 

The thing I find most curious about it all is recognising that nobody abuses a club, its owners, its players or its managers now more than the people who claim to 'support' them. The single greatest potential the modern fan-base has is to be a toxic online presence that depresses everyone, and potentially threatens and alienates actually talented people from the club. In the past, the fans were those people most loyal, most willing to turn up and use their energy positively to try to affect positive change. Now, 90% of online fans are toxic, over-entitled know-it-alls whose key agenda seems to be to hone in on individual humans with the sole intent of spreading their own misery and lack of self-worth into their soul, almost as if it's all a game of reflection and deflection: I will love you and name my baby after you when you make me feel good; I will DM you to kill yourself when you make me feel bad. 

TL;DR: I should actually do some work today or I'm going to be fired. Oh, and people just like an easy answer to complex issues. And a single, human-shaped figure to blame is easier again than an amorphos corporation.",Liverpool,Yes,j719zv1,t1_j713xl9

"Tbh bringing Milner, Jones, Fabinho and Hendo on when you need a goal and not getting one is hardly surprising haha.

We defo looked better but we couldn't of really looked any worse. Brighton weren't at as full strength as they were in the league either tbh.

Think the forward 3 is massively important tomorrow. Klopp is getting the personel/positions wrong every game atm. Nunez has to play central tomorrow and Gakpo has to play on the left. They've played 90%+ of their careers like that why's Klopp changing it?",Liverpool,Yes,j71dhvu,t1_j718b8v

Yeah i thought this too. straight after the game i was deeply irritated by losing at the last minute but in hindsight we were fine the first half, arguably much better in the second half and the wheels only really came off after Hendo, Fab and CuJo were subbed on.

The subs were disastrous though...those three coming on don't look like a team trying to win, rather trying to hold out for a draw.

It was probably negligence to not bring a new midfielder in, but we're now in a position where Keita and Ox are likely gone, Milner may go, Fabinho looks like a shell of himself and Henderson will get further reduced minutes.

Robbo flys out to press all they way to LW and there‚Äôs no one backing him up, our LCM is non existent and Madrid play round us like it‚Äôs a training match.

"Robbo has been poor for 3 seasons. He was poor in 20-21 season but everyone was poor and we had many injuries so it wasn‚Äôt discussed much. Last season he was poor as well and struggled in those games in which we dropped points in the first half of the season. There were quite a few shouts of Tsimikas starting consistently. He had a few good games in the second half of the season and it was forgotten.

He has been the beneficiary of not being the biggest issue in the squad right now. His braindead pressing leaves our defence constantly exposed. And has made many stupid tackles giving away free kicks in dangerous areas. His issues maybe because there‚Äôs no Mane who a smart presser and didn‚Äôt allow much from his side. He also had Wijnaldum, one of the smartest players at blocking spaces and his Van Dijk was his centre back partner.

"Palhinha is 28 and Anguissa is 27, we should be going for 20-25 year olds",Liverpool,Yes,j7437z8,t1_j73ymdd

"No spending 600+ million in half a season is absolute mental and something should be done about it

Very few clubs could ever spend that much and it‚Äôs not healthy for the market at all and look what happened last time he commented on a clubs spending",Liverpool,Yes,j71kb6h,t1_j71imv3
This is the right context.,Liverpool,Yes,j70tkm0,t1_j70qssy
They spent half a billion on players. There will be expectations. Don't be silly.,Liverpool,Yes,j74d9hn,t1_j7464pu
The not his team argument doesn‚Äôt work at all as they‚Äôre signing the best talents in the world,Liverpool,Yes,j74dy83,t1_j7464pu
Probably right. But I think it's one of those situations where it's so brutally obvious that Fab's form is gone that he figured there's no use in papering over it. A plummet in form this extreme probably hasn't happened in his tenure. I appreciate the candor.,Liverpool,Yes,j72gumg,t1_j71lama
"There should be a post on the sub. Basically he said how Fabinho is not in good form and that it's good we have Bajcetic. Gave us an injury update , jota back in full training next week, VVD and Bobby back soon",Liverpool,Yes,j71m534,t1_j71lwvd

Yep. Scored so many opening goals last season or goals to get us back into games. I just hope he can stay fit when he comes back because he‚Äôs missed parts of the last two seasons now,Liverpool,Yes,j733do7,t1_j7335ya
"True but Cucurella, Koulibaly and Sterling have all been shit and they had a pre season to get settled. Also Chelsea‚Äôs track record with signings is terrible so I really wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if majority of them flopped.",Liverpool,Yes,j73thii,t1_j73sv3d

With Enzo I too am in two minds. Loved him at the WC but it's gonna be an eyesore watching him play for Chelsea,Liverpool,Yes,j72syfe,t1_j72og10
"Does out of form extend to our pressing being poor? Just looks like the players are fucked. Like against Brighton in the league it was genuinely 2 passes and they were into our defence. 

I also don‚Äôt think the high line is doing us any favour, Chelsea were just pinging them over the top and winning second balls",Liverpool,Yes,j712odl,t1_j70ymy8
"I think it absolutely can be down to a single person, considering he's very close to Klopp. Highly doubt Klopp would let the club just fire him. 

Lots of pieces by reputable journalists have been done on the brilliance of Edwards and our stats department, and how they deserve a fair share of credit when it comes to signing players who turn out highly successful. You don't just have a long list of great transfers over several years by throwing darts at a board.",Liverpool,Yes,j734k36,t1_j72q36u
Potter is getting fired before that,Liverpool,Yes,j73x9cx,t1_j73wgn1
"Chelsea players have everything but a long time to gel, ironically.

"Chelsea have absolutely gambled everything on these massive contracts. If it works, great, but if it doesn't, they could end up in a Barca-level mess in the long term.",Liverpool,Yes,j73ytgr,t1_j73yio6
"""I don't want to scapegoat him based on zero evidence apart from speculative journo articles, but I think he's the reason for our problems and should leave"". 

Fans always think they've diagnosed the issues. I don't think Pep is particularly likeable personally but I'd imagine the club being a mess top to bottom based on that brain drain Reddy article is more the issue than Pep, and something that the owners don't care about and new owners would presumably try and remedy.",Liverpool,Yes,j75k7ml,t1_j73ky6l
"Lack of transfers + fatigue from last years quadruple run. It's not talked about as much as it should. 4 trophy runs right to the end, only to win two domestic cups is excruciating for the players, but the drop off in performance has been noticeable since last season. The players have absolutely been ran into the ground and losing the UCL final and prem title has had a huge effect on that.",Liverpool,Yes,j716j3v,t1_j714ry1

"My God the sheer level of Robbo slander here that's completely unsubstantiated by stats or the eye test. Apparently Robbo has been rubbish for 3 years, including a year ago when he was hands down the best LB in the world. How is this shite upvoted",Liverpool,Yes,j72k3ig,t1_j717osc
Agreed. Personally I wouldn't be against Kostas starting a few consecutive games. We can't really judge him if he starts one game every month or so. No one should feel like he is untouchable,Liverpool,Yes,j717uxf,t1_j717osc
Why painful‚Ä¶no threat to us. Nice little vanilla team,Liverpool,Yes,j73tvot,t1_j73t9ft

"No it wasn‚Äôt, we just read things from different places and trust different sources. Every single football club in the world has leaks and people talking. There‚Äôs always been whisperings about things from inside Liverpool and some accounts pick it up (especially on twitter) and some don‚Äôt. People also need to use their brains and add 1+2 together.. some things are *so* obvious.. Edwards left bc he wanted a break? Really, *just* that üò≠I‚Äôm glad these discussions happen elsewhere. No one is bigger then the club on twitter so fans are more open to conversation. People actually critique Klopp and use sense on there.",Liverpool,Yes,j71rdnt,t1_j71qog1
It‚Äôs clearly not just on about Kornmayer we‚Äôve had plenty saying Klopp and Pep have had more of a say in transfers,Liverpool,Yes,j71q4jq,t1_j71pst5
">. What ACTUAL evidence is there that he has ‚Äútoo much power‚Äù?

There is a few articles from reliable jouro's saying that him and Klopp have been given more power in terms of transfers, this can be backed up by the fact that months ago one of the big Dutch journo's reported saying that Pep see's Gakpo as the ""missing piece to Liverpool"" and then months later we sign him without there being any known interest before.

Klopp also clearly has certain players in mind for his midfield rebuild like Bellingham, Caicedo and they probably wanted Enzo as well before he went to Chelsea if Bellingham fell through and that is a big reason for us not going for anyone this window.",Liverpool,Yes,j725tzo,t1_j71s64m
"> What ACTUAL evidence is there that he has ‚Äútoo much power‚Äù?

Well, the Melissa Reddy article that just came out for one; and The Athletic article that came out a few months back. It's not just Lijnders of course though, it's the coaching staff as a whole who seem to have gained too much power.",Liverpool,Yes,j71t6vy,t1_j71s64m
True. It just hurts seeing a player of such quality going to a rival. I think it hurts because Reddy came out with that report last year that we will be monitoring him. What could have been‚Ä¶,Liverpool,Yes,j73l7nw,t1_j73kxjb
I think he works well as a double pivot no.6. I see him as a more athletic version of Thiago but still raw,Liverpool,Yes,j73kdld,t1_j73k5bh
"I hear that but he‚Äôs still very young so he can develop the other parts of his game, pretty much all youngsters lack physicality. He definitely has the talent to be a top player",Liverpool,Yes,j7330bj,t1_j732hmh
(Hopefully both),Liverpool,Yes,j71he9h,t1_j71g8kx
klopp is the reincarnation of jesus according to this sub mate.,Liverpool,Yes,j769s0r,t1_j75a1j5
honestly if that‚Äôs the case then firmino shouldn‚Äôt get an extension,Liverpool,Yes,j74er7i,t1_j74e82c
">Klopp has decided the best role for Gakpo is as a Bobby replacement

Thats why he's saying question the whole idea of Gakpo as false 9 because frankly buying a new winger and playing him as a false 9 when he has never played as one and he hasnt even settled in the new club, is just strange.",Liverpool,Yes,j75aa1a,t1_j74e82c

"He probably wouldn't have gotten injured in that game if we weren't so wasteful in front of goal as well. We had the chances to kill that game but didn't, meaning we had to fight to the final whistle instead of being able to control the game slowly. That's a side effect of our shit finishing that most don't consider - it means the rest of the team have to up their game more than they should have to.",Liverpool,Yes,j726u6d,t1_j723f2f
It wasn‚Äôt because he played those minutes his injury was cause by impact he got caught late and that‚Äôs what cause it,Liverpool,Yes,j72ah0x,t1_j723f2f
Extending Milner if the price is right is a no-brainer. Paying him his current wage on an extension would be insane.,Liverpool,Yes,j72vipx,t1_j71gdpf

"Hmm hard to say, there's definitely a certain era where it feels like Arsenal were neck and neck with United, and that went beyond just the invincibles season. Keane vs Viera, Pizzagate etc.

Obviously United won more titles but I don't think people look back on that specific era as total United domination. Wenger is still mentioned in similar breaths to Ferguson to this day.",Liverpool,Yes,j745zwi,t1_j7448oo
I think he is exceptional but not world class. The term gets used too much.,Liverpool,Yes,j712wnk,t1_j710pt8
"He's not even close, he's exceptional, and our best midfielder but world class gets used too much. 

Stevie was was world class, Xabi Alonso was world class, KDB is world class. Unfortunately we don't have any world class Midfielders at the moment.

He literally works in KFC,Liverpool,Yes,j713msk,t1_j70vly7
"Who is actually having a good season for us? Alisson, Thiago, Firmino and maybe Nunez, but that's it. So even Trent being inconsistent is a vast improvement on most of our players(who have been shit) and has an argument for being our 5th best player this season.",Liverpool,Yes,j70z4er,t1_j70x7hn

"Trusting random unsourced twitter rumours because it seems likely is not smart mate. 

This is why twitter is full of morons spouting endless bullshit. 90% of the time they‚Äôre wrong.

"Nobody in the PL looked at him, it is what it is. 

The irony is, if we had signed him last summer, the conventional wisdom would have been that Spurs did better than us by signing Bissouma. 

Also, he has played 20 games in Portugal and 45 minutes in the Premier League...we don't yet know what type of career he will have",Liverpool,Yes,j73lu5q,t1_j73l7nw
"He's 19 already and never really even trained with the first team, can't see him making it here.

Look at Doak he's only been here like 6 months to a year and is only 16/17 and he's getting minutes for the first team.",Liverpool,Yes,j738pki,t1_j7330bj
does it matter if it works? The Benfica game he scored against us in CL he played on the wings also lol. In modern football position is meaningless anyway since you have players switching all the time. Salah starts on the wings but you see him more Central (at least till last season) for example,Liverpool,Yes,j74efj6,t1_j74e23d

Yeah he‚Äôs a very good player. 20m looks a snip now,Liverpool,Yes,j73s3v1,t1_j73ry5h

"Was Xabi any better than Thiago has been for us? He was exceptional in his final year but I'd say no more or less effective than Thiago has been.

I think people sometimes confuse his Real Madrid and Bayern form with ours, he was quite a raw player for us still early on, and only really came into his own just before he moved on.

If we are counting him as World Class then I would 100% say Thiago belongs in that bracket too.",Liverpool,Yes,j713uuv,t1_j712tbc

"Which part isn't true? Have you been watching Gomez this season? He's painfully shit at CB nowadays, and no it's not even because of our midfield. He makes errors in the basics and doesn't learn from them.",Liverpool,Yes,j715cob,t1_j7158if

We got murdered on transition and gave away a lot of chances when he came on so yeah probably not as we were winning the ball higher up the pitch with the starting midfield on the pitch . Playing with fab is like being down to 10 men,Liverpool,Yes,j72fk72,t1_j72ae9f
"I'll be honest barring a handful of games I think he's been very poor since Afcon. Might be tactics or whatever but he's been completely ineffective in most games, nullified by most defences I've seen him come up against, some of which are bang average. 

People have blamed it on a lack of service but even when he gets the ball he looks lost, constantly wayward passes, dribbles into trouble which go nowhere and awful touches by his standard. He literally doesn't look capable of beating a man anymore.",Liverpool,Yes,j714c9o,t1_j713f9z

When kept 2 clean sheets in a row vs Chelsea and Wolves. I thought he and Konat√© were our best players in those matches.,Liverpool,Yes,j71fs21,t1_j71f1t9
yeah so Jota might be a better companion for Nunez as both  can play wing and CF.  Its hard to tell what position Gakpo is going to play long term as we just dont have options rn but when everyone is back i think he's competing against Diaz on lw primarily.

He is.

I don't necessarily think VDB should replace him per say, but I'd rather see him on the pitch than Gomez atm

> Gomez has had some absolute stinkers this season, he's also had games where he was among our best players.

"I think Thiago is heavily reliant on the players around him being semi decent footballers, he‚Äôs not a one man show at all. He‚Äôs a technician, pass move, exchanges, small burst of pace, clever interceptions. But he‚Äôs not a guy who can dominate a midfield area on his own ‚Äî that‚Äôs never been his game.

I think if we put a world class 8 like Bellingham next to Thiago you would see world class performances, but he‚Äôs playing next to the likes of Henderson and we haven‚Äôt see any world class midfield performances since the end of 20/21 season when Hendo was injured.",Liverpool,Yes,j71ez6q,t1_j71edkk
"Link one article that says the club can't employ doctors because of Kornmayer's techniques. Just one. 

I find this current witchhunt very insidious, to be honest.

Thankfully, users on r/Liverpoolfc have cracked the enigma code and realised one man is the issue and have this whole heap of proof.

"The departure of club doctor Jim Moxon came as a surprise last summer, with Reddy adding that his exit came as a result of ‚Äúgrowing friction within the medical sphere between the physiotherapists and sports scientists.""

Philipp Jacobsen, the clubs former head of performance who left in 2020, is said to have found it ‚Äúnear impossible‚Äù to organise the club‚Äôs medical department.

And intriguingly, Reddy singles out Liverpool‚Äôs head of fitness and conditioning Andreas Kornmayer as an individual who ‚Äúwields too much influence and is hard to work with.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is a lot of focus on not refreshing the playing squad enough, which is correct but it is true behind the scenes too.

‚ÄúA lot of key people have left, some have gained too much power. There‚Äôs less faith in the decisions now.‚Äù


There you go..

Buvac and Achterberg were both pure speculation among people here. This is from reputable journalists and former employees. 

>continue to employ a man hellbent on injuring every single one of our players with destructive regimes

Stop being thick. No one said he's doing that, just that his decisions go against what club doctors support and as a result, our players are very frequently injured.",Liverpool,Yes,j743hvj,t1_j73zfe9
"I‚Äôm just asking for an explanation as to why the first goal we conceded from a set piece was fine but the second goal conceded from a set piece was because of Fabinho?

Have you seen the amount of goals we‚Äôve conceded from set pieces this season? 

That‚Äôs a major major major problem for us irrespective of anyones individual performances.

Honestly for me, I think our midfield has been shite with whoever has lined up in it for the majority of this season AND last season. People forget that we were 17 points behind city in the second half of last season too, that‚Äôs one more point than we are now.

"Ah, so the article, despite being fairly damning, does not mention your original argument (that the club cannot get medical teams to work with Kornmayer) at all. It mentions he's difficult to work with and ""wields too much influence"", which is incredibly vague considering we aren't made aware what this influence entails. 

Basically, you've read one article that mentions his name and demonised him as a result, much in the same way people have demonised Ljinders over the last month or so because he released a book and he too  apparently has too much ""influence"" behind the scenes. 

Rather than accept our issues (poor form, injuries, lack of tactical awareness) are down to a series of events and multiple people, you all attempt to blame it on one person as though one person being sacked would suddenly have us playing brilliantly again. It's a specialised form of naivety.",Liverpool,Yes,j744a2k,t1_j743hvj
"We weren‚Äôt 17 points behind 
We were at worst 14 but we had two games in hand 
So it was 8 if we won our games in hand 
We went 6 behind losing to leicester then it became 8 when we drew with Chelsea then for some reason they were two match days ahead of us until like Leeds toward the end of the run in 
Our midfield is fine when we have one of Thiago or keita. 
Problem is none of our other midfielders can handle being pressed so play hoof the grenade because they panic. 
The three we‚Äôve been playing recently was a massive improvement on fab and hendo. 
They can run to start with. 
When was the last time Henderson or fab won a tackle ? I can‚Äôt think of it",Liverpool,Yes,j72ldnc,t1_j72kivq
"I disagree. He's way clear of Xabi in terms of ball winning ability, more mobile and has a comparable ability to dictate the tempo. Out of all our midfielders right now he wins the most tackles, gets the most interceptions, he's no lightweight.

"Anyway, midfield is crap. 2 goals from set pieces, 1 without fab on the pitch, 1 with fab on the pitch. I don‚Äôt think he was the determining factor as to why we lost",Liverpool,Yes,j72lr56,t1_j72ldnc
"Not comparing him to our non existent current midfield though. But fair enough if you would take Thiago over Alonso it‚Äôs not a crazy shout. But even so, I think Thiago‚Äôs had 1 world class spell with us at the end of 20/21 season. Otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt say we have had any world class midfield performances. I can‚Äôt remember a single one",Liverpool,Yes,j73g4ek,t1_j731ctz
"Considering I'm a uni lecturer, I'd like to think my reading comprehension is fairly decent, mate - but good attempt at derailing a failing argument and descending into personal insults. 

Your argument was ""the club cannot get doctors because of Kornmayer"". Whilst the article is pretty vociferous in its treatment of him, it never mentions the club struggling to get doctors in - just that people already within the club don't want to work with him. Your argument is an inflated one designed to make the users who are maybe less educated on the topic panic & immediately blame Kornmayer for our current funk. It isn't being a Top Red to point out that that's unnecessarily inflammatory and harmful to both this sub and the club in the long-run. 

I liken you to the LjindersOut brigade because both movements can't see the wood for the trees; you're blinded by your own irrational hatred of a person you've never met because Reddy told you to, and you've conflated a myriad of other, unconnected aspects, to the point where you genuinely think this is all the doing of one man. That's insanity. 

For the record, I despise FSG. They're now actively ruining this club.",Liverpool,Yes,j76232w,t1_j748eck
"Alonso also had the luxury of playing aside two other world-class players in midfield when he was putting in world-class performances for us. 

Fabinho one could argue was world-class at points, but the third member of the trio was at best, like Henderson or Keita at their best, very good but not world class. 

But yeah I think Thiago's ball-winning ability has always been great for us. He can be a bit reckless in the challenge but his reading of the game and physicality means he gets there more often than not, and was better than any other midfielder we had off the ball other than Fabinho when he was good and Henderson at his best, but both are specialist 6s. 

I think even compared to Gini he's a more intelligent defender, even though he's not as tenacious.",Liverpool,Yes,j73h190,t1_j73g4ek
"I guess we just disagree lol. I can understand your points, but I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm seeing when I watch him play for us. Say what you want about Gini but we got dominated in midfield by teams like Brentford last season and it‚Äôs continued this season. I‚Äôm by no means taking shots at Thiago; but I don‚Äôt think he can do it alone or is effective enough in our current set up to call his performances world class (aside from 20/21 season).",Liverpool,Yes,j73ncbe,t1_j73h190
"We might be thinking of the reverse fixture but with Brentford last season didn't they by pass our midfield and overload Trent aerially? 

> I‚Äôm by no means taking shots at Thiago; but I don‚Äôt think he can do it alone or is effective enough in our current set up to call his performances world class

I don't disagree with this, but I don't think this is due to lack of world-class ability. I think it's due to a lot of struggles we've had in midfield and elsewhere over his time at the club.",Liverpool,Yes,j73qwut,t1_j73ncbe
"Yeah that‚Äôs what I mean sorry, without Gini we got dominated by teams like Brentford. When we had him that didn‚Äôt happen. 

So my original point was that as a lone player (as Thiago essentially is at the moment because our midfield is so poor) I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs as effective as Alonso. I think in this current Liverpool side Alonso would have more of an impact in games, Thiago for me often goes missing.

We've done well with the prices we've got for some youth prospects, but Wijnaldum going for free was madness, as was Origi. Mane went for fucking pennies, Naby, Ox both bought in for big money (at the time) look as though they'll be gone for free soon. Firmino could go end of the season for nothing as well.

He has stagnated but he's still just 22 ffs. If the question is whether he should stay then the answer for me is a resounding yes.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wmmjj,t1_j6wi1yw
For me hes the type of player you keep around as long as hes happy being a squad player.

"Pep kept a lot of them on as well.

If Bobby's happy to be a 6th choice attacker, on a reduced wage, why wouldn't you keep him? He's still got a lot to contribute. We've got 4 attackers under the age of 26 and two over the age of 30. It's not like it's an aging part of the team.",Liverpool,Yes,j70ptlx,t1_j6wnt4t
"Klopp is too loyal to certain players I know he said he isn't but he clearly is, keeping Firmino is really just a sentimental thing because if you base giving him a contract on the last few years then there's no way he should be getting one.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wo2tv,t1_j6wnt4t

Yes, it's at home and they're utter shite, but they have Brexitball Dyche at the wheel, and he'll set up a nasty 4-4-2 bus that will be utterly difficult to break down.

Such an absolute mess.",Liverpool,Yes,j6y57ep,t1_j6xmud6
"This season Firmino has been good but he was below average for 2 seasons at least. What if he goes back to that form? I think the chances are high given how long his bad form lasted compared to the half a season where he has been good. Plus we need money to sign players. We also need to get younger players and plan for the future - it doesn‚Äôt matter if attack already has players for the future, we need slots for other areas like midfield. Considering all these factors I think we need to move on. We are making the same mistake we made giving Henderson a new contract. We have less money and less slots to get a new player primed for success at the right age.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wio2t,t1_j6wfmyn

"He is incredible as a 2nd half sub, why would anybody want him out?",Liverpool,Yes,j6wg1v5,t1_j6wfmyn

"When fit, which isn‚Äôt often of late, he won‚Äôt be starting, he takes up a squad space, he‚Äôll still be on decent money, considering his age etc yes it‚Äôs wiser to let him go. Keep him for what? To be a cheer leader? The I play a few games a season we can give minutes to some younger players. We don‚Äôt have many games left this season, won‚Äôt have too many next season with no europe, so there isn‚Äôt a valid reason to keep him",Liverpool,Yes,j6wz7hq,t1_j6wfmyn
We were genuinely good in 20/21. We had the best form in the League for the majority of the season. That middle part + VAR bullshit is what did us in. We could've shithoused a title with a bit more luck.,Liverpool,Yes,j6wetsj,t1_j6w6snc
"20/21 squad easily, not even a contest. Forget how the names look on paper, we actually controlled most of our games still. That was the season where teams low blocked the hell out of us and we found it difficult to break them down and keep clean sheets. This current team doesn‚Äôt look like it can dominate a game or out play any opponent to me, the attack and midfield is considerably worse.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wdvkn,t1_j6w6snc
"On paper this one all day, but in reality it feels like something is different this year, like the fight has genuinely gone from some of them.",Liverpool,Yes,j6w77vb,t1_j6w6snc

"Slim to none. He's an excellent player and I believe he could evolve into a playmaker coming off our right wing, if he was to lose pace, with TAA overlapping and supported by a BWM/BBM. Could possibly be phased out for Elliott after a few years.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wfs35,t1_j6wfez9
He won't leave. PSG are gonna go back to Ziyech who plays in the same position after missing out on him and we won't sell him to a PL rival. Reastically no one can afford him right now.,Liverpool,Yes,j6wg53d,t1_j6wfez9
"I don‚Äôt see him leaving and I don‚Äôt want to see him leaving.

He‚Äôs still putting up good numbers even in a dysfunctional team and I feel his form has been overblown slightly.

We saw what he can do when provided service before the world cup",Liverpool,Yes,j6wfqgt,t1_j6wfez9

"I wouldn't renew him either. But if we decided to keep him as a 6th choice attacker I wouldn't be overly bothered either. 

I will say though, people on here think he was in some unreal form before the WC but lets be honest 50% of his PL contributions came from 1 game. And his only contributions in the CL came in a hammering against a poor Rangers team. He had 1 goal in his last 9 games before his injury. 

The wrong side of 30, Becoming more injury prone and has declined massively over the last couple of years. Could still do a job but when players get unreliable we should cut ties. It's what's hindered us the last few years.",Liverpool,Yes,j6xk7oe,t1_j6x1l90
Our other attacking players aren‚Äôt fairing very well either. If Bobby can step back into a distributor role it‚Äôs a good move. His passing is as good as Thiago‚Äôs when he‚Äôs on form.,Liverpool,Yes,j6x7bb0,t1_j6x1l90

Well I‚Äôve found the problem in your theory",Liverpool,Yes,j6vyntb,t1_j6vxysb
"Wolves and especially Everton are must wins and really no excuse not to take all 6 points. I don't think anyone should be too surprised if we fail to beat the most defensively sound team this year in Newcastle given how there is no supply to the product in our final third.

In saying that we got a late winner against Newcastle earlier in the season, but at this point all I'm asking for is a convincing display against a side who we should be beating easily on paper. Our players need some confidence and belief again",Liverpool,Yes,j6vyn6r,t1_j6vxysb
That would be a cracking signing even if for a few months,Liverpool,Yes,j6w8kmc,t1_j6w8frc
We‚Äôre not cut throat enough to offload players like Fabinho,Liverpool,Yes,j6wzog0,t1_j6wzgzc
"I think we get:

Zieler (cheap)

Bellingham 

Matheus Nunes

Mason Mount (free)

Jo≈°ko Gvardiol

With 3 of these being sizable outlays.

Curtis Jones becomes a homegrown player next year I think? Ramsay/Carvalho/Elliott/Bellingham/Doak/Davies/Gordon/Bacjetic all still u-21 so don't need to be registered in 2023/24 PL squad

I agree that we would look to shift Fabinho though I suspect Klopp might take the same view as when we held on to Sturridge and Lovren - that yes we could get ¬£20-30m for him but he's probably better than the equivalent player we could buy on the open market for the same money

I'd hope we can sell him and get in another body for the strictly DM position.

Firmino I hope signs a new contract and stays. Milner I think this will finally be a season too far and should leave.

Adri√°n/Oxlade-Chamberlain/Ke√Øta/Phillips also to leave

Carvalho is an interesting one, I reckon he'd do well on loan to get experience. I'm not sure where he fits in, especially if we signed Mount.",Liverpool,Yes,j6x2t6r,t1_j6wzgzc
"I like everything you've said. Only thing I don't agree on is Milner. The only good thing he has going for him is his professionalism, Experience and being a leader. We have loads of players like that though. 

He's versatile but realistically isn't really good enough in any position now. I don't think we need to keep him and Henderson. And realistically we aren't gonna shift Hendo on.",Liverpool,Yes,j6x1js5,t1_j6wzgzc
"Bellingham
Ugarte
Nunes/caicedo
Keep fabinho and sell matip he wants to return to Germany aswell.

A homegrown gk would be fantastic.",Liverpool,Yes,j6xrz17,t1_j6wzgzc
"I think Milner staying is good for a year, Hendo can go, and I think being captain, if he left it would really help change this foolish loyalty culture. We'd need a new captain, let alone a replacement. Milner seems to execute as he's required to, more so than Hendo.

I'd prefer Kelleher to stay, but accept it's asking a bit much. All the others can go, along with Gomez. I think bellingham and Florian Wirtz or Sucic.

We'd need more, but I'm not sure who else, and who would be a reasonable price. Hopefully we could build with the above, plus Morton back in the fold.",Liverpool,Yes,j6x3zx2,t1_j6wzgzc
No chance we get Chiesa as a BACKUP for Salah! He‚Äôd be his replacement if anything.,Liverpool,Yes,j6wxmz4,t1_j6wvfft
I‚Äôd love him. But we‚Äôd need to let firmino and one other forward go. Can‚Äôt see it happening I‚Äôm afraid.,Liverpool,Yes,j6ww4f6,t1_j6wvfft
"I‚Äôd rather just get the midfield sorted we do need a long term Salah replacement but attack is the least of our issues at the moment

We need to prioritise midfield and defence he‚Äôd still likely cost around 50m so just not worth it",Liverpool,Yes,j6wxsfe,t1_j6wvfft
We signed the immovable midfielder Copium,Liverpool,Yes,j6xwnqe,t1_j6x6ltv

"4-2, narrow first leg and we capitulate in the 2nd leg",Liverpool,Yes,j6wf2lb,t1_j6wb4xr
"it's actually nothing like the Ox/Keita situation. Both were signed and given big contracts as first team, starting 11 type players. Due to their injuries they never quite hit the heights they should have, and as such, were impossible to sell, and so difficult to replace in the squad until their contracts ran down. Their presence impacted Liverpool's ability to bring in other first team midfielders. Re-signing James Milner, for instance, does none of these things, as his wages and squad position mean the club can still go out and bring in the midfielders they want, in theory, once Ox and Keita go.

Firmino has already been effectively replaced. He is an experienced, quality player who will be accepting a reduction in wages to remain as a bit part of a front 6 - so if he gets injured, or loses form, it doesn't affect the team's wider ability to perform, or affect the club's potential depth in the front line for the next few years.

Jorginho, same age, a DM with less mobilty and less commitment to Arsenal, was just signed for ¬£12m and was deemed a sensible transfer. Holding onto Bobby gives Liverpool options for how to play, while keeping one of the most committed and positive presences around the squad. And it ultimately won't affect their ability to sign new forwards - as is evidenced by the fact that Liverpool just signed another forward that they look to be attempting to mould into a similar position.",Liverpool,Yes,j6w65on,t1_j6vwgz7
Agreed. Won't get much love for it tho.,Liverpool,Yes,j6w3q71,t1_j6vwgz7
I agree as well. he doesn't have the legs to lead the line anymore.,Liverpool,Yes,j6w697o,t1_j6vwgz7

Cos Mane has pulled up trees at Bayern. All our players are suffering from last season and getting injuries. Mane had an injury as well. Salah is in a team that barely gets the ball forward quickly anymore. Also he‚Äôs off form and confidence is low throughout the team. Class is permanent as they say.,Liverpool,Yes,j6w6be6,t1_j6w5zty
"Mane hasn't been the better player since 2020, he had a awful 20/21 season and then he was average for most of 21/22 until the last few months where he went on a scoring run

Getting rid of Mane was the right decision, we miss the 2020 Mane not the current one who is half the player. Our attack is only a problem because we have Diaz and Jota out, and Nunez the big money signing hasn't had a instant impact.",Liverpool,Yes,j6w6gjr,t1_j6w5zty
"Man√©‚Äôs been injured 

Salah has not

Salah > Man√©",Liverpool,Yes,j6w6qvg,t1_j6w5zty
"For the 900th time MANE ASKED TO LEAVE, we didn‚Äôt just flog him off.

The choice to keep him against his will after everything he‚Äôs done for this club would have been fucking shitty.

"How many times are we gonna bring up this argument ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Mane left because he wanted a change, he had informed Klopp in summer of 2021 that he wanted to leave after 21/22 season. Salah wanted to stay and Mane wanted to leave, that‚Äôs why Salah was offered a new contract. It‚Äôs really simple to understand.",Liverpool,Yes,j6w6gdg,t1_j6w5zty
Lol really nailed it with the ‚Äúunpopular opinion‚Äù haha,Liverpool,Yes,j6wcndt,t1_j6w5zty

"They've got quite a lot right, he was the first person that talked about the Arthur loan and Gakpo transfer.

There's other stuff I can't remember off the top of my head but he does seem to have some sort of inside knowledge",Liverpool,Yes,j6xeh1p,t1_j6xdc9r
Kante is too old and Gallagher isn't good enough imo. Kovacic and Mount would be good signings.,Liverpool,Yes,j6x4ekx,t1_j6x3bvs
Why are so many of our fans keen for us to sign Gallagher. He's not a good enough player.,Liverpool,Yes,j6x3rvt,t1_j6x3bvs

"Atleast his wife didn't crying about him losing the election, unlike someone else's wife",Liverpool,Yes,j6ym12y,t1_j6yklig
"Was.

He didn't support him at the last election (although Fabinho did). From Brazilian friends, apparently Bolsonaro's behaviour during the whole pandemic was shocking and turned a lot of people off him, especially doctors who'd voted for him.

"I think he is/was a Bolsonaro supporter who is quite controversial.

To be honest we don't know these people so I try to avoid knowing much more than what they do on the pitch.",Liverpool,Yes,j6yjba8,t1_j6yb604

"Utd fan here.  We don't want him back.  Have a look at  the reddevils sub.  I didn't see anyone supporting his return.  He's scum regardless.  We're supposed to have a ""no dickheads"" policy now - time to test it out.  I agree with everything you say, save for the bit about ETH.  Finally we seem to have someone with a pair of balls.  Lets hope Greenwood fucks off to somewhere far away.    Take care cousin!",Liverpool,Yes,j6y1207,t1_j6x8tih

"The thing is, they could have made a profit while still investing. Do they think the owners of city don‚Äôt make a profit? Or Newcastle or literally every other club in the league who have had more transfer activity this window than us? But they refuse because they want every last drop for themselves.",Liverpool,Yes,j6w4ura,t1_j6w4rw4
"and yet for years people have insisted how superior they were to the Glazers who were just using the club for money. without Klopp and Barcelona being reckless with their spending a few years back, we'd be a top 4 side at best and FSG would have been satisfied with that",Liverpool,Yes,j6w58b2,t1_j6w4rw4
"Why on Earth would you buy a business if not to profit? I get that people see football as different, but it's not. If I buy a distressed business and put in the time and effort to make it better and generate money, of course that money is mine when I sell!",Liverpool,Yes,j70pckh,t1_j6w4rw4
"Exactly this. They may not take dividends, but that doesn't make them much better than other American owners; what they do is choke off cashflow available to the manager for on-field success in favour of paying down debt used for hard/infrastructure assets, which directly increases projected revenue and asset valuation. Is that also good for the club - yes, of course, a new stand is important, as are new facilities etc. But there's a point at which single-minded fixed asset investment is counterproductive - there's no point in having 100,000 seats if the football is dire and the squad is knackered and you're sat in 10th. It's a balancing act and they've gotten it badly wrong, like an obese man doing a man on a wire thing. The last straw really has been this winter window, where they're not even allowing the manager to spend club cash flow + a tiny amount for net spend in the middle of a bonafide midfield crisis - because they only look at player purchases as an overvalued/undervalued asset with resale value (which is why they'd approve a Gakpo purchase but not a Caicedo).",Liverpool,Yes,j6w4725,t1_j6w1x8c
"So sad that so many people don‚Äôt see it. We should be out there protesting and flags in Anfield every week, but so many people are happy to let it go. Look at Leicester, their chairman just announced that they‚Äôve, essentially, cleared their debts from the club to them. The way FSG treat us is a joke.",Liverpool,Yes,j6w2fhs,t1_j6w1x8c
I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs taken so long for so many people to realise. The sooner they‚Äôre gone the better,Liverpool,Yes,j6w1t07,t1_j6w19rb
It was mentioned in Lynch's article that after the Gakpo deal we prioritised debt repayment. I don't think it was mentioned where he got that information from though.,Liverpool,Yes,j6wb4sb,t1_j6w9b2r

"We lost 530m in Covid? The season after we won the UCL? The season we won the league? Yet no other club seems to have suffered as badly? It‚Äôs a joke that you swallow these lines they feed you, telling you that they just don‚Äôt have any money",Liverpool,Yes,j70tlko,t1_j70p71p
"I don't think missing out on Europe would really help us that much to be honest. We've often looked our most underwhelming when we've got no midweek football, like all of the momentum gets sucked out of us.",Liverpool,Yes,j6vx46j,t1_j6vvh44
"I‚Äôm not 100% sure if they‚Äôre going to leave, no one is‚Ä¶. 

Do I think it‚Äôll be a full sale rather than a partial one? Yes I do, with them being interested in the clearing of debts / interest in melwood again. 

Also, I‚Äôm wording it more as a full sale due to bias as that‚Äôs what I want. I simply can not wait to fuck these yanks off. We‚Äôre going to feel the lack of investment for the next couple years",Liverpool,Yes,j6wsm37,t1_j6ws9me

"Elliott will be fine as Klopp clearly rates him highly to try shoehorn him into the starting 11. Carvalho is what worries me, he got 18 g/a in the championship as a 10 and has yet to play as one since joining us. He‚Äôs contributed a few goals on the wing but ultimately doesn‚Äôt have the physical ability to do so and Klopp has put him in the basement",Liverpool,Yes,j6wtdj9,t1_j6wlp62
">You can tell from the first game. Every single person knows it, when someone just has it.

Are we forgetting how much everyone was raving about him in the 20/21 season? he was one of the few bright spots of that season, he has barely even played in the last two due to an eye injury he kept having.

I don't think he'll ever be good enough to be a consistent starter but I don't see how we can't be good enough to be at least a squad player.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wn51m,t1_j6wlqhv
That's not my point,Liverpool,Yes,j6xz2mr,t1_j6xyzlb
"Well getting so close then realizing there was no help coming and all the same players now a year older would be expected to just do better in order to win anything.

"He was our top scorer in the first part of the league, no? 

Just checked, he's been injured since the WC and is still joint top PL scorer. If that's not him playing well before the WC break, I don't know what is.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wradj,t1_j6wmsyl
"I would love to see that but as you say it probably won‚Äôt happen. That with Thiago and Keita/Bajcetic behind would be pretty effective I imagine. Well, it wouldn‚Äôt be worse than what we‚Äôve done so far this season",Liverpool,Yes,j6xdhdx,t1_j6xd53h
This makes too much sense to actually happen. Subbing in Keita for Bajcetic and Elliott for Salah at 60‚Äô would also make too much sense.,Liverpool,Yes,j6y3ery,t1_j6xd53h

"They were all starting in premier league winning squads when they left.

"Age is irrelevant their impact on the team was still pretty good by the time they left (not aguero as he was basically injured his whole last season) and they were still older than him so that‚Äôs not what I mean. 

Pep basically gives his players a year after they start to drop off then sell them, we fall into the same trap time and time again Firmino should‚Äôve been replaced last summer he was basically unused last season with a few injuries making him miss about half of our premier league games. Then this season he has a couple of good games then is out for like 3 months and people want to renew. It‚Äôs only going to get worse.",Liverpool,Yes,j711yd5,t1_j70ptlx
"It had actually already dried up to be honest he started every game since city to Southampton 6 games only scoring one then went out injured since mid November.

"yeah if like FIFA or FM had some ""situation"" scenario where you takeover at real-life moments, and you had to pick one team to get us out of the holes we were in, I'd pick 22/23's team in a heartbeat

but in reality, 20/21 pulled off things this season's team could only dream of. 8W 2D 0L from the final 10, including away trips at Molineux, the Emirates, Old Trafford, the Hawthorns and Turf Moor? Shieeet, this season's team couldn't even dream of a mentality like that",Liverpool,Yes,j6wdqur,t1_j6w77vb

"tbh im the same in that im finding myself not wanting to watch our games, and its precisely *because* I care about the club lol

If I didn't care about the club or only in a minor way, I'd have no problem watching our midfield get outrun and outgunned by everyone and conceding within the first 10 mins like clockwork

I didn't get a chance to go see us at Anfield this season, and I've seen us live once in August; my not watching will have no tangible effect on the team, and will save me a tonne of anxiety and stress",Liverpool,Yes,j6wf22n,t1_j6we941
It does seem to have become more accepted now to stop watching when we‚Äôre shit which is mad to me because that just seems like textbook fair weather support. Like the definition of plastic.

"The issue we have is Kelleher, Phillips and Ox are all homegrown so letting go of Milner would be 4 homegrown players gone in one go which is too much. Bringing in Zieler makes up for Kelleher but we still need another two after that.",Liverpool,Yes,j6x2f7y,t1_j6x1js5
"I'd also rather Milner stay over Hendo but don't think that'll happen.

I think the club would rather keep Kelleher as well but from what I've seen it's him that wants to leave to get more game time.",Liverpool,Yes,j6xat0h,t1_j6x3zx2

Yeah but the thought is that he asked to leave BECAUSE of the long drawn out Mo Salah contract show. Everyone talking about how important Mo is and Mane feeling like he‚Äôs not getting equal recognition. You‚Äôve also gotta imagine now that Mo is earning double anyone else in the team thats gotta leave a bad taste in everyone elses mouth. Especially when he‚Äôs been as shit as anyone this season.,Liverpool,Yes,j6wcyu4,t1_j6w9eha
People seem to forget how much rumbling was occurring before the UCL final due to Mane. Or how it came out after his move he actually wanted to leave in 2021. May I forget that he himself said he thinks Senegalese people want him to move away from LFC,Liverpool,Yes,j6w8lo1,t1_j6w6gdg

"They're selling, which is what people want them to do. It's ridiculous to think they're going to put in new windows when they're selling the house. I think they should sell too, but I'm not deluded enough to think they're going to spend whilst that's happening.",Liverpool,Yes,j70pgkj,t1_j6w4725

"Correct; Klopp's method really needs rhythm to work, and that rhythm only really comes from playing every 3/4 days. There was a very interesting comment from Guardiola once about whether he appreciates the very rare week rests in the PL and he said no, he'd much rather have his team play every 3 days otherwise they lose the head of steam they've built up.",Liverpool,Yes,j6vxrb9,t1_j6vx46j

He doesn‚Äôt change the things he does wrong (slow passes, not releasing the ball). Look at other teams squad players, look at who they bring of the bench?!

"Very good point. Midfield should be the priority. Ndicka on a free would be a fantastic move, but idk how much competition there will be and how big his wages will be.

He was getting goals in the first half of the season sure but his general performances really weren't that good and he was never seen as a goalscorer so I think its more just a small purple goalscoring patch than anything,Liverpool,Yes,j6wrpch,t1_j6wradj

Idk football just doesn‚Äôt make me anxious. It‚Äôs a entertainment at the end of the day and it‚Äôs not impacting any of our lives. However it‚Äôs not supporting a club if you only rock up if we‚Äôre winning. The owners being cunts have no bearing on anyone‚Äôs supporting of the club and the people continually saying they‚Äôll be back when we‚Äôre winning again won‚Äôt be missed.

Like I said if we didn't have Hendo who also is no way near good enough I wouldn't mind but I just think It's time we get a bit more ruthless and less sentimental. 

I'd rather just go for another homegrown player. But I get it might be more difficult doing that. Just shows how much it's messed us up hanging onto all these players for so long.",Liverpool,Yes,j6x780a,t1_j6x2f7y

We had Diaz and Man√© at the same time though right? I don‚Äôt think we signed Diaz because Man√© was leaving. And also neither of them are really the same type of player other than position,Liverpool,Yes,j6wpov1,t1_j6wk90b

"Taking a pay out instead of getting justice is basically saying rape is ok for the right price.

"This isn't about their conduct now - it's about their lack of spending since 2019, when they categorically were not selling. And no, if you were an owner who cared about the club and also just a good businessman who wanted to give the CL places a good go, the payoff from buying a midfielder or two, either in the summer or winter, to secure CL revenue would make it a worthwhile investment. At this point their miserliness is actually bad business as well, because it'll affect valuation. The house analogy doesn't hold up when there's a binary CL/no CL event hinging on spending a bit.",Liverpool,Yes,j70r1xf,t1_j70pgkj

">What does he bring right now? He‚Äôs living of a couple goals.

Mate he barely gets any minutes to even judge what he brings now, he's another player like Elliott that seems to get scapegoated for whatever reason.

You‚Äôre meant to say that when there‚Äôs a joke,Liverpool,Yes,j6wcf6n,t1_j6waxdd
">It‚Äôs a entertainment at the end of the day

That's the thing - it isn't entertaining. I wouldn't care about us being shit but playing with heart and energy, its probably what 90% of football fans in England go through anyway seeing as most don't support top 6 PL clubs, but every single club's fans would be (rightly) fuming, and crucially *not* entertained by players putting in barely any effort.

I've seen my local team live as much as I've seen Liverpool, and they've only been in the top flight 8 seasons since I was born - it's fine, because they put in a shift. 

Can you honestly say many games this season have actually been entertaining from a partisan LFC POV lol. Fewer than 10 at the halfway point of the season most likely

Shankly's line is about support. I'll never not support Liverpool, and any game I see them live I'll be as loud as humanly possible. But for games when its just on TV and I'm at home? Doesn't really factor into Shankly's line",Liverpool,Yes,j6wnqvh,t1_j6wigll
What are the reasons for it though?,Liverpool,Yes,j6wocku,t1_j6wo8o2
"He must have read a random link somewhere that morning and latched onto it with a gif that no-one would have tied to Arthur Melo so if it didn‚Äôt happen, people would be none the wiser. It follows his pattern of only speaking about something after someone else reports it first. 

This second theory‚Äôs a bit more far-fetched but maybe it was pure coincidence. It is a fairly common gif.

He‚Äôs said nothing of note other than that.",Liverpool,Yes,j6yjaup,t1_j6yi6n1
"> 38 year old a new contract on around 100k a week

I think he took a paycut in his last extension and probably would again if he was to another year.",Liverpool,Yes,j6xam51,t1_j6x780a
Yeah that was a dick move.,Liverpool,Yes,j6wd81k,t1_j6w8rl0
"> And also neither of them are really the same type of player other than position

We also have Jota then, who was signed because his stats were identical to Mane's. Also you could consider that the club wants to move in a different direction tactically.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wql0i,t1_j6wpov1
What do you mean we have enough depth? Half our squad‚Äôs in the hospital. We could give him a contract until the end of the season.,Liverpool,Yes,j6z1tw2,t1_j6z1ifs
"An abuse victim is not just as bad as her abuser because she opted not to go to a highly public trial, testify against him, have her whole personal history exploited by high-powered defense attorneys, have it all splashed all over the media, subject herself to vicious attacks online, and possibly decided to accept money for her apparently working class family.

This girl would have gone through absolute fucking hell in testifying.

To say nothing of the psychological elements of abusive relationships, considering the rumors that they're back together, and the fact that her FATHER was supporting Greenwood and pressuring her to shut up about it. This isn't on her.

Deciding not to press charges is the fault of everyone *except* this girl. Greenwood, the court system, the media, her family. But not her.",Liverpool,Yes,j6yhat7,t1_j6yfra3

"I remember fans burning his kits on YouTube. I stayed late that day hoping all the rumors are fake, but when I saw him with Chelsea kit I was devastated‚Ä¶ but over time I forgave him. He is still one of my favorite players of all time. I remember trying to copy his style, putting white socks over my red ones. Amazing days!",Liverpool,Yes,j6zi8w0,t1_j6zhr3e
">He's genuinely Wijnaldum 2.0, he has really good ball retention and physicality but there is an issue when it comes to progressing the ball.

I don't think you know Piers if you think how he is as an Arsenal fan even registers among the top 5 reasons he's a twat.,Liverpool,Yes,j6xzuu2,t1_j6xzel2
"We could just keep him for another season.I seriously doubt that he holds enough value that selling him would be worth it. He will be 32 in august and is injury prone. Clubs interested in him would probably just rather take him in a year for free?

He also knows the team/tactics, has experience, was usually always quite good. Hard to judge all our players on this absolute crap season. 

Would rather just sign a new CB for the future and have him still on board. Helps to bed in the new guys and we still have additional cover. I would rather sell Joe Gomez if we get a good offer. I feel like he regressed heavily and is pretty average and isn't a guy you can count on staying fit either. 

Ownership needs to be sorted out before all of that anyway. Doubt they even think too much about summer transfers right now. Our club is insanely dysfunctional right now lol. Too much uncertainty. If FSG is still here in the summer and we miss CL, we will do fuck all lol. 

My dream would be 2-3 midfielders and a CB, maybe we can develop Doak into the RW cover Salah needs as well.",Liverpool,Yes,j6ysx23,t1_j6ykw31
">They did that under Fat Frank last time too. I'm not sure if they'll be harder to beat I think their team is just crap atm.

yes that was a joke. They spent their money on a whole new stadium but still got money to spent on players. While we only spent on expanding stands but still don't have money for new players,Liverpool,Yes,j6wcz1x,t1_j6wcf6n
"There‚Äôs a big difference between being annoyed at performances and it ruining your life though. That doesn‚Äôt sound like an interest/hobby, it sounds like a chore. 

That‚Äôs exactly what the line means though, your support shouldn‚Äôt waver because we‚Äôre having a bad year, and as I said, the owners aren‚Äôt the club. It‚Äôs not about the difference you‚Äôre personally making, if that was the case then none of us matter at all.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wonic,t1_j6wnqvh
I think both come as a package. Each one frightened the other will supersede them. Mo is too relaxed at the moment. I‚Äôve never seen a player smilie  every time when he misses !!  He needs competition for his place in the team. Mane may be having some problems but he‚Äôll come good again. Be nice to see them play together again.,Liverpool,Yes,j6ytr3y,t1_j6wocku
"there was no ""random link"". Is it really so hard to believe that someone might have some sort of contact at lfc? a bit of healthy skepticism surely isnt bad but this cynical r/nothingeverhappens attitude on reddit is pretty annoying",Liverpool,Yes,j6yz4lo,t1_j6yjaup
Yeh he's on 140k atm so presuming it would be cut to around 100k,Liverpool,Yes,j6xd3er,t1_j6xam51
I really don‚Äôt think Jota is similar to Man√© though. Probably in some areas like pressing or something but for ball retention and passing? Especially when they play centrally they are completely different players. I guess pace and power is the most noticeable difference.,Liverpool,Yes,j6wwbee,t1_j6wql0i
All our midfielders are fit..,Liverpool,Yes,j6z25g2,t1_j6z1tw2
"We have AOC, Thiago, Henderson, Milner, Fabinho, Bajcetic, Curtis, and Keita all fit currently. Why the FUCK would Isco be a good deal?

"Idk what you‚Äôre reading. 95% of what I‚Äôm seeing are people completely against him coming back, the other 5% are the idiots you speak about who are fine with him coming back but they‚Äôre being downvoted",Liverpool,Yes,j6xgiyn,t1_j6xe6h7
"I can't believe Gerrard/Torres partnership didn't win us silverware. Those two on their own just made us so beautiful on the counter that no team could deal with. In 2008 Zidane called Gerrard the best player in the world, and Torres was for sure the best 9.",Liverpool,Yes,j6zqchf,t1_j6zi8w0
"Hahahaha yeah all the girls in my school fancied the fuck out of him 

Unreal baller and good looking bastard too",Liverpool,Yes,j6zid14,t1_j6zi8w0
"Its pretty obvious he can play that role really well we seen it in 20/21 season a lot where he was able to retain possesion under pressure from multiple players consistently.

I don't think he's quite got that defensive reading of the game Gini had yet but he's only 22 I don't understand why people are whilling to give up on him when he's barely even played to warrant the stuff said about him.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wr2rv,t1_j6wqta4

Fair enough if it turns out he knows his stuff, I‚Äôd hold my hands up if that happened, would just like to see concrete proof of that first.

"The thing that I find most perplexing is I just don't get from a business perspective letting the first team erode.  By strengthening the squad, there are both short and long term benefits.

You get a 20ish games for the player to bed in and integrate into the squad.  It's one less player to buy during the summer.  If somehow everything goes well, you can make a push to get back into the CL, which is a MAJOR financial incentive worth somewhere between 50-100m.

The market isn't going to get more sane.  100m+ for Enzo was seen as a ridiculous price and in the end, Chelsea paid it.  50m for Caicedo this summer was deemed way too much for a player with such limited first team experience yet 6 months later, 60-80m was deemed a price 2 clubs were willing to pay.  The market is crazy and somehow, we think we're going to land the best young player in the world for a ""reasonable"" fee.

I'm just confused how the club haven't evaluated the situation and said ""Let's be honest, we can't put all our eggs in the Bellingham basket.  Let's sit down and figure out something else.  If somehow we do sign him and we've already signed a few other players, it's not like we couldn't sell a player or two to balance the budget / squad balance.

We clearly need at least two, but more realistically three midfielders given the expected outgoings in the midfield (Keita, Ox, maybe Milner but at this point I wouldn't mind him staying as a deep rotation option) as well as the loss of form from former mainstays (Fabinho, Henderson). I'm actually still optimistic Bellingham will come *if* he wants to, and I don't think one poor season will disuade him, but the thing that worries me is Bellingham alone won't cut it and won't help us out of this tough situation in the midfield. We need at the very least one more, but preferably two more.

But add to that defense is also looking like an area of the squad we'll need to spend in as well, namely center-back. Matip doesn't look like he is at the level he was a couple of seasons ago and Gomez only provides versatility positionally but he isn't good at this point. Besides, Gomez might be one of the few players who we could sell on for a decent fee (Kelleher and maybe Curtis the only other two). We'll need to also invest in the defense at this point, and that'll be costly as well. Someone like Gvadirol would be a dream, but forgive me for being too skeptical we'll spend on Gvadirol on top of Jude or whoever Jude's back-up is (which clearly isn't Enzo now despite it being the easier deal to be done compared to other back-up targets).

So work definitely needs to be done for sure. Midfield is the clear hole and clear issue that needs to be resolved in the summer, but with defense looking like an area that can't be ignored as well, it does leave me with a bit of worry on whether or not we can spend enough to be able to replenish the squad and add new pieces.",Liverpool,No,j6r16gl,t3_10qm41m

The odd chance of finding more than one midfielder with great potential and low price is getting slimmer and I think we are now past our best years of that era.

"Is it too late to recall Tyler Morton? I don't think he is the overall answer, but would offer more legs and has been impressing at Blackburn.

Also, with Konate being injured, I would actually start Phillips ahead of either Gomez / Matip. He never does anything to let us down and seems to actually enjoy defending. We are a soft touch.

And sod it, a 3rd option is to play a 4231. Thiago and Bajcetic in the 2, Elliott as a 10 with Gakpo left and Nunez in the middle. Can't be worse than the shower we've been seeing lately",Liverpool,Yes,j6r39nj,t1_j6r1zg0
"Low block, shit-housery, Nunez up top, Nat in defence.",Liverpool,Yes,j6r60ze,t1_j6r1zg0
"One is Bajcetic to keep playing regular minutes and see what happens and stick with it if Bajcetic hits a wall. That's key for our future. 

Would love to see Carvalho get more time too at least in attack and Elliott to play as a winger more often. 

We're in ""play young players for the future"" mode a la Chelsea in 2015-16, and while we don't have too much youth compared to Chelsea then, I'd still like to see those options.",Liverpool,Yes,j6r29o7,t1_j6r1zg0

"Juju and kit aesthetics aside, what frustrates me the most was all the talk of how the Nike deal was supposed to lift us to the next level commercially from a position of strength sporting-wise.

"I agree with this, all went to s#!t since Nike came to town!",Liverpool,Yes,j6t5ovp,t1_j6sgrkx
"Once the Super League died and City had their European ban overturned, that was it for FSG. They're selling up so they don't care about top 4 anymore. That's the new owners' problem.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rie0e,t1_j6rhj9p
"The only theory I can come up with is that they think they'll have sold the club by the summer and so can get away without spending the money at all. Nothing else makes sense. The money still needs spending, in January or in summer. At least now they could've de-risked somewhat.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rklj9,t1_j6rhj9p
"The only thing I can think of is that FSG is selling, they tell Jurgen, ""we'll give you x amount of money from now through the summer"" and he's(Klopp) decided to spend it all on Jude.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rhwg5,t1_j6rhj9p
I honestly go into every game expecting a draw or loss now. I don't know if it's reflective of our form or if it's because I am a pessimist.,Liverpool,Yes,j6ufecf,t1_j6u95l1
"Pearce put one out yesterday saying Klopp turned down any MF options in favour of signing Gakpo and after the summer, he thought he had enough depth. So Pearce is still in the pro-FSG column for now. But I‚Äôm sure Joyce will be releasing one soon saying big summer planned! 250m plus, doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs still FSG. Have certain players in mind and they weren‚Äôt available this window etc etc",Liverpool,Yes,j6r9biq,t1_j6r8ri6
Pearce just put one out. Says we have spent a lot of money in the last year but not well. Clown,Liverpool,Yes,j6raqps,t1_j6r8ri6
"Journalist: Pearce

Narrative: LFC tried to sign Enzo, Jude and prime Xavi and Iniesta but left it just too late to get the deal done.

Or, LFC wait to spend 250m warchest in the summer. (Maybe not this summer)",Liverpool,Yes,j6r95t1,t1_j6r8ri6
"I think it's a far less important factor for bigger clubs. 

The likes of Liverpool, United, Chelsea, City etc are always going to always going to be top destinations for players because they're never too far from their next European campaign. It's the West Hams, the Leicesters, the Brightons that suffer from not having that assurance.",Liverpool,Yes,j6uz3ty,t1_j6ulykc
"It really depends on the sporting project. Can we offer Bellingham an attractive proposition that we will build around him and challenge for major trophies? Robinho joined City instead of Chelsea at the start of Abu Dhabi's takeover. Then the likes of Dzeko, Yaya Toure, David Silva, Kolarov, and Tevez joined even though City had no CL football. You need an attractive sporting project plus offering good wages and playing time. That and a top manager (although Mark Hughes isn't what I consider a top manager).

We can offer that if we got new ownership and investment. With FSG? No chance in hell.",Liverpool,Yes,j6uni0c,t1_j6ulykc
"Aren't the rules of Champions League qualification changing next year too? I don't know much about what that means but I keep seeing people say we will likely qualify from 2024 regardless. 

As Klopp said, if a player is deterred by not playing in 1 season of Champion's League, that's not the player you necessarily want. That was directly after he praised Jude so publicly, so makes you wonder if that's been a conversation had BTS. 

If the project is good and you can see it's just because of a bad season for example and not an abject failure all around, I don't think it's a problem. Casemiro still went to United.

Unless you're going to RM, you can't guarantee CL every single year for anyone. With Arsenal, Chelsea, United and Newcastle all coming back, City may be fighting for top 4 in the next few years too.",Liverpool,Yes,j6uoony,t1_j6ulykc
"it depends.

If this was Liverpool 7 years ago before Klopp where we made CL like 2 times in 5 years, thats too much risk for top players to come to us because there was no merit. Bang average squad, bang average  coach, and no CL in sight.

The Liverpool now despite having a shit season is different. We might lose out in CL but for the past 7 years we have always been in CL, won it once and went to the finals 3 times.

We have one of the best coaches in the world and also an okay to good squad (minus the midfield) so there is way much merit for players to come here so a year without CL wouldn't be an issue for the players.

Now would our finances with current circumstances allow signing big players without CL would be a separate issue and likely would be a no.",Liverpool,Yes,j6uurrh,t1_j6ulykc
"The project is always more important than the position the club finished the previous year. You look at Spurs and Arsenal - one is in the CL the other is not, but guess which project looked better in the summer?",Liverpool,Yes,j6vdxcf,t1_j6ulykc
"Champions league will always have an impact for most players since playing in it will be the dream of many. Though in our case for Bellingham, I reckon one of the bigger factors is the process of rebuild itself. Would Bellingham be want to join us if he‚Äôs unsure our club is willing to spend to improve and rebuild?",Liverpool,Yes,j6ureqt,t1_j6ulykc
"It doesn‚Äôt start next season or we‚Äôd be getting a place if we‚Äôd miss our due to our coefficient

It starts the season after",Liverpool,Yes,j6suqsf,t1_j6so2ck
"His wife was a big factor of him extending; she said, we can't leave these people now. 

Klopp has said he wants to help rebuild, and his wish from the start was to leave the club in a better state than when he arrived.",Liverpool,Yes,j6r9y6i,t1_j6r9qoj
"If FSG is still in charge and they don‚Äôt back a full rebuild, yes I see him walking",Liverpool,Yes,j6r9xuc,t1_j6r9qoj
"I'd hope the atmosphere doesn't turn miserable. Boo the owners. Protest either side of the match itself, but it's not Klopp or the team's fault the owners fail to back them properly window after window. 

I want an outcome where we lose FSG, not Klopp. He deserves us rallying for him the whole 90 minutes.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rbbc4,t1_j6r9qoj
As long as he stays offline he'll be sound. He sees stuff like the away support the other day and knows he's still supported. Ultimately those who go the match are not reacting in the same way as those online.,Liverpool,Yes,j6rag5y,t1_j6r9qoj
When Boehly runs out of fifa points,Liverpool,Yes,j6sc8cu,t1_j6s4akv
Probably when Boehly gets bored.,Liverpool,Yes,j6s9jj5,t1_j6s4akv
It already has. They screwed over Ziyech who is furious with the club. Boehly isn't middle east oil rich and is using bank loans to fund these transfers that the club will have to pay back. People think he's just out there cutting personal checks. Boehly expects to make a profit from all of this. Chelsea aren't to be revered. They are the Titanic and we can just sit back and watch the collapse.,Liverpool,Yes,j6t6kuu,t1_j6s4akv

"Add him to the ‚Äúsupported Gerrard and/or Liverpool growing up, but joined a rival instead‚Äù bucket",Liverpool,Yes,j6u02rn,t1_j6th71k
"I honestly believe Klopp looks at the roster and is fine with the players he has. Why do we constantly make excuses for him? I believe that if he wanted a midfielder, he would have used the Gakpo money and got one. Klopp likes the players he has and probably feels we are a few players coming back from injury away from competing again.",Liverpool,Yes,j6t77wv,t1_j6t5sxw
We're Wengers Arsenal rn,Liverpool,Yes,j6rhtp0,t1_j6rcxp8
Never forget Odemwingie going to QPR for a medical before anything has been agreed and having to stay at his club after doing that,Liverpool,Yes,j6r75f0,t1_j6r6ior
"Honestly, I don't think it will be that big of an issue in the end.  I have absolutely no issue with Brighton saying no to a player with a contract and no release clause, but in all fairness, the offer(s) for him were more than fair and a player with ambition to both play at a higher level but also make a ton more money, it's also reasonable for him to push hard to get the move to happen.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rgodb,t1_j6r6ior
"Arsenal fans spent the last few days arguing with everyone how evil Brighton were to not let another key player walk so late in the window without a backup. Grrr, so evil of you Brighton!",Liverpool,Yes,j6r9ww1,t1_j6r6ior
That IG post seemed more like his agents than anything else. That‚Äôs why I felt sorry for him. Imagine being a young adult being some dreams about a record move which will help feed your family but your agents aren‚Äôt telling you the full story and they are telling you to push things through. Unfortunately that‚Äôs the way agents kind of prey on players,Liverpool,Yes,j6r7e0b,t1_j6r6ior

"He's clearly a player that needs to move on, especially after signing Gakpo and playing him centrally. Firmino also occupies a non-homegrown slot, which we are very tight with currently. 

We need a left footed forward that can play on the right, like Kudus, to have a proper six forward rotation. Salah needs real competition and neither Diaz nor Jota are comfortable there.",Liverpool,Yes,j6r9vp5,t1_j6r9lyv

"Would love to use this season as a way to give some of the youth some more game time. Might as well let them get the experience in a season like this. If we get the number of new players we need next year, they‚Äôll have less chances so let‚Äôs take this opportunity now.",Liverpool,Yes,j6qx7fy,t1_j6qwpl7
It is not strange when you consider the last stage is always 'Acceptance',Liverpool,Yes,j6rbl3f,t1_j6qwpl7
"yeah, I'd like to see Trent in the midfield too in some games. He is too good to be dropped entirely but he has been a liability at RB.",Liverpool,Yes,j6qx6vy,t1_j6qwpl7
"That's what happens when you have an owner with ambition. FFP is a joke, it's implementation is about as airtight as our defence and anyone who has the pockets can bend UEFA to their will.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rhe20,t1_j6re00s
"The even more frustrating thing is how we seemingly have no money at all but they can do that without batting an eye. Unless we're absolutely hemorrhaging money somewhere that we can't see, it just doesn't make sense.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rgfbe,t1_j6re00s
"FFP's been dead for a while, now they're just shagging the corpse.",Liverpool,Yes,j6reyu9,t1_j6re00s
"In that case, we‚Äôre 10 points of top 4‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs less than 4 games. With games in hand. There have been improvements every game since the Brighton thrashing, albeit small. Klopp said it isn‚Äôt going to get fixed overnight. The last game/loss wasn‚Äôt a walk over, it was a moment of lapse of concentration and a bit of brilliance from an incredible incredible player. Not saying we‚Äôll make top 4 but we‚Äôre not in a relegation battle and not all is lost.",Liverpool,Yes,j6reaa0,t1_j6rcji1
"with how the market is shaping up, there‚Äòs no possible way to sustain success with a sell to buy philosophy.  
pretty much every single other team in the league is getting better while we are getting significantly worse.  
you need owners that spend money to compete, it‚Äòs just like it is.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rd1e7,t1_j6rcji1
"You know there was a good bit of time where I was delighted that we had become a ""destination club"" rather than a ""feeder club"" for Barcelona/others. 

Now i feel that has become a bit of a thorny crown. Especially now that feeder clubs like Brighton and Fulham are above us in the table.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rf3jv,t1_j6rcji1
"I said a couple of seasons ago that we are going  to be the new Arsenal, looks like we're heading that way.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rf714,t1_j6rcji1
Not too big for a relegation scrap.,Liverpool,Yes,j6rgdr0,t1_j6rcji1
"I expect a rough couple of years, followed by a fall from grace from some of the clubs up there now. Arsenal won't continue investing at the rate they are. Chelsea have taken on a huge gamble on their future finances that may end with them flat on their face. United look good now but we'll see whether ten Haag can handle it when the entitlement starts to creep in from the fanbase.

Plenty of teams looking and playing well at the moment, but everyone has downturns. We're not in a good spot right now, but I'll be very interest to see what happens to some of these clubs when they're not in their honeymoon phase. Combine that with how a bit of smart business can do a lot for a club, and while things look bad right now, they don't look bleak.

All of the above of course goes out of the window if we get sold. At that point who knows what happens.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rlaii,t1_j6rcji1
"Sums up a lot of how I feel also. Really hard to take. Had Klopp just been backed that bit more theres a fair chance we'd have at least 1 more league title and who knows with another CL. 

If you add on top, the fact we clearly need some what of a rebuild, which I'm fairly certain FSG won't adequately deliver. Then it paints a depressing picture. 

Not even going to get into the ownership and who'd be a good fit but I can't see us getting back on top without new owners willing to spend more than we have been over past few years.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rdatw,t1_j6rcwi4
"I'm with you, I started supporting during Rafa's reign. 

I thought with Klopp we've finally arrived back to our perch and ready to build a dynasty or at least a legacy. 

We need owners to match our ambitions. It doesn't need to be an owner that spends for spending sake. But someone with ambition who will spend to at least try to win.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rdtgw,t1_j6rcwi4
"Ditto. Been a supporter for a similar timeframe and feel the same. Only transfer failure before all this that I remember is only if rafa had gotten David villa to go with torres, we would have won the league in 08. That was just one though, this feels worse.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rjbgy,t1_j6rcwi4
"FSG's model of self sustainablity just isn't (ironically) sustanable, you get to a point where all you're players that were succesful all get old at the same time due to the transfer profile they go for in terms of age bracket which leads to you not being able to sell them for good money which then leads to there not being enough money to consistently make transfers to rebuild.

There's other issues mixed in with this not just their model but it definetly only gets you to a certain point before a drop off.",Liverpool,Yes,j6romgj,t1_j6rnnxb
This is a conspiracy I can get behind,Liverpool,Yes,j6rzy8f,t1_j6rwlmn
"What's more likely? A group who consistently have the same issues, bringing those issues everywhere they go... or an intangible curse that no one particular person or group can be blamed or held accountable for? 

Because a lot of people love to say we're cursed but any suggestion that the people working at the club aren't absolutely perfect is met with aggressively claiming that you can't have a say unless you're working there yourself.",Liverpool,Yes,j6s0ax9,t1_j6rwlmn
"Wait, how does that even work? How would an algorithm create an injury crisis?

And why didn't we have an injury crisis last season, when we first started using Zone7's services?",Liverpool,Yes,j6s4zj8,t1_j6rwlmn
"Tbf, we were injury for most of last season thanks to Zone7 but like our ex-physio said on twitter, they‚Äôre still not good in certain areas.

I think the main culprit is that we are still on the same program that led us to a quadruple charge with the same set of players that were involved in a quadruple charge the year before.",Liverpool,Yes,j6sb04g,t1_j6rwlmn
">Forest can even spend more than us despite being in the championship a year ago.

"I can see it too, and I agree there has been too much smoke and I also don't agree with people saying one year out of Europe will affect Jude's desire to come to us *if* he does want to come to us. That would also at least partly explain the lack of action and the seeming acceptance of this being a lost season. 

The issue is Jude alone isn't enough. We'd need two more midfielders and honestly another center-back as well. That'd be a lot of money to spend even if FSG authorized a larger budget for the summer.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rco07,t1_j6rcazg
"I think so too. Mainly because this is our loudest pursuit since Virgil.

That's not to say there won't be plenty of doubt thrown into the mix over the next few months.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rd7ux,t1_j6rcazg
"There's only smoke, unfortunately. Gentlemen's agreement would make sense if Liverpool makes top 4, goes deep into champion's league. With no Europe, anybody would be mad to keep their word. And then you see how horribly the club's being run, you have to wonder, why would anyone waste their precious years coming here? Only people like Klopp can, maybe, convince him, if he has the backing of owners. And owners most likely just want to sell the club, now that there will be neither super league nor Europe (let's hope not). So there you have it.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rmmza,t1_j6rcazg
It has to be. Otherwise what we've been doing all this time is self sabotage on a completely different level.,Liverpool,Yes,j6rgoxq,t1_j6rcazg
I've had a player tell me first hand that he fully expects Bellingham to join us and that it's something we've been working on for a while. This was said last year. The way he talked about it made it sound like it was an open secret among players and I was way too excited to not 100% take his word for it lol.,Liverpool,Yes,j6rdakw,t1_j6rcazg

"To be fair he really shouldn't be getting the amount of abuse he does. I don't really care for Pearce's takes or reporting these days, but I also don't read his stuff anymore either, and I certainly don't @ him on Twitter.

Bilbao, La Real, Betis, Sevilla are fine with competing for Copa Del Rey, Europa League win and who gets top 4, but their quality will start to decline when bottom table PL clubs start beating them in the market.

The Bundesliga is a quality watch but there is 1 team who can compete with the PL. Same applies for Ligue 1 except  the ""quality watch"" part.

"As doom and gloom as it is atm, this is still Liverpool. It is still one of the biggest clubs in the world, no matter how badly the first half of the season has gone. It doesn‚Äôt automatically become a place players don‚Äôt want to play. United were bringing in big names and they were in years of a slump. We have had 6 months of bad. If we get decent backing and move away from the sustainability model, even if we aren‚Äôt in the CL for one season, it won‚Äôt make us a place players don‚Äôt want to come.

"From press side, very little has been said, which isn't to say nothing's happening but might mean nothing's far along enough to  break out as news.

The majority of the noise is coming from Twitter, and in particular a few different Qatari accounts who regularly allude to a bid from Qatar coming in for Liverpool.

Frankly I get a bad whiff of a few of these guys. Some act really strange, and especially like to interact, follow, and like extremely vocal ""#FSGOUT"" accounts, a decent amount of which only appeared after the announcement of the club being for sale late last year. It is entirely believable that despite how they act, they do in fact know enough about what's going on Qatar-wise, I just know there's also a lot of opportunists on Twitter happy to lead LFC fans on in a season where everyone's desperate for news, from anywhere.

Take it all with a heavy pinch of salt. I'm not really believing anything until it's getting substantial coverage in the papers. Until then, I think a lot of it is cope-bait.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rhafi,t1_j6rea09

Winning trophies is great, but to me what is more important is that I enjoy watching us week-to-week, for that reason my personal favourite seasons to watch were 13-14 and 17-18. I just don't think that in today's competitive environment we're ever gonna have seasons like that again under FSG. 

We might have a few great CL nights and win a cup, but if it comes at the price of a long-term collapse into dull mediocrity then count me out.  

I'd rather have competitive owners and watch Liverpool pushing for leagues and CL's for years to come. And who knows...with proper backing we can probably win that lost CL in the future but with a far more exciting project than our current mess.",Liverpool,Yes,j6sxc2y,t1_j6sb660

"Fuck the Europa League. If we miss CL, I'd rather we go all-out for the league next year (assuming we get the reinforcements we need in summer). We've had some great Europa League ties, to be fair, but mostly it's just a way to pick up injuries and fatigue our squad and the chances of securing CL that way are pretty low. It's not as much fun for us supporters but I get the feeling the squad could use a season where we *don't* play 900 games.

Finding themselves short in midfield and short on time, they secure a quick loan deal for Sabitzer. Even if he turns out not particularly good, he's a body in the middle of the park and for the life of me I can't figure out why we couldn't manage something similar with a whole transfer window at our disposal.

"Go back to 18/19. It‚Äôs not outrageous to say our best midfield was going to be Keita, Fabinho and Ox. Unfortunately injuries ruined those main 2. Henderson was starting but was poor those first 6-8 months. Gini was Gini. Milner was ageing.",Liverpool,Yes,j6r7jif,t1_j6r5zdn

Ox was a good talented player and we saw that in 17/18 but he had always had injury problems so no shock it's ended up like this.

And pretty sure Karius was young player of the year in Germany before he came. So again on paper not the worst signing.

">I don‚Äôt think money is an issue when it comes to signing midfielders.

I doubt it too. We all thought we didn't get a midfielder because we were broke but money for Gakpo someone came into existence. 

>At this point I am confident that we are not signing midfielders because we already have enough 

That is not a good excuse since we know we were strongly linked to Tchouam√©ni and since we got Arthur in on loan as a panic signing. Its clearly mismanagement and poor squad planning.

Besides all that, we always hear Klopp talking about prospective midfielders needing to be ""the right player"" whilst hyping up the midfielders he already has when he doesn't ever do that for other positions. We also know that regardless of their form this season, he's picked Hendo and Fabinho to play more minutes than almost any other midfielder he has and only changed things around in January. Above all, with the way we get linked to Bellingham and the fact we haven't gotten any midfielders despite being in a crisis where we've already made a significant signing makes me think those in charge only want him. Perhaps Matheus Nunes as well. And knowing Klopp's stubbornness, i think its a reasonable assessment. 

I may get downvoted but i really don't think people put enough blame on Klopp for the situation of this particular season.

On Keita and Ox: I do think we tried to sell them but they are injury prone and on a combined ¬£240k. Its probably proven too difficult to move them on.

Milner: Is actually playing well right now and not even in Midfied. The bigger question would be why he's playing RB and why Calvin Ramsey seems to not be getting chances.

Hendo: In retrospect, it looks bad because its a 4 year contract. Don't forget, he was one of our most important players in 19/20 (we tendes to play worse without him) and was very dependable in 20/21. The contract was deserved, but in Hindsight, it should have been a 2 year contract.",Liverpool,Yes,j6qxbvb,t1_j6qvad4

"Well, it's injury monitoring/prevention software that gives you stuff like ""injury risk forecasting"" and ""load management"". 

So, I'm not saying this *has* happened, but it's certainly possible that their algorithm, for example, is optimized (intentionally or not) for single-season performance in a way that actually raises the risk of injury over multiple seasons. 

To be clear, I know nothing about their algorithm or the data that it's trained with. I'm just saying that kind of thing is possible ‚Äì it certainly wouldn't be the first time a machine learning algorithm produced an undesired long-term result.

And that is one of the common pitfalls of ML: it will optimize ruthlessly for whatever ""goal"" you give it. So if it was (for example) trained with the goal of ""minimize injuries this season,"" it might well make recommendations that would have a negative impact in later seasons, because it doesn't *care* about later seasons.

15/16 isn‚Äôt a bad season. We had the EL run, some great wins in the league and a league cup final.

20/21 isn‚Äôt a bad season either. We secured top 4 and took the end of season momentum into 21/22 where we nearly completed football.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rblct,t1_j6rawpp

"I don‚Äôt believe Karius was budget option, we needed a goalkeeper and he was identified as the one and we know that turned out which led to us breaking the transfer record for a goalkeeper on Alisson.

I agree but Rashford has more goals and Neymar is equal with Mo. Mbappe also has more but I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôre classing him as a winger,Liverpool,Yes,j6rzeeu,t1_j6rxjb9
"Well the attack would be Diaz, Gakpo, Nunez, Firmino and Jota. Elliot and Fabio could also serve as back-up. Technically it would work selling him and before anyone says ""he scores all our goals"" there is only a certain amount that is possible to score. We have seen before how it effects players when the top scorers leave (Cavani, Benzema).

I'm not saying it is easy, but if there is one part of the team where we actually have enough players to sell our best one it is definetly the attack. His sale could fund a midfielder and possibly another winger to replace him down the line. If we actually are serious about reviving the team, we can't only talk about getting rid of Hendo, Milner, Keita etc. Those won't bring money in. Out of Salah, VVD and Ali personally I think Alisson will stay at top level the longest with Salah and VVD on second place because of VVDs injury.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rxlmy,t1_j6rwobz

"> We need more than a holding midfielder, we need probably 2 more at least and another defender 

Not in terms of our first team we don't. Bring in a holding midfielder and we can play a two man midfield then 4 forward players in whatever combination we fancy.

The problem lies in when injuries or schedule force changes to that line-up. That's where we'll need players to replace our outgoings in midfield, and the defender you mention.

On a related note, it's great to see someone who isn't on a mad rampage or shitting their pants at the current situation. It's shit but fixable as you say.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rvw8d,t1_j6rmxns
"> fixes our **first team**

> Most of our problems going forward are gonna be **depth related**

These are the key bits of what I said. Thiago being the only reliable midfielder completely fits with that, as we bring in that holding midfielder and play a two man midfield.

"Except Nunez has played there for club and country before (and had his best games for us at LW if you recall), and Gakpo played better there for us than when we tried him at LW because he's clearly not pacey enough to be a PL winger. A hallmark of Klopp's system has always been flexibility and forwards playing across the line, people acting like it's some wild notion is bizarre.

"The only reason 40million will get us 'average' midfielders is because we aren't savvy enough to get business done at the right times.

I wouldn't want Jorginho personally but ¬£12m this window, Sabitzer moved on loan, Mckennie moved on loan not world beaters but you don't need much to improve our midfield atm.

It just makes me laugh because we genuinely have one of the worst midfields in the league but people on here saying there's no point signing someone for ¬£40m because they'll be average. Diaz, Konate, Thiago, Salah, Mane, Robbo, Jota, Fabinho, Gini were all signed for under ¬£40m. Signing players for under that and turning them to world beaters was our thing for 6 years.

>AND you and your SOS pals want to disqualify most of the interested buyers from the bidding process with that owner review plea.

There are hundreds of different ways to run a football club and whatever Liverpool do will always be unique to Liverpool. There are people who are currently unhappy with FSG but have a tonne of reservations about a sale, people who are unhappy with FSG and want a specific kind of sale, people who just want new players and don‚Äôt care about anything else and, yes, some people who are broadly speaking happy with the last 10 years as a whole.

We finished 8th and won nothing. You'll forgive me for not agreeing, i'm sure.

>20/21 isn‚Äôt a bad season either. We secured top 4 and took the end of season momentum into 21/22 where we nearly completed football.

We finished 30 points lower than the previous season and had a stretch where we lost 6 matches in a row at home. Again, you'll forgive me for not thinking it was a success.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rcpg1,t1_j6rblct

"It's been a bit unfair of Nunez I think. He's come into an unstable side which switches personnel every game. It's why I'm hesitant to judge him, as well as gakpo this season. 

Nunez has been good. Missed a lot of chances though. When he hasn't played, you can really tell now. The game against Chelsea, Brighton and wolves showed it. We had no outlet to chase the long balls that we've been doing. 

I think it will click with Nunez and he will be fine. Before the world cup he was in good form.",Liverpool,Yes,j6s5k5w,t1_j6s4cf6
"In a not-so-perfect world (i.e. not that unrealistic world), Ox would have been a regular for a long time if not for that ACL injury. People forget how great he was in 2017-18, especially in Champions League. Energy, pace, pressing with good finishing too for a midfielder. 

Keita was the perfect target then, especially when you remember how he played at Leipzig. Strong presser and dominant. Injuries and just not being as consistent (though usually good when healthy which wasn't often) has hurt him.",Liverpool,Yes,j6r6g3j,t1_j6r69f8
"No, the reasons why they didn‚Äôt work out is because injuries ruined them. That‚Äôs not because of their quality, they‚Äôve just been unlucky.

">before anyone says ""he scores all our goals"" there is only a certain amout that is possible to score.

Yeah but its also a fair point, even with him being shit post WC he's still our top goalscorer and has consistently scored minimum 30+ goals a season for us in all comps so you have to find somone that replaces at least 90% of those goals.

The only way round it is by buying a winger who is more focused on creating goals than scoring which leads to Darwin picking up the goals Salah would've had, Gakpo should be that winger since he is more of a playmaker but the plan for him seems to be used to centrally for some reason.",Liverpool,Yes,j6ry4ac,t1_j6rxlmy

">Considering he was valued at ¬£110m before the midfielder market pumped up, there‚Äôs no way he goes for under ¬£140m.

The numbers that have came from German Journo's like Plattenberg consistently have been between ¬£100m-¬£130m is what they are looking for, Dortmund ended up selling Sancho for cheaper than what they previously wanted as well due to him wanting to leave they don't really operate like most other clubs when it comes to selling players.",Liverpool,Yes,j6s9uuw,t1_j6s8drm

"Jones is only just 22, plenty of time to develop for a CM and the fact he's scouse (and therefore homegrown) is useful. He's had such weird luck with injuries, and before then was looking great. I have hope.

My criteria was basically ""do I see them being in the squad of the next great Liverpool team?"" assuming that'd be in 2-3 seasons. If not, why keep them around? Give a new squad time to grow together. Thiago won't be. Robbo might be, but probably not starting and potentially not at all, he's 29 before the season ends. Van Dijk was almost off the list...

I thought we should start wielding the axe last summer, hopefully this season has been so bad there's less sentimentality guiding keeping people around.",Liverpool,Yes,j6s1p1w,t1_j6rppv0

"We have replaced him. We‚Äôve got Nunez, Gakpo, Diaz, Jota, Salah, Carvalho all when fully fit. That‚Äôs more than enough, those players just need time together, but yeah I‚Äôd agree I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a major priority at all and imo we wouldn‚Äôt need an extra body there.

We desperately need to sort out a midfield, I‚Äôd actually say if we got midfielders that have the legs, keeping Bobby around would be useful. But at the moment we can‚Äôt dominate the ball can only rely on scoring in transition, and he just doesn‚Äôt have the pace to keep up and slows down our attacks",Liverpool,Yes,j6rbuuh,t1_j6rbkrq
"Ramsey doesn't exist at the moment, and bedding him in the team at such dire situation would be detrimental to his development. Milner is old and can't play 90mins each week despite his annual fitness achievement each summer.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rds4f,t1_j6ra47y
"I think you've misunderstood my point a little here. Yes, we should have done more sooner to not end up in this position and yes, there are plenty of players who could improve the squad. I'm just saying that from their perspective that this season is a write off regardless. The 30-40 mil price point is arbitrary. Bringing in Jorginho, Sabitzer or Mckennie isn't going to win us the Champions League or get us top four this year. They're not enough to remedy the underlying systemic issues. Yes, we'd play better and win more games but from FSG's cold horrible bastard perspective that doesn't matter. Why bring someone in whose impact will be, in their eyes, immaterial? 

Then you've got another mediocre midfielder (that we'd have overpaid for as everyone knows we're desperate) clogging up the squad next year instead of Ox and Keita. More spending and more deadweight so that we can come fifth instead of seventh? 

I couldn't disagree with that decision more, but anyone who is baffled by this choice hasn't been paying attention to how FSG conduct themselves as owners",Liverpool,Yes,j6sf4p5,t1_j6s1fhh

"I'm literally agreeing with you that he shouldn't be getting abused. But also he isn't above getting criticism, which it sounds like you disagree with.

Pearce is a mouthpiece for the club and isn't a real journalist. A real journalist would take information and make well-written opinion pieces. The club just uses him to try and sway public opinion in favor of them. John Henry has a history of doing this, he bough the biggest news outlet in Boston so he could control the local narrative around the red sox. No Boston Globe journalist writes bad pieces about the red sox. He's using a similar playbook here. 

One of the many Perace agenda examples was when he spent all summer defending the club and saying that we weren't going to spend because we were ""Saving up for Bellingham"". Then less than 36 hours after the summer window closed he wrote a piece saying that the club is worried the competition and price may be too high for Bellingham. It was clear as day the directive was to dangle the Bellingham carrot out to the fans to quell any complaints about spending and then once the window closes to now start the PR train of slowly walking the fans off of the Bellingham train.

Jota is so underrated by a lot of our fans. As you said he could pull a goal out of his arse and even during a quiet game he would still put in a massive shift defensively. Jota was an absolute beast against City before going down injured,Liverpool,Yes,j6r7u62,t1_j6r78b6

But no, we won't do this. I love Ali, VVD and Salah etc., but they shouldn't be here in 7 years (maybe Ali could). I don't get how we are supposed to get money if we refuse to sell players to reinvest it? We can't rely on selling Keita, Hendo, Ox and Philips because that doesn't cut it. And if we haven't got money to buy why can't Klopp and the staff adapt?

Agree with it or not, I don't care (and no, I don't agree with it either) The team bought Gakpo because he was at a much cheaper price right now due to PSV's financial issues, and Klopp expected him to help out the midfield (somehow). Also partially because of our current injuries. They didn't sign a midfielder because the team did not expect such a huge drop off in form from Henderson/Fabinho, they missed out on their initial targets Tchoumeni and weren't able to get Jude. Huge oversight obviously. I have no idea why they didn't sign a midfielder in this window, but Klopps reason is ""the right player wasnt available"".",Liverpool,Yes,j6ranwi,t1_j6r94e1
"Okay so in your opinion, Jota starts ahead of Bobby and Nunez when they're all fully fit?",Liverpool,Yes,j6raaz5,t1_j6ra4id
