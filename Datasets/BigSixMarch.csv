"Two rather unremarkable moments from Vieira stood out to me last night.  First, he had the ball in the left half space and made a simple pass to Eddie, but he remained in his space - I think he did this a couple of times.  This is the kind of thing I want to watch back again because, in the moment, it seemed pretty disciplined to not make the run in following the pass - which was something he did in other situations. 

The second was when he nicked the ball off Davies on the right sight and played a switch to KT on the LW.  Looked like a proper DLP.  Both of these moments stood out because they were ""midfielder"" plays rather than ""attacking midfielder"" or ""attacking"" types of plays.  

There is a whole lot that goes into playing the 8s in this team, and I thought both of these pretty small moments were good examples of how Vieira has matured and developed this season.  Looking forward to him getting some game time in the coming weeks.",Arsenal,No,jamb8pq,t3_11fwyxk

- Watched highlights of Totenscum game, and banter and hilarity of them getting dumped out of FA Cup aside, it was baffling to me that Kane and Romero and some other players who start regularly for them didn’t start! You’re off the pace in PL, chances in UCL are low (literally for every club except RMad), so The FA Cup provides a genuine realistic chance of silverware in the season, it’s a crucial game, a big game, and the main player doesn’t even start?

"Good morning lads, cloud day here in North London today. 

Mathematically city can only reach a total of 94 points if they win all of their remaining 13 games. Therefore the title winning threshold to guarantee it is currently 95 points. 

We are 63.8% of the way to this target, each three points we earn is a huge contributor to winning it. 

A 34 point haul is required, which is at least 11 wins and a draw from our remaining 13 games. 

Tottenham can only reach 84 points from their remaining 13 games. Therefore the threshold for top 4 is 85 points. 

We are 70.59% of the way to this target. Tottenham will almost certainly drop more points like against Leicester (4-1 lmao) so this will likely reduce radically. If we assume 75 points (the standard total) we are 80% of the way to champions league football.",Arsenal,No,jalpibc,t3_11fwyxk
"A few thoughts on last night:

 - Not only a hugely important 3 points, but a hugely important vendetta win against a side we never should have dropped 3 points to in the first place. It happens, whatever, I don't want to relitigate that fixture, but it is extremely important for our continued success that this squad keeps finding motivation to rectify each and every mistake or missed opportunity. I felt it in the United home fixture too, this added ""fuck you"" attitude we have in those revenge games, the physicality is raised, confidence is sky high. Those are all factors that are massive for EL and CL knockout stages, good to see we already have some of that in us.

 - Trossard coming in and basically replicating the very particular and demanding role that Jesus was performing before the World Cup might just prove to be the X-factor we needed for the second half of the season. I'm not writing off Eddie, he's a good and necessary squad player, even last night he proved how dangerous he can be when the game is more open. But we also needed someone more similar to Jesus, and what a shrewd piece of business the Trossard deal was, highway robbery if you ask me. Once Jesus is back to full fitness as well, it's all over for these low block hoes.

 - Jorginho didn't have the best of games, but it was great to see Thomas fit enough to play an entire half, he bossed it, hopefully he's fit to start on Saturday.

 - Saka and Martinelli are somehow both Him, he comes in many forms apparently. When you factor in age and potential, I don't think there's a single club in the world barring Real Madrid who wouldn't swap wingers with us in a heartbeat. Blessings on blessings.

 - I've often been critical of him when I thought it was fair, so I should also be equally flattering when it is earned - Fabio Vieira looked like the real deal last night. Every touch was imperious, he had the game in the palm of his hand since the moment he came on. Don't expect him to be at that level every game at this stage in his career, but last night he looked class, man like David Silva and them.

 - Don't sell Tierney, he's so good. Things are going so well, we know Zinchenko is injury prone, don't create problems out of nothing. Who cares if he's not perfectly happy, it's not like he's stopped coming to training, and  he'll have more playing time between now and the end of the season. If we sold him, we are back to where we were last season where at any point we are one Zinchenko knock or sprain from having our entire season in crisis. Don't sell Tierney man.

 - Emile looked extremely off the pace, but I don't even care, it was just good to be reminded we have this lad. Even if it takes him until the end of the season to find his form, just play him as often as we can. We know he has the talent, let him work his way back and knock on wood he stays fit.

"Our tactical and positional flexibility is honestly remarkable. Everton came prepared and shut down Saka pretty well for 40 minutes yesterday. Okay cool, now how do your left back deal with marking both Saka and Martinelli while facing our left back. 

Our second goal had Martinelli on the right as well and our third had Trossard on the left. 

Our winner against Leicester had Trossard on the left, feeding Martinelli on the inside as well.  

It takes intelligent players to do - how do the rest of the team move, when the left back and left winger are suddenly both on the right - but it also takes a special manager to not only devise it, but to also communicate it to his players in a way that enables them to enact it on the pitch. And honestly, I think that's one of Arteta's strongest points. His feedback and ideas are translatable in game.

It all started in 2008 when I was in an internet cafe in India and decided to try playing computer games for the first time. I started FIFA 08 and just selected first team on default selection it happened to be Arsenal.

I liked the sound of all player names for the next hour and started reading about them and finally landed on Arsenal premier league pages and then fantasy premier league and selected Fabregas in the team and made him captain. That week I watched the first game which is Arsenal 6 - 2 Everton. Fabregas got around 44 points and he pushed me to top 100 or something in fantasy league.

Then I followed all matches each week and selected fantasy premier league. Before I know it this became a personal ritual and I forgot fantasy premier league altogether and I am very much invested in the arsenal team fortunes. My friends who are fans of Man utd, chelsea et al used to kock me for selecting Arsenal as my team to support but that never bothered me.

I did not see peak glory days like some of you fans but that also never bothered me. There is some connection and satisfying feeling seeing that kit and style of play.

"Something I’ve noticed recently - we see martinelli much less often dispossess defenders with his pressing. 

We used to absolutely adore this quality when he broke into the side. 

My guess is that it’s systematic. Our pressing patterns have changed: think about Alexis. Pressing monster, but how often did his over agressive press leave a man unmarked?

High risk, high reward.

What I’ve noticed with this arsenal team is that we’re not as concerned with actually getting the ball from opponents in the final third. Instead, the pressing plan (similar to how city do it) is all about cutting off the middle of the pitch, forcing a keeper or a CB long, and then winning a 2 v 1 in our back line. 

As a result, martinelli presses less to win the ball, but more to force a bad pass.

Especially after hearing that podcast interview, can't remember which one, but he came across very humble and likable. And he's been pure quality since he got his chance when Auba left, imo. I love how we've looked the last couple games, but I'm battling my own self not sure if it's an improvement over our regular Martinelli, Nketiah, Saka front three we've had. I feel like Eddie's got quality in the box neither Martinelli nor Troussard have which can create a goal out of nothing when you least expect it.

As much as they get a lot of criticism I have to commend the people at AFTV for sticking with the club and building their own brand. Fans like myself felt so disconnected that I even stopped watching our games coz of how angry I used to get. Some of the AFTV guys are extremely toxic( I won’t mention names) but overall a positive atmosphere.,Arsenal,No,jaoo0br,t3_11fwyxk
Not convinced that Martinelli’s goals yesterday have as much to do with Trossard being on the pitch as they do with a tactical adjustment with him being instructed to move centrally more often. Eddie literally assisted one of Martinelli’s goals.,Arsenal,No,jalp5x7,t3_11fwyxk

In America when I talk to fans of rival clubs they seem to have nothing bad to say about us, (some Man City fans bitch that we ‘took’ Jesus, Zinchenko & Arteta, which is just dumb) I’m wondering what the sentiment is like surrounding our current squad/standing in UK amongst fans of other clubs..",Arsenal,No,jaloloo,t3_11fwyxk

He would be a great rotation option for Zinny and tierney would get an opportunity to continue his development at a high level CL team where he will start.  I love tierney but I think keeping the system consistent and effective will be crucial if we want to make a deep UCL run next year and that means Zinny role depth.",Arsenal,No,japptpq,t3_11fwyxk

Edit: Knocking on wood as I typed this not to jinx it.",Arsenal,No,jam4cy0,t3_11fwyxk
"How will/should we go about squad additions as it stands?

Do we want a right back in the mould of Zinchenko and move Tomi to RCB, or do we want to add an RCB outright. Should we move for a Zinchenko like LB if KT leaves, or would a left side White like profile be beter? 

Do we want to add an 8/10 to the squad or do we just want an 8? If the Gary Jacobs report is anything to go by, do we want both Caicedo and Rice or is it a one or the other case? I personally want to see more goals/assists from the left mid side because although Xhaka is good, we can upgrade there. 

We'll likely move for a right winger, but who could that be? 

What do we do with Balogun, especially if our desire is a taller striker? Is bringing in a third striker regardless (like Hojlund) a good move?

Such poise! Such NOISE!!

They only look potent when their first team is playing but they do look potent then. Sancho still remains an unknown quantity as well. They're in a similar setting to when Arteta had Auba firing, but with a much better squad.

"I am going to be the first to say, I expect us to continue building on whatever happens this year. 

We are on the right side of age curves. 

We actually play like the protagnist/main character energy.

We have manager who has built the culture and has tactical nous.

Arteta + Board learned after the first year that shortcuts weren't going to close the gap (Soares, Mari, Willian) since then our pick ups have been good to great.

Where I think there is some merit is that one, we currently have to swing a little over over our weight class to really compete money wise with the manchester clubs + newcastle + chelsea (we will see overtime how long boehly wants to burn money)  long term. Further depending on FSG's moves they might i guess go the way of the Oil.

I haven't read the article but it's easy to guess they are alluding to the financial power and potential Qatari ownership.

Perhaps a more realistic concern is just looking at the dominance of Liverpool and how quickly they got flipped around. less then a year ago they were a chasing a quadruple with a real opportunity to do so.

Long-term they made some bad decisions keeping guys and not refreshing their midfield.

All it takes is one mistep by us or liverpool and it becomes very difficult to make up the difference in buying power compared to some of our rich competitors.

Right now, we have an excellent opportunity for the league. Even if we get it. What is to stop PSG from looking at Saliba and going I'll have that and offering him like insane personal terms. We could match, and I hope we try, but his relationship with club has been up and down, he might decide France is better for him personally, plus a bump, all but guaranteed champions league.

Then we have to do our best to stop other guys in the room thinking about our prospects. Maybe if that happens, a guy like Martinelli who I think we should be able to get done, maybe Madrid or Barcelona comes in with wicked terms too, he has a decision to make, which we gotta match because we cant let guys like that walk and expect Saka to be happy with that.  

Suddenly our shopping list gets bigger and expectations will be sky high. It's one thing to have our pockets lined by PSG, it will be another to replace a guy like that. 

Even coming out on top of the league there is a scary potential of an avalanche.

 TLDR: Even if we finish top, there is going to be interest in our best young talent (Saliba, Martinelli, Saka etc.) Teams like PSG, Barcelona, Real Madrid, and god forbid teams in our league are at least going to kick tires. I dont think it will, but with other teams improving (Utd and Newcastle), City is going anywhere unless they lawyers have got worse. That's already three teams that aren't us that are going to try narrow the gap.",Arsenal,Yes,janw4eu,t1_jangmir
"His winning back of the ball quickly created quite a few opportunities, particularly for Gabi/Trossard/Eddie on the left and slight left of center.",Arsenal,Yes,jam59lt,t1_jam2df8
"remember when they were on about a powershift in north london, i wonder how that is tasting right now",Arsenal,Yes,jalkvuw,t1_jalkoro
"It's abundantly obvious from how good he is for brazil that he doesn't fit into that tottenham side at all. I think Jesus is clear but richarlison is better than this, counter attacking football isn't his strong suit. He thrives in a more possession based system like brazil's.

Unironically think if we had him he'd be balling for us",Arsenal,Yes,jalrk60,t1_jalqni4
"We've already done 5-0 at home this season, I'm sorry but I have to insist on 6-0.",Arsenal,No,jalva6i,t1_jalt3p1
Honestly I prefer we lead by 2 or 3 then sub all our key players off to preserve them. Longevity is critical.,Arsenal,No,jalz1ze,t1_jalt3p1
"Its hilarious seeing them justify always losing and genuinely arguing that they don't have the depth to compete for a cup. They have a £60m striker, £45m wingback and a £43m CB who are all firmly backups and they still lost to a Championship team's backup team.",Arsenal,No,jaltw1j,t1_jalt3p1
let's hope they drop points to make it less stressful,Arsenal,Yes,jama8wk,t1_jam9kyk
Martinelli and his movement in particular are criminally underrated.,Arsenal,Yes,jam8ibh,t1_jam6xme
"Gueye also fell asleep and slid centrally which opened the passing angle for Zinny, really captured how switched on footballers need to be for 90 minutes straight. Then he had the giveaway that led to the second.",Arsenal,Yes,jam7y9j,t1_jam6xme
"If we win this title that goal will be the Overmars at OT goal where you point to and say that’s the goal
That won us the league. 
Huge goal for us.",Arsenal,Yes,jancpf3,t1_jamodk8
"Brighton. Very impressive and really respect the way that they play. Fell in love with Arsenal because of how we played, so have respect for a team that plays positively.",Arsenal,Yes,japbanp,t1_jaowlir
"Nottingham Forest. The original big club. Rich history, European champions. Plus they are the reason we wear red.",Arsenal,Yes,jap69h5,t1_jaowlir
"Newcastle pre takeover.

West Ham",Arsenal,Yes,jap1jg0,t1_jaowlir
"It’s definitely the most balanced, no glaring weaknesses at all",Arsenal,Yes,japw0de,t1_japr1ob
It's close tbh. The 07 team was brilliant. I personally liked the 2010 team a lot too. I think now we're closer to be a proper unit of a team rather than a team carried by a few superstars or a single superstar like in the auba days or the nasri rvp and cesc days.,Arsenal,Yes,japsyqw,t1_japr1ob
Everything considered - this squad,Arsenal,Yes,japtjb0,t1_japr1ob
"yes, easily",Arsenal,Yes,jaqbpfq,t1_japr1ob
Good sensation,Arsenal,Yes,jalk8i0,t1_jalk5o4
Newcastle have tailed off lately and palace/pool are terrible,Arsenal,Yes,jam0619,t1_jalzwhi
Came here to say the same. He could use a start as much as Xhaka could use a rest.,Arsenal,Yes,jam4sm9,t1_jam0ib0
Big ears is not a realistic target. A deep run will be good next season,Arsenal,Yes,jam7cuz,t1_jam4az8
Only game prior to the Everton away one where we weren’t in complete control. We weathered the storm but man I was screaming nooooo noooo noooo like a horror film when the penalty was given at the end. My goodness I was grateful for VAR that day,Arsenal,Yes,jao8sc8,t1_jao1o0w
Leeds are the Tottenham of the north.,Arsenal,Yes,jao2bi9,t1_jao1o0w
Saka with a match winner is how. Plus Bamford missed a pen and Gabriel had a pretty good game. We were rubbish though and very lucky to get three points. If I remember correctly that was the game after Liverpool where Jesus had taken a hard blow to the head and hit the floor like a sack of potatoes. He was definitely playing like he had mild concussion in that game lol,Arsenal,Yes,jaoifkf,t1_jao1o0w
I hate Barca,Arsenal,Yes,jaog5kq,t1_jaoe87s
"Napoli and Arsenal are clearly top 5 in Europe this year, would love to see both do the double.",Arsenal,Yes,jaoki6y,t1_jaoh05t
"I think we will win the CL at least once in the next five years, and make it to the semis at least in most campaigns. Arteta really is just that guy.",Arsenal,Yes,jaohx4t,t1_jaoh05t
"Probably best you put this in caps!

It’s normally our fan base crapping on Martinelli, others love him unconditionally especially Liverpool! Hell I’ve seen comments recently that Klopp should sign him in the summer to get Liverpool back on top.",Arsenal,Yes,jalncgq,t1_jalmyg1
 the funniest thing is that if the World Cup didn’t happen then every United fan would genuinely believe that Rashfords better than mbappe,Arsenal,Yes,jalnahd,t1_jalmyg1
That whole Man United team is on a purple patch post-WC. Can't wait till that ends.,Arsenal,Yes,jalpa6o,t1_jalmyg1
Apparently some still need this reminder.,Arsenal,Yes,jamp4kh,t1_jamogtp
"Icing on de cake ESR is getting some minutes,, rusty yeah but his commitment is there, he'll be alrite",Arsenal,Yes,jalkr6r,t1_jalkljq
"If we win the league I ask man whose better than Thomas Partey in an Arsenal midfield ever? Vieira, Brady, Fabregas who else fam… Petit maybe, Davis/Thomas/Storey/Edu/Gilberto no no no Partey is better footballer than those greats.",Arsenal,Yes,jalp239,t1_jalm1wv
Gabriel is 100% going to be our record breaking transfer sale in the next 3/4 years. Can see Madrid coming in and offering something stupid at some point,Arsenal,Yes,jalmj99,t1_jalm1wv
Conveniently forgotten by our critics who think we’ve been lucky to play teams without their own best players.,Arsenal,Yes,jalu4ip,t1_jalsbpa
also ESR getting minutes again is fantastic. remember that period when he was THE super sub? gonna be some good shit in the frustrating matches to come,Arsenal,Yes,jalw5um,t1_jalsbpa
Which is crazy because I think Odegaard is one of the players who is furthest away from his potential.,Arsenal,Yes,jammfsg,t1_jamgakg
He’s not really a number 10 but I agree nonetheless.,Arsenal,Yes,jamky9c,t1_jamgakg
"It's incredible. We've been saying for a few years, once he perfects his finishing, he's going to be a superstar. Well here it is.",Arsenal,Yes,jamriuy,t1_jamrbxh
"Yeah, with 13 games left, I can't pretend to myself that I wouldn't be gutted. If we finished second and won Europa, that would be a decent consolation though",Arsenal,Yes,jan3m7m,t1_jan0jri
"Season 13/14 taught me to keep a distance until last 8 games. We were leading the top right until March, quite a PTSD.",Arsenal,Yes,jan16pz,t1_jan0jri
"I am secretly hoping that Amazon ""forgot"" to take out some cameras and we get one for this season.

A man can dream!",Arsenal,Yes,japoiqe,t1_japkbf6
"I have the final episode to go for a while but can’t bring myself to watch knowing the disappointment, hoping to watch it at the end of this season looking back with new found joy.",Arsenal,Yes,japocmt,t1_japkbf6
I’ll watch it after we win the title,Arsenal,Yes,japsngn,t1_japkbf6
"Palace have been a little bit of a bogey team for City so never know.

Really hoping Newcastle play the same way they did against us to City and shithouse their way to another 0-0 draw.

That being said - I can also see City winning that match anyways",Arsenal,Yes,jallyd1,t1_jallt49
"Palace can't score to save their life. Even if they do, they absolutely suck at protecting a lead.

That being said, they're one of City's bogey teams.",Arsenal,Yes,jallv9s,t1_jallt49
I think they'll turn Newcastle over then get stung by Palace. It's how their season has gone,Arsenal,Yes,jalmlli,t1_jallt49
People thought the same after the WC but we were back to winning ways.,Arsenal,Yes,jalrk8y,t1_jalr99r
"Thinking back to that tierney injury for Scotland last year. Such a fucking pointless endeavour, I have no end of hatred for international games outside of the world cup and euros",Arsenal,Yes,jalrwdy,t1_jalr99r
Can tell he's a child man. Really lacks wider perspective,Arsenal,Yes,jam78ff,t1_jam6dkd
"There was no way he couldn't pull that U turn, Gabriel is clearly elite",Arsenal,Yes,jamkzh9,t1_jam6dkd
Of course. Arguably the two best teams on the planet if you exclude Real.,Arsenal,Yes,jaom7uj,t1_jaok5z8
My bro would go Asda at weird times to try and get it lol. Marketing is crazy man,Arsenal,Yes,japm6vj,t1_japat9e
"Really feel like it is highly possible to get 12 points from the next 4 games (Palhinha out against Fulham is like playing Brighton without Caicedo).  Could be on 72 points with 9 games left by April 1st

Anulo mufa",Arsenal,Yes,jals5zz,t1_jalpibc
"A well-written post with the perfect blend of logical hopium 😍 

up the Arse!!!!",Arsenal,Yes,jalvn77,t1_jalqmo1
"It worked on Øde, maybe it'll work here. Let the kids cook",Arsenal,Yes,jamxnnr,t1_jamnwdc
He is also saying he prefers Italy to the UK soooo,Arsenal,Yes,jamtxqi,t1_jamnwdc
"It worked on Gabriel. Although now that we see it, these things are just catalysts, not determinants.",Arsenal,Yes,jan63e9,t1_jamnwdc
He almost forgot to do it against Leicester until Zinchenko reminded him lol,Arsenal,Yes,japeeht,t1_jap5uno
I started believing on Jan 22 when we beat united on my bday one week after beating spurs away,Arsenal,Yes,jaon47e,t1_jaolz5i
alt. title *All for Nothing*,Arsenal,Yes,jamhzm7,t1_jamg1m0
He belongs at Spurs mate.,Arsenal,Yes,janhqyx,t1_janhbn3
He's exactly where he should be.,Arsenal,Yes,jankp9i,t1_janhbn3
Eric Dier is a player that belongs at that club. Someone like Kane does not.,Arsenal,Yes,janlly7,t1_janhbn3
It's crazy how long he has been at that club 😳,Arsenal,Yes,janis98,t1_janhbn3
"Odegaard was mostly disrespected on Twitter. This sub disrespected him before he officially joined. And its just characteristic of the sub until they see players play.

Most cases we are attached to the resident starters. 

But like more signings and links will show, the coach still thinks this team needs beefing up.",Arsenal,Yes,japmtxw,t1_jap7pb9
What’s the odds?,Arsenal,Yes,jaltcfr,t1_jalsyzl
It’s probably because we are more likely to throw out weakened/roatated teams whereas they will be full strength. Also their draw next round is slightly easier than ours.,Arsenal,Yes,jam19nx,t1_jalsyzl
"It's because when teams open up, the left hand side is a pacey weapon on the counter.

I'd also add that Martinelli works best when playing against a defender running backwards but not as effective against a low block hence why Jesus and now Trossard begin able to swap positions with him is so important to mix things up when playing against a low block.",Arsenal,Yes,jalx4j5,t1_jalvu58
Arteta has probably already lined out how he thinks Rice will fit and how he can improve him while Chelsea are deciding whether to fire their manager or not. I’m confident.,Arsenal,Yes,jamzvd2,t1_jamza3e
Chelsea not setting any groundwork for a signing sounds right up their alley.,Arsenal,Yes,jamzzbc,t1_jamza3e
I remember when he was KFC server pretending to be an ITK. Guy isn't legit.,Arsenal,Yes,jan2rlu,t1_jamza3e
suppose he looks tasty to you then,Arsenal,Yes,janz8vq,t1_janygct
"> camavinga as a backup left back

we're officially back boys",Arsenal,Yes,jaom153,t1_jao902x
Signing Camavinga to play him at LB would be criminal.,Arsenal,Yes,jaohify,t1_jao902x
He could just replace Xhaka lol,Arsenal,Yes,jaoa4z6,t1_jao902x
"I've only seen about 5 Barca games this year but his stats are really, really good.

He's just under performing xG in a similar way to Jesus.",Arsenal,Yes,jaoajxj,t1_jao9mm8
"this is what happens when the pressure is on. and expected from a side that hasn't had the PL trophy in a minute. with time i feel like this gets better. but for now, this is going to be the formality.",Arsenal,Yes,jalpf82,t1_jalmxqr
Nerves.,Arsenal,Yes,jaloj1a,t1_jalmxqr
"I agree. 

Man United game had one of the worst atmospheres in a while for me. Even the pre-match song seemed to go wrong. I normally sit next to the ashburton army section - so lots of juniors which could explain it.

Brentford - had lots of people moaning after 10 minutes. 

My two recent experiences",Arsenal,Yes,jaln2of,t1_jalmxqr
"there are easy games, we played a double pivot of lokonga and AMN vs Watford last year while Tavares was also on the pitch.....",Arsenal,Yes,jamsb59,t1_jamnxk9
"of course no prem game is easy, and i don’t think we’ll rotate, but on paper playing the 19th best team (worst defensively) at home is as easy as it gets …",Arsenal,Yes,jamy53e,t1_jamnxk9
Xhaka was our MOTM in the first half. He was by the best player on the pitch. The goals overshadowed his involvement but he was everywhere in the first half.,Arsenal,Yes,jalndza,t1_jallgpt
"Love them, I always try and get tickets as close to block 25, yet to succeed lol

You can hear the atmosphere they generate through the screen and the players and manager have mentioned multiple times how the better atmosphere has helped them this season.",Arsenal,Yes,jalowin,t1_jalnsiv
"They've been amazing at creating an atmosphere at the Emirates. We needed some (nice) ultras. The Emirates used to B quiet and stale, it's completely different now. I'm glad we've got them, and hopefully they keep on growing!",Arsenal,Yes,jalow1a,t1_jalnsiv
Top lads,Arsenal,Yes,jalpp6q,t1_jalnsiv
Hopefully the relegation dogfight goes right down to the wire too.,Arsenal,Yes,jalut25,t1_jalunvk
Good eye! Very inspiring,Arsenal,Yes,jam5bpa,t1_jam1cxd
"Poor finishing, worse refereeing.",Arsenal,Yes,jam68vx,t1_jam3bn8
Don’t revisit the referee decisions unless you need a few holes punched in your wall,Arsenal,Yes,jam3na1,t1_jam3bn8
jesus couldn't hit a cows arse with a banjo that day,Arsenal,Yes,jam55h3,t1_jam3bn8
Because the ref.,Arsenal,Yes,jam42k9,t1_jam3bn8
Refs.,Arsenal,Yes,jama7xu,t1_jam3bn8
"Poor finishing.

Also, even the Centurions had some questionable results. 

I remember, to make those 100 points, they needed a 90' minute winner to humble 17th placed Southampton. They also drew with Huddersfield. 

Liverpool lost their first game vs relegated Watford in THAT season. In that stretch where they beat Liverpool, they won 1 game in 11. That game was vs Liverpool.",Arsenal,Yes,jam5g22,t1_jam3bn8
"I've never wanted to fuck Geordies so badly in my whole life.

The way they just came to shithouse a point and celebrated like they won…

I want to jizz in their Salad Cream.

Edit: Also their gross pale shirtless fans are unwashed and greasy.",Arsenal,Yes,jan8vtq,t1_jan4krl
De jong in the xhaka position wouldn’t be bad,Arsenal,Yes,jan9u0r,t1_jan8t16
Raphinha 🙏,Arsenal,Yes,jan9lry,t1_jan8t16
what's happening there now??,Arsenal,Yes,janb07u,t1_jan8t16
"Maybe. I can imagine them selling some of Kessie, Raphina and maybe Fati. I also think it’s less likely they’ll buy that young striker they are linked to: Victor Roque. Means we have a better chance.",Arsenal,Yes,jani8z0,t1_jan8t16
Quite obvious we will go back in for Raphinha,Arsenal,Yes,janlhkf,t1_jan8t16
"Martinelli is clear on the left, and we'd play Jesus up top, not at LW.

Trossard is good, and will get rotational minutes.",Arsenal,Yes,jangzlr,t1_jane1au
"The 3 of them are quite similar skillset wise. What they don't have is the outright speed of Martinelli. 

Martinelli gives us a better option in fast breaks and counters.",Arsenal,Yes,jangddp,t1_jane1au
"Martinelli made himself undroppable with the 4 in 3. Manager will have to be so brave to drop him.


However if this happens, Martinelli comes on between 60'-70'.",Arsenal,Yes,janfl3a,t1_jane1au
Martinelli has to start.,Arsenal,Yes,janmbok,t1_jane1au
[teta](https://imgur.com/gallery/3OsITcG),Arsenal,Yes,jao818x,t1_jane1au
Martinelli is the better individual player than Trossard,Arsenal,Yes,jangb07,t1_jane1au
"I don't think we can count Martinelli out. Despite his performance in general play being less-than-peak, he's producing numbers and when Jesus is back I expect it to further improve.",Arsenal,Yes,janekrp,t1_jane1au
"I was thinking yesterday about our opportunities to rest/ rotate when Jesus returns. A front 3 of Jesus/ Eddie/ Trossard is a scary prospect and would arguably be our most clinical front line in front of goal.

The flexibility we have built into our forward line in a short space of time is really impressive.",Arsenal,Yes,janm97v,t1_jane1au
Our best front 3 imo,Arsenal,Yes,jankrle,t1_jane1au
Seems completely achievable when you put it that way,Arsenal,Yes,jaoue38,t1_jaom4kx
"Yeah - I would say as long as the number of points in the grap isn't greater than the games left...e.g 10 points gap with 9 games to go. Then it's a close race.

We focus game by game",Arsenal,Yes,jaq5nde,t1_jappzyv
"Yup, 49 points still up for grabs. Never unclench.",Arsenal,Yes,japs8su,t1_jappzyv
"Jorgi is the best backup dm in the league far and away. I love what he's doing and I want to continue to see him play.

That being said, the starting dm, partey, is just different gravy. Last night he came on and blew everton away, genuinely showed the levels of a top class dm there and then. We show so much more confidence as well with partey in midfield.

If we have partey and Jesus fit for that april run we ain't getting beat I'm convinced",Arsenal,Yes,jals50z,t1_jalru6q
"He wasn't feeling well and Everton is maybe the worst matchup in the league for Jorginho, just athletic runners and nothing else.

Still was fine.",Arsenal,Yes,jalscde,t1_jalru6q
"Especially given the fact Chelsea are in a bit of a financial predicament. They have reiterated that Potter doesn't have to get top 4 this season as it is a ""transition"" season, but that is because they planned on selling Ziyech, RLC, Mendy and Lukaku to the tune of around 100m, which appears as instant profit on their books and offsets no Champions league revenue for a season. But of they sack Potter (which they are under real pressure to do) then they lose that 100m cushion because it costs 60m to sack potter and his staff plus they don't pat Brighton their fee for Potter til this summer and all of a sudden they are down 100m with a wage bill of 230mil, no champs league, 100m in transfers outgoing (purely due to volume of players signed) and a loan of 150m to repay within 5 years. 

No way they are funding 80/90m for Rice",Arsenal,Yes,jalmfp9,t1_jalm2gi
"Chelsea with no CL football should have zero shot of getting him. Not worried about them one bit. Get our future #6, and then find a #8 so we can replace Xhaka",Arsenal,Yes,jalm6e0,t1_jalm2gi
But bro _is_ insanely good looking,Arsenal,Yes,jam70rc,t1_jalztxb
"Started out with Barnet and got back to back promotions off the utter genius that is Catalin Cirjan on loan.

Refused to sign for us though, ended up in Brighton's reserves",Arsenal,Yes,jama1lm,t1_jam6is7
"Been on and off with a Boston United FM22 save. Signed a couple of Arsenal youth players from the ""Teams in Premier League release youth players"" notifcation near the end of every season.

Was able to pick up the likes of James Sweet, Zach Awe, Khayon Edwards, Reull Walters etc.

They helped get me up the leagues to the Championship (where I've been stuck for 4 seasons now - lost the playoff final last season)

While they all have now been sold (for tidy profits), they all helped me out so much getting up the leagues. Very soft spot for those 4 players",Arsenal,Yes,jamhr4c,t1_jam6is7
"I just started my FM career, never played it before, picked it up 2 weeks ago.  
On fifa I always leaned towards arsenal & ex-arsenal players so in the future I most likely will have some stories",Arsenal,Yes,jamno7i,t1_jam6is7
watch on ur phone in ski bar breh,Arsenal,Yes,jan5qdm,t1_jamvkig
Madrid are literally Barca’s bitch. How Barca is so bad in Europe is beyond me.,Arsenal,Yes,jaoqe9m,t1_jaohsln
Might be getting my timelines wrong but Tomas soucek comes to mind. Fell off a cliff recently compared to pandemic ball performances.,Arsenal,Yes,jaolh55,t1_jaol504
[deleted],Arsenal,Yes,jaozdfo,t1_jaoyhtw
"Has my man ever watched Benzema, or any striker for that matter",Arsenal,Yes,jam80t6,t1_jam6u4s
"This take is going around and it's dividing the fanbase in a good way.  

It all stems on the idea that we wanted players like Vlahovic and that Pep decided Jesus was a winger. You need to occupy the central areas because you need someone there for tap-ins/headers.",Arsenal,Yes,jamax9o,t1_jam6u4s
He never saw Henry or Suarez then.,Arsenal,Yes,jamdvyz,t1_jam6u4s
"What the actual fuck lmao

That's a noncething-level shit take.",Arsenal,Yes,jam7ua1,t1_jam6u4s
"Yeah he doesn't know what he's talking about. It's not a case of do or don't. The best players do what they need to do in that moment, using their experience. It's not different from a striker knowing when to drop deep to help his team to win the ball back",Arsenal,Yes,jam828s,t1_jam6u4s
"what a load of crap lmao. did this person never watch, say, Suarez? or Aguero? or Ronaldo Nazario? just making tweets for the hell of it",Arsenal,Yes,jam7q0t,t1_jam6u4s
"Gotta disagree here. Yes we looked a little more fluid, but we also looked dire for 35 minutes yesterday. Saka's goal was our first actual chance and Martinelli's goal was our second. We were bad in the first half and created fuck all. It is only logical that the game opens up when we are up 2-0.

Nketiah did well when he came on yesterday and he would have offered something similar as Trossard did in the second half. 

I'm not shitting on Trossard, I love him and he has been brilliant. I just think Nketiah has been brilliant aswell and doesn't deserve the 'hate' for our lesser performances when the whole team was just underperforming. Somehow it's all been made out as Nketiah's fault and I won't stand for it.",Arsenal,Yes,jalo163,t1_jalnecs
We created nothing for 40 minutes. Goals were well taken and forced Everton out which led to more space 2nd half. I don't see how you can be sure the issue is fixed.,Arsenal,Yes,jalqc7q,t1_jalnecs
The left side was still shite in the first half. We started playing well when Thomas came on,Arsenal,Yes,jalnm71,t1_jalnecs
They're salty that Arteta will match Klopp's PL trophy tally,Arsenal,Yes,jalvn8h,t1_jalvkk7
Because we could do it on our first attempt. They managed it once out of about 5 goes.,Arsenal,Yes,jalvtmg,t1_jalvkk7
"They finished second twice posting 90+ points losing both times to City by only one point on both occasions. 

They hate the fact we could win the league with less than 90 points",Arsenal,Yes,jaly432,t1_jalvkk7
Jealousy,Arsenal,Yes,jalygwy,t1_jalvkk7
"Liverpool fans are always hostile, it's the us ageist the world mentality that they have. It's just the way they have been even before Klopp.",Arsenal,Yes,jalxakz,t1_jalvkk7
I mean I was equally hostile to there's. Fairs fair.,Arsenal,Yes,jalvop9,t1_jalvkk7
Quite shameful that they want this City hegemony to continue.,Arsenal,Yes,jalx7em,t1_jalvkk7
My best guess is that Liverpool fans have more friends that support Arsenal than City...as soon as we were out of the running for the title each season I preferred for City to win also because I know 1 City fan! A fan before the money too..Liverpool and United fans are horrible..so I'd imagine they see it the same way,Arsenal,Yes,jam2xuz,t1_jalvkk7
Same reason we didn't like theirs: it's easier to accept a team with the cheats enabled than one that's just sorted their shit out better.,Arsenal,Yes,jamb3o7,t1_jalvkk7
"""Luck""",Arsenal,Yes,jamjmg0,t1_jame7xi
"The probability of playing 12 home ties in a row in cup games is 0.000244140625. ""Luck"" my ass",Arsenal,Yes,jamluye,t1_jame7xi
"It was a dumb stance. We get that deal for Suarez over the line and we may well have won the league and think about the trajectory it’d put us on. 

Instead Liverpool we’re the ones who rose after that point and we stagnated.",Arsenal,Yes,jaq13dk,t1_japsmgg
"Supposedly, he's been carrying it for some time and just kept playing through it. I think I may have even heard it was an issue even back at City. It's just been managed.

Arsenal just decided to bite the bullet and go for the long-term fix to get it sorted. Similar to Emile's surgery.",Arsenal,Yes,jalqip2,t1_jalqdo6
Yeah. Gotta love how our RB White passed short pass to our LB Zinchenko who played it to our RW Saka while our LW Martinelli was overlapping,Arsenal,Yes,jalu3yn,t1_jalsoub
He’s just a wind up merchant like most of the talkshite lot.,Arsenal,Yes,jam1123,t1_jalz5f1
Really good at his job,Arsenal,Yes,jam10lt,t1_jalz5f1
What has he said now,Arsenal,Yes,jalz8go,t1_jalz5f1
"4 times. 14,15,17,20",Arsenal,Yes,jam5idp,t1_jam585g
"i think the first one went just around his leg, but i may be wrong",Arsenal,Yes,jam6vm8,t1_jam58ox
"Haven't watched them enough to have an opinion, but a reminder that this is the first time these *kids* are playing a full season of men's football. I'd imagine that maintaining consistency is difficult and not surprising that they may be running out of juice a bit",Arsenal,Yes,jamo4g3,t1_jamkklk
"I think we can go toe to toe with our best first team (Partey , Jesus playing). Force City to change how they play, that is honestly how teams have had the most success against City. We've seen that in the CL when Pep tries to gigabrain it. We should be aware though of city using the same tactic again of just lumping it long to Haaland.",Arsenal,Yes,jaor506,t1_jaomit7
I think the game at the Eithad is a whole new prospect with Gabi and Thomas Partey there. That is if it is our best starting 11 being available.,Arsenal,Yes,jaoy7mi,t1_jaomit7

But the race is closer than it looks. ManUre, peaking their nose, yes they are in the title race, Man Shitty probably will try to cheat out one last time. Every game will impact the title race for the top 3. 

Back after many years I've started watching Arsenal games again, Saturday early games are around 4:30 am, I've been watching those as well. And now I don't care if we win or not, Of course I would love us to win but then the team, the way we have been playing, the whole atmosphere and vibe is making me watch Arsenal matches again and I love that feeling.

"That is some next level copium... financially sure, Champions League is important for Spurs (and I'm still not convinced they'll be 4th at the season's end) but Spurs are the laughing stock of English football because they walk around as if they are a top club, but they haven't won a major trophy in decades. No one can begin to tell me that Spurs wouldn't have been jizzing left and right to lift an FA Cup this season, besides the fact that Kane will be out the door soon because Tottenham can't win anything and he doesn't want to end his career with no trophies.",Arsenal,Yes,jam8e3j,t1_jam6crx

"I think Caceido would have had a great impact. He is a more like-for-like sub to Partey. 

However I disagree with a lot of people on here that Mudryk’s lack of success at Chelsea so far is simply because of poor coaching. He has a lot of bad attributes that will need a lot of work over time.

His first touch is poor, he loses the ball too easily  and his finishing isn’t great. He definitely would not have had the instant impact Trossard have had.",Arsenal,Yes,jalpzx8,t1_jalndkw

"Liverpool are getting at least a point off United but I’m not worried about them at all they are irrelevant here.


Newcastle look mentally cooked, I can kinda see them conceding early and the game being a formality but City are playing them at the best possible time which i guess is fair considering we’ve been decently lucky so far this season to play teams when they’re missing key players",Arsenal,Yes,jallwv2,t1_jallp77
"We face Bournemouth at the Emirates.

You're looking for perfect weekend and you won't get a better one.",Arsenal,Yes,jalr9wu,t1_jallp77
The heat maps of Martinelli and Trossard were identical. Swapping and changing all game made it tough for Everton defenders to keep shape. Jesus was doing the same thing when he was fit.,Arsenal,Yes,jalnj0r,t1_jaln0f2

"how does Saka do what he is currently doing man? 

this guy is so young yet is literally Arsenals best player. that goal yesterday was so so so impressive. not just because of how he took it, turned and shot. but because of how important it was in the moment - we were struggling to get can shots and yet the faker Saka found a way. just insane that guy",Arsenal,Yes,jalvpvb,t1_jalts3x

"Southampton, Bournemouth, Everton",Arsenal,Yes,jan62lq,t1_jan2bcg
"Lads... *Vieira was not a DM*.

He played with Petit and Gilberto as Dm's next to him.

Paddy is the single greatest all round central midfielder I ahve ever seen. Imagine a cross between Partey and Fabregas and you'd get the idea.

The closest player to get to Vieira in promise was Diaby and on the pitch was Yaya Toure.",Arsenal,Yes,jao0c46,t1_jany2nl
"To follow on the very good replies you've already enjoyed...

In comparing them, you really do have to bear in mind the differences in their roles. Vieira was a true CM who played with a lot of freedom and a more defensive midfield partner; Thomas plays as a lone 6 who is more a CM than a DM strictly speaking, but still performs more of the functions of a true DM than Vieira ever did.

Beyond that, imagine if Thomas was the size of Saliba, but with technical facility and ability in the final third closer to ESR (to use contemporary examples). Thomas can do some incredible things on the ball, but Vieira was just on another level. A man that big and powerful should not be able to do what he could with such fluency.

To my mind, Paddy was a superior midfielder, but I'm not sure he would have enjoyed our 6 role much. Thomas is 'merely' a world-class 6, possibly *the* best in the world right now, and one of the very best central midfielders we've had at this club; Vieira was one of the best midfielders ever to play in England.",Arsenal,Yes,jao5j1n,t1_jany2nl
"Vieira was better in most aspects of his game but not by huge margins but Vieira was a better player by a far way overall. Vieira is the best player I’ve seen at Arsenal and Partey isn’t quite up there.


Partey does have great ability to take a ball on a half turn and beat two guys in a instant with quick feet and smooth hips but Vieira was brilliant at this as well.
I give Partey credit I think he is brilliant and his ‘disguised’ passing where he looks for all the world like he is passing to x and he pulls it to y is something Vieira didn’t have in his locker.


Vieira was more aggressive, quicker, better dribbler, better in both boxes from set pieces, better through balls, more skillful, braver, gutsy etc

Partey might pip Patrick on anticipation it’s uncanny the amount of times Parety intercepts the ball but again Vieira was wonderful at this as well.

I love watching Partey glide around the pitch he is a very special and talented player. 

If we win the league Partey will be the best midfielder to have won it for us ever after Vieira. I think he is that good. A level above Davis, Gilberto, Thomas, Storey, Edu and even Petit.",Arsenal,Yes,jao3d3t,t1_jany2nl
"Let's hope he has a few more, Madrid gets Jude and we get another midfield star from madrid",Arsenal,Yes,jao1jyd,t1_jao05h5
Wouldn’t mind seeing Vieira get a start tbh.,Arsenal,Yes,jao80t7,t1_jao71yl
Can we give Saka some rest? I'd prefer Trossard on the right over Martinelli.,Arsenal,Yes,jao85t1,t1_jao71yl

"They have world class players at  key positions in their prime who bail them out even though their overall play and structure is not elite.
They have a lot of players who are elite in the final third and all are on form right now.
Rashford, Bruno, Antony and now Sancho and garnacho.
Scoring just comes easy to them right now.
It takes the pressure off the mistakes from the rest of the team.

Arsenal rely more on their overall team play and structure to generate scoring chances. It gives us more consistency, but we lose momentum whenever we rotate our starters.",Arsenal,Yes,jan2b6r,t1_jamsk6v
Nothing. Corruption is everywhere,Arsenal,Yes,jao7asc,t1_jao6vcr

Seems like a non story. How is anyone gonna prove anything in Saudi Arabia. They literally killed a journalist in Turkey and nothing happened,Arsenal,Yes,jao8bv7,t1_jao6vcr
"nothing will happen, nothnig new really came out. The PIF is a soverign wealth fund, of course it is controlled/owned by the Saudi government, that's what a SWF is. So not sure what this admission really shows unless the people that run the PL are the most naive people on earth. At least when its like the Qatari Crown prince's brother or whatever there's the slightest bit of deniability that its not government controlled, but the PIF is just owned by the government, that's not a secret or anything or even nefarious in anyway, its just what it is.",Arsenal,Yes,jaoeijh,t1_jao6vcr
"Our pressing won't be the same for every team. Against a team like Brentford, you won't force the ball to Raya as much.

Against Spurs and United, you love when the ball goes back to their goalkeepers.

Romero is a hard tackle merchant,Arsenal,Yes,jalxc70,t1_jalwxua

"Well we all saw KT tried to adapt, which is a very good sign. But we have yet to see he doing an underlap mixing with overlap like White does, which will help our course. Crossing is useless unless it ended with an attempt at goal, it's the same with a cut back or a passing. The trouble is we have a 5'8 Trossard against Everton's 6'4 CBs, if u think the odd is good then I have nothing to say.",Arsenal,Yes,jalouzy,t1_jalo8a0
People still don't understand low crosses amd cutbacks exist apparently.,Arsenal,Yes,jalq7b1,t1_jalo8a0
U might be right but it’s a huge positive for us that we have that choice,Arsenal,Yes,jamuali,t1_jamsm39
"KT should stay, he was monumental in our previous seasons. Players do get injured, and we should have plenty of games had we not exit FA cup and Carabao cup early. Next season we will even have tougher fixtures with CL. KT should definitely stay.",Arsenal,Yes,jan1scl,t1_jamsm39

More than just a chance.,Arsenal,Yes,jaomf6i,t1_jaocbyt
"Fulham I'm not sure, Liverpool at the back at a mess. I think they'll try raise intensity though again and we'll need to be prepared for that. If we can win the midfield, I think our forwards tear their backline apart. Newcastle I'm hoping just continue to drift off to the point they actually need to try and beat us to make CL. They can't just try to terrorball their way to a 0-0 again.",Arsenal,Yes,jaorh9r,t1_jaocbyt
"Chelsea at home for me. I know, I know. But for a while now I've been feeling an upset. Every star has aligned for us to smash them.

Also City. Now that we lost at home we must win there. We had two good first halves, but in the second couldn't react to Pep's changes. Hopefully Arteta learned from those otherwise we're toast.

Anfield is Anfield.",Arsenal,Yes,jaqeiya,t1_jaocbyt

Xhaka or Ødegaard. With Jesus and Nelson back we're stacked in the front three.,Arsenal,Yes,jallsiy,t1_jall8xp
Emile got roughly 10 minutes on the pitch so not a lot of time to shine. He was doing 1-2’s and making nice looking runs but not getting the overhead/through ball to him. He looked comfortable on the ball but last night was just a formality to get him back into the rhythm I think. Definitely looking forward to having our #10 as an option again.,Arsenal,Yes,jalqezv,t1_jalp5i8
"Don't fix if it's working. My only change would be Partey starting.

"Thomas could play 90, but he also clearly, on the strength of yesterday, doesn't need the minutes for sharpness. He's there already.

I'd start Jorginho; it's Bournemouth, and part of the reason we got him was so Thomas could put his feet up in these situations, and save himself for stronger competition.",Arsenal,Yes,jam34jh,t1_jam0vqp
"I'd like Vieira, Tomi, and KT to get significant minutes.  It's unrealistic to expect these guys to be 100% off the blocks in the EL if they don't have a run in.",Arsenal,Yes,jam2gus,t1_jam0vqp

"He's gonna go to Liverpool if he goes anywhere imo. He'll go from being hated at Chelsea for not being the 2nd coming of Frank to being hated at Liverpool for not being Jude Bellingham. Tough scene, ngl.",Arsenal,Yes,jan5rha,t1_jamvoze
Could be onto something. People was saying no to rashford when he was being linked to us and even United fans where saying sell him.,Arsenal,Yes,jamzrbx,t1_jamvoze
"I wouldn't mind getting him at all. He's better than Fabio and ESR at the moment. He's only 24 and he's already won Chelsea player of the year twice. He's clearly shown he can do it at the highest stage. He's out of form and in typical Chelsea fashion, he's been scapegoated for their struggles as they are all about their shiny new toys.

The problem is he will not start over Odegaard and I doubt he wants to rotate. The idea of ESR going on to become that player himself is a lot more exciting too.",Arsenal,Yes,janeobl,t1_jamvoze
Kimmich is probably the only other fullback in the world who can excel as a midfielder.,Arsenal,Yes,jallth5,t1_jallqc6

 I think we keep them both until the end of 2023/24",Arsenal,Yes,jalvbsu,t1_jalrmpx
"I think we should probably sell Balo for a good fee, don't think he's a better player than Nketiah",Arsenal,Yes,jalsyui,t1_jalrmpx

"Their ownership is a gigantic, gigantic mess.

They have a big fanbase and are a big club historically.

"He's out for 6 months and he was NEVER a starter when fit.

"Saying that City will win the title is a reasonable take - the issue with Neville is that he never says anything nice about Arsenal, even when he does it with a caveat - he clearly hates us.

Yeah I think the best use of Martinelli is him rotating with one of the wingers/striker and coming centrally more often. His movement in the box is very promising, always has been.",Arsenal,Yes,jalqv87,t1_jalp5x7
"agreed, martinelli played up front more than trossard did yesterday imo. what people meant when they said martinelli is missing jesus is that he missed the rotation of left wing and striker, not necessarily that jesus is the one making him play well",Arsenal,Yes,jalr8a3,t1_jalp5x7

He looks short on confidence. His decision making in the final third has fallen off of a cliff lately,Arsenal,Yes,janjsoz,t1_jan3bz7
"I see what you’re saying. May be it’s because of our system, players know where their team mates are and if they’re in a position to cover/ tackle. So they know that even if they let a player past them at that point, they are still in control. So their decision making has improved from the sense that they are not rushing into silly fouls and tackles. Eg: Yesterday, Partey was closed down after the 4th goal but he was aware that Big Gabi was behind him so he just fell (of course drew the foul).",Arsenal,Yes,janymxg,t1_jan3bz7
"Get a grip. Nothing was off about his game, he played very well, worked hard to track back and made a lot of tackles. 

Watching highlights that only show chances created by Everton and not all the times he did the defensive work is not a fair representation of his performance.",Arsenal,Yes,jan6e96,t1_jan3bz7
"Frontline takes turns getting hot. Odegaard was unstoppable for a while, Saka carried us while Martinelli struggled, Eddie did his part as well. Jesus will score a few for sure.",Arsenal,Yes,jamdf0u,t1_jambsz6

People were saying stuff like ""Buy Raphinha to be Saka back up"". Like, who do you think you are to have Raphinha waiting for 20 minute cameos. 

So, Tierney wants to move. Next up could be Tomi. 

Players like Kiwior and Holding won't because that's just what depth usually is for clubs like ours. Even that isn't a safe bet as Lokonga tried to leave.",Arsenal,Yes,japnfw7,t1_jap1he7
"If you’re talking about stars aligning, it has to be Leeds 0-1 Arsenal. We didn’t create much, Leeds missed sitters, missed a penalty, heroic defending from Gabriel. THAT was a game only champions can win.",Arsenal,Yes,jam4ws4,t1_jam4cy0

"> in the mould of Zinchenko

This is much easier said than done.  If Zinchenko represents some kind of archetype, then we would need to convert a midfielder.  Buy Zubimendi and play him at RB would be as close as you'd get.  Alternatively, play Thomas as a RB (he's done it before).  

If you are looking for a fullback in the mould of Zinchenko, you aren't looking for a fullback.",Arsenal,Yes,jantdtf,t1_janpp4y
"Tomi has to play CB, he’s an easy pressing trigger when he’s at full back (plus he’s a good CB). Fresneda will be the RB brought in. I think Zinny, Tavares on his last chance (an overlapping FB option is a must imo), sousa and Kiwior (I think he could do it) is enough for LB.

Rice is a must buy for me. Super athlete. With his ability to cover large spaces as the 6 we can afford to play a 10 profile in the LCM role, Fabio V is growing every game. I’m of the same opinion of Xhaka, think we’d miss his duel winning and engine. Caicedo is probably the happy medium of retaining some of Xhaka’s defensive contributions but adding far superior turning radius, technical ability, ability to receive  ahead of the ball. Signing an 8 is a lower priority for me unless there’s a can’t miss market opportunity (Bellingham is the one but it’ll never happen). Patino will break through soon, Lewis-Skelly looks special & if Nwaneri stays that’s a lot of players in and around that role. 

I don’t think we explicitly need a RW. Jesus & Trossard can both play there so a LW isn’t out of the question. Leao being the obvious one. I think Balogun being sold with a buy back clause is what will happen, I’ve not seen enough of him to pick between him & Nketiah (I’m very happy with Eddie as the backup option). I wouldn’t buy a ST as there’s a few in the Hale end pipeline plus Martinelli is destined for a move to the centre.",Arsenal,Yes,janwp89,t1_janpp4y
Fans like you are unbelievable. Odegaard makes this team tick and with his relentless pressing hes undroppable. You guys wants us to dominate games like we are playing u18s what morw do you want from him? He gets double teamed every time he gets the ball and btw teams are playing low block against us every single time theres literally no space to pass into even KDB struggles against teama like Everton.,Arsenal,Yes,jaln07g,t1_jallhsb
There are not many things u could do if opponents double or sometimes triple up on u in the first 45 minutes. All he need is a lapse in concentration.,Arsenal,Yes,jalm0lh,t1_jallhsb

Allison > Raya,Arsenal,Yes,jam39rc,t1_jam2rc2
"I'd definitely take Thomas over Casemiro, and I'd have to agree with those arguing for Alisson over Raya.

I think Martinelli has genuinely been better than Rashford all season; even with Rashford's crazy run of form and Martinelli being nailed to the sideline on our stagnating left, he could well end up with more PL goals than Rashford this season, and he does so much more for us. That said, I would have to acknowledge my heart was holding some sway in this.

I do love, though, how including Martinez beside Zinchenko vindicates both our interest in Martinez and our decision to go with Zinchenko. Martinez would have given us a very balanced backline with him and White as our FBs; Zinchenko is an animal so different he's almost unique.",Arsenal,Yes,jam97l4,t1_jam2rc2

"We had cheap smart signings under Wenger given where we used to finish, and also relative to what our immediate rivals used to spend. Matter fact, that was his superpower. His most expensive purchase was Mesut Ozil( Auba started the Raul era).

They still have to play Liverpool. Newcastle this weekend although they've fallen off recently so not sure they'll do us any favours and game week 38 they go to Brentford where we could see them drop points again. Definitely doable for city to drop 6 points.,Arsenal,Yes,jao9zw6,t1_jao6quu

"No way bro. We don't underestimate any teams in this league, every game we play should have the strongest most capable 11 available to win us the game.

"Burn out?

He got his rest yesterday and he'll probably take it easy the next few games at home Vs not very good opposition but it's part of his job as a world class player to play 50 games a season. 

Arteta keeps telling us this as well. And still we are like ""when can we rest him?""

I dunno why it's taking so long for people to understand this. 

Furthermore I don't think there's any evidence that playing lots of games can burn out someone's career. 

It's just something we like to say.

Guess I find it most tough seeing United succeed, purely because their support is so ubiquitous that it's impossible to avoid...

"They're making a big push to get in the game, so it makes sense to try and keep a top young talent. About a decade ago in North America the same happened with Under Armour. They signed the best young athletes in their sports; Cam Newton (NFL) Jordan Spieth (PGA) Bryce Harper (MLB) and Steph Curry (Steph Curry) Without those moves they're bankrupt by now. I hope they throw Saka an absolute bag, but I'd love to see him in a Nike ad

Sorry, that was a lot",Arsenal,Yes,jan45af,t1_jan0k6h
Rivaldo famously stuck with Mizuno so he wouldn't be the first to stay with his first big company,Arsenal,Yes,jan0zdq,t1_jan0k6h

"I could see Flo getting another loan at at CL level team. Don't think we'll sell Eddie one year after his extension if mad money isn't offered.

Or Boehly drops 250 on Flo, wouldn't put it past him.",Arsenal,Yes,jalkohi,t1_jalkf1i
"Flo definitely loan next season, probably a Europa league team where he is a starter. He need to play consistently.",Arsenal,Yes,jall0jg,t1_jalkf1i
Keep all 3. All can play wide. We should use the 352 shape more.,Arsenal,Yes,jalkvi7,t1_jalkf1i
A four nil win showed that we need to do better?,Arsenal,Yes,janf7uq,t1_jan7c0a
"We broke through in 40mins.

That's good when a match still has 50mins to play....

What are you on about?",Arsenal,Yes,jan8oe7,t1_jan7c0a
">some teams don't lose that concentration or other days we aren't at our best which is where we need to punish them more.

Any team that can do that for 90 minutes isn't being beat. City and Liverpool didn't break through with systematic beat downs each time, they spend money on players who can pull something out of their ass in desperate times and just have the mentality to keep pushing til they grab a winner.

Liverpool have had their keeper score to earn points, City basically won a league thanks to a 30 yard screamer from their CB. We've shown that we can break down buses because we've won so many games against them this season.",Arsenal,Yes,janaqm0,t1_jan7c0a
"Most teams also don’t set up in a 4-5-1 like Everton do under Dyche. Yh the first 40 minutes were a bit meh, but most teams have set up in a deep block against us this season and we’ve broke them down most of the time

The way we moved around our front 3 plus our midfielders all pushing up into different areas made Everton confused. Plus Newcastle who play similarly to Everton will be more expansive at home when we play them later",Arsenal,Yes,janc3n0,t1_jan7c0a
"When you’re at the top, you have to constantly adapt to new tactics from opposing managers. We’re slowly getting the hang of playing against disciplined defenses that target our dangerous wingers. The first goal was a perfect illustration of players rotating to overload one side and creating a gap for Zinchenko to find Saka in behind. We need more of that and I’m sure this is being worked on in training. The important thing is to get the belief back to where it was and I think yesterday helped massively to get over the game at Goodison Park.",Arsenal,Yes,jancytx,t1_jan7c0a
17 wins we’ve done ok this season. Yes not perfect but it’s not like teams have figured us out.,Arsenal,Yes,jan7yko,t1_jan7c0a
Vieira has earned a start for sure would like to see him at the #8 spot and start Partey as well,Arsenal,Yes,jalkrjw,t1_jalkhfj
Partey and Vieira should come in.,Arsenal,Yes,jalknh9,t1_jalkhfj
"It was lively at first but then you could sense the tension. In the second half, it was a party atmosphere.

There seemed to be a lot of empty seats, at least in the lower level, was that the case?",Arsenal,Yes,jalmytc,t1_jalmbkc
"I hear that Sporting employs the same annoying low block as Everton. Want to see our subs play this tie, they need to show they can overcome a challenge like that",Arsenal,Yes,jalsvzx,t1_jalspem
"They are currently 4th five points behind Braga, so it has been pretty bad season for them so far.",Arsenal,Yes,jalu0z6,t1_jalspem
Seems like either Heart-thRob Holding or Kiwior based on last night's bench.,Arsenal,Yes,janq6i5,t1_janp0dg

Either Kiwi or Holding,Arsenal,Yes,janqa92,t1_janp0dg
"Now that I think of this, Chelsea are that insane. 

It would take a flashier LW being available for them to try and edit Mudryk out of the XI. Then because of the price tag, they would try to force him into the team in a position that's just not for him...like say, LWB.",Arsenal,Yes,jalo1sv,t1_jaln75y
"I guess they might wait to see how he is with another coach before making a decision on him, if Potter gets the sack. It's too soon to write him off.",Arsenal,Yes,jalngzq,t1_jaln75y

Pretty sure there were Perisic / Zinchenko debates as well lol,Arsenal,Yes,jam7vc8,t1_jam181s
I agree we’re gunning for the title and that is the aim. But on the other hand I don’t think it’s wrong to say if we come second that’s not failure.,Arsenal,Yes,jam06vd,t1_jalvfdr
That's me literally. Started S1 in 17/18 and graduating S6 in 3 months. At least I'll have something to celebrate when I leave.,Arsenal,Yes,jampiih,t1_jam4jl6
"Holy shit you're right. Our last CL game against Bayern I was 11 and in year 6. Now I'm in year 12 and learning to drive, assuming we qualify I'll be in year 13 and maybe with a driving licence when we play our first game back. Crazy to think about.",Arsenal,Yes,janag8g,t1_jam4jl6
Pope can have a clean sheet on that game. I really wouldn't mind that at all to be honest.,Arsenal,Yes,jam2e9a,t1_jalz0ro
"I can see where they’re coming from though, both of those had raw attributes similar to Martinelli, Walcott probably didn’t have the drive or mentality but Ox had huge potential and could have been world class imo. Injuries were obviously mostly to blame for his career trajectory but I also think he would have been much better under Arteta than he was under Wenger.

He had an elite combination of pace and strength with a powerful shot and very good technique. He struggled a lot with decision making (just like Martinelli used to), and Wengers “express yourself” mantra really isn’t beneficial to those types of players. If he was drilled into Artetas system I think we could have had a real player there",Arsenal,Yes,jamt4yc,t1_jampbjy
"That’s just crazy tbh. People still call him doginelli too which is not only childish, but incredibly disrespectful given his performances recently.",Arsenal,Yes,jan0iam,t1_jamrj1r
They all think that Simple Jack lookin mf'er is the best young player in the world lmao,Arsenal,Yes,jannow8,t1_jannfee
Them thinking their CBs are better than our CBs pisses me off more than it should.,Arsenal,Yes,janywqp,t1_jannfee
foden fc have also been very insufferable,Arsenal,Yes,jant3kr,t1_jannfee

Pretty good ngl,Arsenal,Yes,jamil9b,t1_jamakmw
"I've never witnessed a left back like zinny before. He is a complete rarity, I am beyond dumbfounded at why city let him go for just 35m. Especially since they are now struggling with their left back situation",Arsenal,Yes,jaorhi8,t1_jaopooj

Pundits love a good ol' United bootlick. Big market segment. Hilariously overblown takes after beating the worst Barca team in >20 years... in EL.,Arsenal,Yes,janoi1a,t1_janj72t
"I feel like the biggest asset we have is that we have shown uniform development across all of our young talent on a consistent basis, and these players still have some clear deficiencies that they only seem closed to ironing out as well. And then we have squad deficiencies and still a fairly small squad which has room for additions, which we have been very consistent with in recruiting quality. Things look exceptionally positive for us.",Arsenal,Yes,jann593,t1_janlx95
Does he thrive in a possession system? He can't trap a ball. Tournament football is a completely different game to club football,Arsenal,Yes,jalrn2y,t1_jalrk60
"Exactly, no reason we can’t score an extra 2 with our bench is there!",Arsenal,Yes,jalzkps,t1_jalz1ze
Their 60m striker with 0 league goals in March is absolutely hilarious,Arsenal,Yes,jalxt1c,t1_jaltw1j
We are such a lucky club/fans to have rivals that continuously shit the bed and are known as the meme/banter club of the EPL. Never change Tottenham Hotspurs 😭,Arsenal,Yes,jaluxhd,t1_jaltw1j
"I have thought that he presents several opportunities for balls over the top which our midfield rarely bites at. Then, in yesterday's post-match Arteta mentioned how Martinelli and Vieira have a great connection and that they will be playing together soon... can... not... wait!",Arsenal,Yes,jam9uud,t1_jam8ibh
The Martinelli hate recently has just been embarrassing tbh,Arsenal,Yes,jam8pko,t1_jam8ibh
"I think this team has to be the best just because of the defense/GK.

Ramsdale vs Almunia is just a gigantic difference.

No Gallas or Vermaelen is also just so big. They were just liabilities we don't have.",Arsenal,Yes,japxfev,t1_japsyqw
Very top.,Arsenal,Yes,jalkpv1,t1_jalk8i0
"If anything, Liverpool has just started to pick their form back, at least in league games.",Arsenal,Yes,jam0h90,t1_jam0619
"Palace have picked up points in some difficult games recently, check their last 6 or so games, it was a very tough stretch",Arsenal,Yes,jam4stq,t1_jam0619
why isn't it?  It's not like anyone in Europe is miles better than us and we mostly have the depth to cope now plus any new faces in the summer....  If our aim isn't to win it then who are we scared of?,Arsenal,Yes,jampytw,t1_jam7cuz
"Correct. Almost no-one comes out of nowhere to win it first go (or rather first go in a while). Last team I can think of to do so was Mourinho's Porto almost 20 years previously, and they'd won Europa the year before.

I'd be satisfied with quarter finals. Any further is a bonus.",Arsenal,Yes,jamgixl,t1_jam7cuz

"He had some big dreams but I feel like Liverpool, we can have our big players hooked.",Arsenal,Yes,jalr4rz,t1_jalmj99
"I never felt like we'd do it in 13/14. We had City/Chelsea breathing down our necks all season and Ramsey, who was in the form of his life, couldn't stay fit. Our collapse was inevitable. I'll be devastated if we don't win it this time.",Arsenal,Yes,jan2ndt,t1_jan16pz
"This exactly, the ""Bogey"" factor, I remember palace being 2 goals up at ht at the Etihad before being blown away by a Haaland hattrick earlier this season",Arsenal,Yes,jalm6an,t1_jallv9s
Nah Drawcastle will do what they do best against City… Draw. I call them the football artists of the premier league since they love drawing so much.,Arsenal,Yes,jalnktw,t1_jalmlli

I started believing after we beat Chelsea... In Orlando.,Arsenal,Yes,jaozhnr,t1_jaon47e
"That United game was incredible. Nobody’s hotter than United since the World Cup break and yet I never believed for a second—even when we went down 0-1 and 1-2–that we would lose or even tie.

"no, we are saving that title for kane’s biopic",Arsenal,Yes,jamkkv8,t1_jamhzm7
It feels like he is their Almunia. Inexplicably he is still playing and still costing them points years after it was painfully clear he isn’t up to it.,Arsenal,Yes,janlfha,t1_janis98
"I couldn't believe we were able to sign Odegaard. If anyone in 2019 told you we would, it would shock you.

But he has improved a ton with us. It was never a certainty he would do so.",Arsenal,Yes,japxo79,t1_japmtxw
"At the book I predominantly use United are 3.5, Arsenal 4, Juve 8.",Arsenal,Yes,jaltk2d,t1_jaltcfr
"A lot of players could replace Xhaka, but not very many could replace Zinny and his unique role, that’s why I specified that position.",Arsenal,Yes,jaoc7ak,t1_jaoa4z6
"Exactly. I remember in the first half of the season, fans wouldn’t stop singing even when we were losing. The reaction to that Saliba own goal comes to mind.

With the expectation of winning the league now, the atmosphere has become really tense. Everyone is talking about the atmosphere last night, but it was comparatively quiet up until the first goal.",Arsenal,Yes,jalncox,t1_jaln2of

Would be an interesting decision to drop our top goal scorer…,Arsenal,Yes,jann0ft,t1_janmbok
"Disagree, they both have different qualities. Trossard has better ball control, decision making (football iq), long shot, left foot, passing range and versatility. Martinelli is faster, probably slightly better finisher, more direct, better header.

Imo trossard at this age is a better overall player, but martinelli is still so young so time will tell if he becomes a worldbeater.",Arsenal,Yes,janizo2,t1_jangb07
Trossard has 100x the technical ability of Martinelli,Arsenal,Yes,jani14q,t1_jangb07
"Not counting him out whatsoever - just curious how others see Jesus, Trossard & Saka working together. We already know how good Jesus & Martinelli pairing is; I think Jesus & Trossard would also be lethal. Our current options for the left wing are insane. It's like choosing between champagne and caviar lmao",Arsenal,Yes,janibd3,t1_janekrp
*39,Arsenal,Yes,japxz5n,t1_japs8su
"Good move pouncing on those released players. I've had Reuell Walters before, love me a good fullback. I try to focus on our academy players as well, don't know if I could live with myself if I signed like, Saliba or even Reiss.

Half the time I just use the editor to keep topping up Saka's contract and making him dislike teams like City or PSG (which inevitably go in for him on every single one of my saves).",Arsenal,Yes,jamjvao,t1_jamhr4c
"Doesn't have to be the striker. Doesn't have to be the same player each attack either. This is what I mean about knowing and understanding the principles of positonal play.

In Peps times he's used Messi F9, Henry, Etoo, Villa wide, Haaland as a poacher, Foden Sterling etc as wide/backpost poachers.

ETH same principles has used big target men like Weghorst and Haller, F9s like Tadic and Rashy who's a versatile forward who will drift wide.

 https://imgur.com/8FICDDg.jpg

As long as you understand and follow that you can tweak and vary your game dependent on player strengths and mismatches you wanna emphasise

EDIT - I think it's Jesus scoring that meant he was pushed wide. Didn't handle the pressure well but has grown since.",Arsenal,Yes,jamfp6y,t1_jamax9o
People on this sub swear by this account too,Arsenal,Yes,jam7rz7,t1_jam7q0t
"But Saka's goal came from Martinelli and Zinchenko coming over to the right. Look at this [screenshot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqLDCY_WcAEf5Rw?format=jpg&name=large) and see how Everton were static and in the same shape and how our guys rotating from the other side created chaos and opened up space. It's quite funny how all of Trossard, Odegaard, Saka and Martinelli are asking for the ball.",Arsenal,Yes,jalpiys,t1_jalo163
"I don't think either of you are wrong, but I will agree on the fact that with Trossard's play through the middle, Martinelli finally has sparked some of his old form back. Against low block teams, playing Eddie isn't quite the answer, but when the games more open (like the second half of Everton) I like having the option to bring on Eddie when needed.",Arsenal,Yes,jaloyer,t1_jalo163
"U must understand critism doesn't mean 'hate'. Nketiah is our boy why should we hate him? It's clear we want him to add something to his game which is lacking at the moment. He has to earn his place just like every others, this is a brutal business only fittest survives.",Arsenal,Yes,jalpkhu,t1_jalo163
"Wrong. We were probing non stop. Once we connect one final ball we opened up the game. Everton was forced to come forward, that's make our life much easier.",Arsenal,Yes,jalnqsp,t1_jalnm71
I mean we were shite in general first 40 minutes.,Arsenal,Yes,jalnqkh,t1_jalnm71
"Yup I only have one liverpool friend who’s a serious fan and damn he was so annoying about it. Cheered for man city all the way

Sad the way man city got all their players/money since it directly affected us. But my friends annoying attitude towards liverpool and me and my friends team (newcastle for the friend) made us want to see liverpool lose. Now what a season it’s been for our dynamic",Arsenal,Yes,jamcjxa,t1_jam2xuz
"Thanks for the reply, wasn't fully sure what the story was.",Arsenal,Yes,jalqot9,t1_jalqip2

"Tottenham is currently the bar to reach 4th as they have the 5th best potential points in the league. They can reach 84 maximum.

Getting to 85 is 25 points from the remaining 39, 8 wins and a draw.

To not do that whilst in a title race would yeah be a monster collapse",Arsenal,Yes,jalt2a1,t1_jalspls
Already on it lol,Arsenal,Yes,janwvqn,t1_janwk23
"People tend to forget how ferociously we came out that second half against Brum after the horror injury and being down at halftime.

After putting in an incredibly gutsy performance the ref gave them a very soft penalty in injury time.

We got fucked by refs that whole season.",Arsenal,Yes,jao41pe,t1_janyu1n
"My hottest take was that Martinelli would be better than Son this year.
Said that in here in August.",Arsenal,Yes,jao51n0,t1_jannccx

You can clearly see how different the attack is with a false 9 Trossard. This is the type of striker Martinelli feeds with Eddie is a poacher which doesn't unlock Gabi's game,Arsenal,Yes,janrlub,t1_janqtu4

We have Lewis-Skelly at home,Arsenal,Yes,jao1ve0,t1_jao1jyd
Yeah I feel Xhaka could do with a rest. Bournemouth might be the sort of side we can afford to play someone a bit more lightweight like Vieira in that role. Also wouldn't mind Tomi getting a run over White.,Arsenal,Yes,jao9j56,t1_jao80t7
Saka a rest? My FPL says otherwise lmao. I was thinking Xhaka could do with a rest. I like the idea of starting Partey and Jorginho or giving Vieira more minutes.,Arsenal,Yes,jao94j7,t1_jao85t1

"so your problem with tierney is he doesn't underlap? if that's all it is then there's no problem at all he can be told to underlap

i don't even know what to say to that tbh

> The trouble is we have a 5'8 Trossard against Everton's 6'4 CBs

we don't play everton every week and trossard isn't our striker every week. plus who says you have to cross to the striker anyway being marked by big cbs? trent and robertson cross all the time and for years liverpool didn't have anyone in their front line over 6ft",Arsenal,Yes,jalpfko,t1_jalouzy
Yeah love to Tierney does that. Rare I must say.,Arsenal,Yes,jalqwqe,t1_jalq7b1
we scored 2 yesterday from cut backs down the left so i can't understand how people think our best left footed crosser of the ball wouldn't be a fit there,Arsenal,Yes,jalqqih,t1_jalq7b1
With our performance against them at home? I am not too worried if we have Jesus back.,Arsenal,Yes,jaomi09,t1_jaom9av
"Agree 100%, except I would go even harder on the rotation for Lisbon, especially the first leg. Tierney, Tomiyasu, Vieira, Eddie, ESR, Jorginho, Holding, Turner and potentially even Kiwior starting, only Saka and one of Odegaard/Xhaka from the regular 11. 

Let's see what we actually have in these players, keep the regular starters on the bench in case of emergency but that squad should be good enough to at least get a draw against Sporting.",Arsenal,Yes,jam2x5r,t1_jam1dgf
He would go into Xhaka’s role with ease,Arsenal,Yes,jan2w0r,t1_jamzwrt
Would take some convincing. Zinchenko had KDB Bilva Silva Gundogan all ahead. Then Foden as well.,Arsenal,Yes,jalm7cg,t1_jalm26q

Isn’t Mpabbe French? Born and raised Bondy so more than 3-4,Arsenal,Yes,janj2wp,t1_jana5gw

probably because the lion's share of his football development took place in Spain  with Real Sociedad. I know some of you transfer saga OG's remember the links to us back in the day when he was still there in San Sebastián.,Arsenal,Yes,janmqey,t1_janf280

Specifically, that both of Martinelli's goals *and* Saka's goal involved him operating as a striker, and in the latter (first) case, skewing so far right that he was outside Saka.",Arsenal,Yes,jam20da,t1_jalr8a3
"They're just being precious of their own academy star. And that's natural.

Just as many of us think Foden is a gigantic overrated twatball who is only given the praise he is because a) it's City and b) he's white. Both of these may be true, but really we hate him because c) he gets the praise over Saka.",Arsenal,Yes,jalswyw,t1_jalr4zs
I don't think it's weird. People hate good players of rival teams. I hate Rashford but I think to neutrals he is very likeable,Arsenal,Yes,jalsp8w,t1_jalr4zs
They're salty that Saka is better,Arsenal,Yes,jaltf7k,t1_jalr4zs
"It’s just pure jealousy that we have a younger, more consistent and WC career prospect in Saka compared to Rashford. Lots of dumb Man United fans around the world seeing and seething that we are top of the league with the best RW currently and probably will be for some time. Just pure jealousy lmao.",Arsenal,Yes,jalu16t,t1_jalr4zs
Now I do.  I'm gonna leave this here though.,Arsenal,Yes,jaojzeo,t1_jaojm9n
Yeah neither do I now that I remember 🤣,Arsenal,Yes,jaojt04,t1_jaojj7o
They do in FIFA CM 😛,Arsenal,Yes,japyxoe,t1_japxilf
"Fair point, maybe then just a good option if we were to sell Tierney.",Arsenal,Yes,japy6k3,t1_japxilf
"> Get a grip

This is literally a post where you write opinions, so no need to be a cunt. You could also argue that watching only their chances and seeing him pop up in most of them says something? He's one of my favorite players ever, so I'm always paying attention. This fucking sub, man",Arsenal,Yes,jan71jm,t1_jan6e96
You’ve got a point but Holdings only 27.,Arsenal,Yes,japnmne,t1_japnfw7
"I don't disagree, we're essentially looking for a mid that can also play right back for that and such players are basically unicorns. I also do believe that White can go much further in that role than most and our right back side is basically settled. Maybe the ideal could be adding left side White instead if Tierney wants to move on, and that sounds more achievable.",Arsenal,Yes,janudla,t1_jantdtf
Llorente maybe?,Arsenal,Yes,jaods8n,t1_jantdtf
"Calm down. I am only suggesting where he can improve, not asking Arteta to drop him to the reserves. And I am fully aware of the difficulties of playing against a low block, he can do even better because he has done better and he is capable of it. 

You think a 24yo is at the peak of his powers and can't develop even further?",Arsenal,Yes,jalnq69,t1_jaln07g
"Calm down, lad. He just made the point that Ødegaard can still develop his ability to dictate games in the fist half as brilliantly well as he does second halves. No one says he's shit or should be dropped.",Arsenal,Yes,jalnyc0,t1_jaln07g
Exactly. He's still more experienced than most out there when it comes to avoiding relegation. At the end of the day he still knows the squad better than anyone else so you're not gonna see much change to turn things around drastically.,Arsenal,Yes,jalr1cr,t1_jalps4g
"Yeah it does but individually I can’t really see any good performers other than the cyborg. Rodri has been well below his level this season, Partey and Cas miles ahead. 

Three United players is a lot, tbf you could take Martinez out for Botman or Saliba",Arsenal,Yes,jam39lh,t1_jam30vl
"Taking Thomas out is-- interesting.

He's been better than both Casemiro and Rodri.",Arsenal,Yes,jam4py8,t1_jam40e0
People probably disagreeing. I dont think we would have competed but easily gotten a trophy or 2 during the drought,Arsenal,Yes,japwhuh,t1_japisdi
"Don't really care about what others talk about, I'm talking personal opinion here.

Its not like I'm constantly slating partey or won't celebrate anything he's involved with or anything, it's just conflicting in my mind when I think about the whole situation. I just hope justice is served either way tbh",Arsenal,Yes,jan9nrm,t1_jan5387
Even 5 minutes as a sub though,Arsenal,Yes,jam9q9k,t1_jam9otc
"With teams like Liverpool & Chelsea, the quality is obviously there, it's all about timing. Will they be in form when we play them or not?

Look at Newcastle, they were in formidable defensive form before our home game but things have changed and now I expect City to Spank them this weekend.",Arsenal,Yes,jaoek9r,t1_jaoc4wp
"GW38 with the title at stake still and us needing City to drop points would be horrible though, we all know they'd pull something mad out of the bag and win it. Wish that game was sooner, especially because Toney will be banned for it too.",Arsenal,Yes,jaobqif,t1_jao9zw6
Martinelli has more expected assists (5.81) than Bukayo Saka (5.21),Arsenal,Yes,jals41n,t1_jalqzms
"For my money, it's Saka or Partey. Both are top 3 ITW for their positions.",Arsenal,Yes,jam4onz,t1_jalz0i9
And Partey and Gabriel and Jesus,Arsenal,Yes,jalw2a7,t1_jalu1jg
"Easy games like bournemouth are the perfect way to integrate a new signing into  getting playtime, not an away European knockout even if it has lesser importance. If Kiwior starting means that our chances to win against Bournemouth reduces drastically then he wouldn’t have been signed in the first place, he’s going to get plenty of gametime from next season",Arsenal,Yes,jamhh1k,t1_jamg85x
Realistically who?,Arsenal,Yes,jamj618,t1_jamffzg
"We’ve played amazingly with xhaka in our team who has even lesser technical quality, we’ll be fine with mount. I’ll prefer Mac Allister or Bellingham but if we can’t get them then Mount would be good",Arsenal,Yes,jami29g,t1_jamf0ky
Yeah he'd start LCM for me. Has played LW RW and 9 so will be reslly comfortable with the attacking rotations we ask of those in the forward 5 line.,Arsenal,Yes,jallc2i,t1_jall85q
World class guy but injury record is horrendous,Arsenal,Yes,jallips,t1_jallhhf
Nope. Talent emerges when shits hit rock bottom. Hes so average in every facet of the game thats why you think hes gonna cook because you think he doesnt have any weaknesses but the truth is he doesnt have any strengths at all.,Arsenal,Yes,jaln7s5,t1_jallhf3
"Happy to hear different opinion. 

I feel like he’s been unsure of himself recently. Had some sloppy play, whether making the wrong pass or just not being in sync with the front four movement. Unlike the start of the season where he was an integral part of the attacking play. Yesterday, particularly in the first half, I felt like he was getting caught out a lot and their attacks came down his side",Arsenal,Yes,jalqh85,t1_jalorzx
I’m sure at the start of the season he was overlapping more though? Thought Zinny is the inverted fullback while White stays wide,Arsenal,Yes,jalqkfs,t1_jalpyp7
sums up his season,Arsenal,Yes,jamml25,t1_jamf4iv
He's better but Chelsea won't sell anyways yes.,Arsenal,Yes,jan3yqp,t1_jan3j6v
Only difficult game with respect to form/standing is Newcastle who they’ve already beat,Arsenal,Yes,jap31qq,t1_jap2ym3
I'm glad I was in school with several gooners and virtually no Spurs fans. But then I am from West London. Half these guys were Chelsea and QPR.,Arsenal,Yes,jam1iez,t1_jalw1lw
"Lol how did he miss a sitter against west ham by out jumping villa defenders?

Nah I agree wasn’t close to a sitter, but I think you mean villa park not west ham.",Arsenal,Yes,jam0gis,t1_jalw1s7
That's fair enough,Arsenal,Yes,jamk697,t1_jamk1t1
TAA,Arsenal,Yes,jao10nk,t1_janzxjj
Harry Kewell was a Liverpool fan. Unless a player is a Liverpool fan they have no reason to join them over us this Summer. And Declan Rice definitely is no Liverpool fan.,Arsenal,Yes,janxxru,t1_janx4z7
That is factually false.,Arsenal,Yes,janx2jv,t1_janw1vw
They seem to think Rice is an option for them when it has been made clear he is one of our top targets for the Summer.,Arsenal,Yes,janws9a,t1_janw1vw
I hope they keep on giving him special colorways like his current red boots,Arsenal,Yes,jan2poi,t1_jan1o73
"I do, I'm sure others do as well",Arsenal,Yes,jan28ih,t1_jan1z1f
"Come on my dude, you've been on this planet long enough to know how to properly look at a game. With your vast experience surely you can look at something more critically?",Arsenal,Yes,janfe4j,t1_janf7uq
"And we struggled massively in those 40 minutes, creating nothing.",Arsenal,Yes,jan9r3l,t1_jan8oe7
"No, of course not, any team vying for a title needs a considerable amount of fortune but there were many occasions of City beating down teams looking to take what they can and shut up shop.",Arsenal,Yes,janb7mu,t1_janaqm0
"Deep block is just one facet of the entire system made to neutralise our space in the 2-3-5. Credit to Howe, he created a system well-designed to mitigate an already amazing system.",Arsenal,Yes,jand25k,t1_janc3n0
Yep I have no doubts that this is something Arteta is working on because it's clearly the only real weakness we have at the moment. Once we can get over this stumbling block then I think we are going to be one of the best run clubs from a tactical standpoint in the world.,Arsenal,Yes,jandbkg,t1_jancytx
"Teams are starting to and it's naive to pretend like it's going to be plain sailing from here. 

Newcastle showed teams how to do it and not it's about the application.",Arsenal,Yes,jan88us,t1_jan7yko
*FA Cup Winner Matt Smith - who also hasn't been named in a team since January.,Arsenal,Yes,janpp5x,t1_janp8jl
"I agree it’s too early to put him in the bin. However, this is a club that just seems to sign players for the sake of it and the squad is far too big already. 

I’m shocked they didn’t give Levi Colwill a chance this season and now they have signed two players ahead of him. Colwill will go down as another stupid sale by Chelsea in a few years time when they inevitably sell him this summer.",Arsenal,Yes,jalnp50,t1_jalngzq
God that film was excellent,Arsenal,Yes,jalqk7b,t1_jalqfd2
All their players are better than ours and our soon to be 14 point lead over them is just imaginary,Arsenal,Yes,janzmzs,t1_janywqp
there’s not enough of them to even matter,Arsenal,No,janvnwj,t1_jant3kr
that’s what u get for looking at twitter for that kinda shit lol. who’s rantsandbants?,Arsenal,Yes,janp4kl,t1_jannw1q
"i mean this just isn’t true. whilst zinchenko is brilliant and probably our best player, tied with saka if anything, he’s playing a very similar role to what cancelo had last season just with less goal threat.",Arsenal,Yes,jaot7mx,t1_jaorhi8
"They didn’t know they’d be struggling at the position now, and he’d been a good servant for Pep.",Arsenal,Yes,jaotrk0,t1_jaorhi8
Yeah not saying the Pep of today would necessarily react the same but more an interesting evolution of playing styles from his early Barca days where he expected his players to stick rigidly to his plans. Now his former assistant manager plays a style with a similar philosophy but essentially has this wildcard left back and it still works.,Arsenal,Yes,jaouhth,t1_jaotk59
If they're desperate in May draws won't be an option....,Arsenal,Yes,jan1dvd,t1_jan0pva
but when we're actually good both on and off the field as a club we usually win two or 3 titles in a short period.  I mean that's the same for most well run teams.,Arsenal,Yes,janje73,t1_jani8wd
We're not in the banter era anymore,Arsenal,Yes,janlqt0,t1_jani8wd
The failure to understand both his quality and our tactics is baffling.,Arsenal,Yes,jamajz5,t1_jam8pko
He clearly doesn't work as well with Nketiah and this needs to be worked on or worked around by Arteta.,Arsenal,Yes,jambwz4,t1_jam8pko
So you are telling me we just gotta win Europa this year first? Bet.,Arsenal,Yes,jamkegr,t1_jamgixl
"> Almost no-one comes out of nowhere to win it first go (or rather first go in a while).

I'd argue this is because its insanely rare for a team who wasn't in CL the season before to be one of the best teams in the world, rather than experience being the determining factor. However, here we are. Obviously I wouldnt expect to win CL, basically no team should, but if you told me we were like 6th most likely to win it, I think that could be accurate.",Arsenal,Yes,jampsko,t1_jamgixl
"> the last aubameyang defender

In 2023?! What's there to defend at this point? Man no longer provides any goalscoring threat. Or anything really.",Arsenal,Yes,jan4h06,t1_jamutm9
We should bear in mind what Liverpool did with Coutinho. If a stupidly high offer came in for him and he wanted to go then we should let him and reinvest it.,Arsenal,Yes,jalnr51,t1_jalmpkx
I didn't say we should .....i said I can see him being subject of a big bid,Arsenal,Yes,jalzv3v,t1_jalmpkx
I meant to say “in form”,Arsenal,Yes,jaorlhf,t1_jaorea4
"That's solid, but hasn't Mers already trademarked *What Success?*",Arsenal,Yes,jamkucj,t1_jamkkv8
Ah might throw one on arsenal each way myself,Arsenal,Yes,jalua54,t1_jaltk2d
"Camavinga can defo play that role. He played LB for France, idk what crack Deschamps was smoking but he did exceptionally well there, was our better player on the pitch",Arsenal,Yes,jaomziz,t1_jaoc7ak
"Agreed. 

We need that positive vibes back as I’m sure it’s being reflected on the pitch. I haven’t been able to see the game last night, annoyingly, but I could sense it on the chat on here. Jorginho was slagged off after 4 minutes and someone asked for Martinelli to be subbed at 13 minutes. 

Start of the season just felt like party time. If we can get that back it’ll be a fortress again I’m sure",Arsenal,Yes,jalnjlz,t1_jalncox
"Yeah, well…

Why don't you go eat a Salad Cream sandwich?",Arsenal,Yes,janfrcm,t1_janfi6a
We were toe to toe with them for the most part. Wait for the away fixture.,Arsenal,Yes,jaon5ay,t1_jann1xa
wouldn't them not being able to sign anyone make it more likely for them to not selll anyone?,Arsenal,Yes,janflkv,t1_janbhzc
"I think you're underestimating Martinelli's decision making there.

Martinelli is better at dribbling at speed, is faster, a better one on one finisher and is just as happy playing all across the front three when someone is willing to cover the left wing for him.

He's much more of a poacher and what he doesn't have Jesus does, whereas Trossard is a slightly lesser Jesus with better finishing.",Arsenal,Yes,janjc29,t1_janizo2
"Martinelli is our best finisher. The disrespect from takes like this is hilarious. 

Trossard is a good player, but he’s not on Martinelli’s level.",Arsenal,Yes,jania08,t1_jani14q
Nonsense. That is literally nonsense. He’s marginally better if at all.,Arsenal,Yes,janlv0p,t1_jani14q
That just isn’t true. Slightly better maybe.,Arsenal,Yes,janjawl,t1_jani14q
"I always try an Arsenal save but I get annoyed with it after we do a transfer window as I either have a player they club sold or they buy in someone who I'd love to use in my team lol.

So I usually find more success in keeping a save going with teams I don't follow and I love the lower league challenge to get to the top league. Loved a Kaiserslautern save as well but no Arsenal connection in that one unfortunately.",Arsenal,Yes,jaml0yr,t1_jamjvao
"Then there would be no need for clubs to target 9s.

Just wide forward bonanzas. ETH finally went the Weghorst route. 

They can drift, but their heat map has to specialise.",Arsenal,Yes,jamk20s,t1_jamfp6y
"But would you say that Trossard was elevating our play in that first half against Everton? Because that's the point I'm trying to make.

He plays different as Nketiah, but the result was basically the same. We created fuck all, until the goal. We needed a moment of class from 2 top players to break through. Trossard only started shining when the game opened up more, and Nketiah would have done so aswell I believe.

Once again I'm not trying to shit on Trossard. I'm a big fan of him and I love what he brings to the team. Imagine if we've lost today, he would have been slated.",Arsenal,Yes,jalq8za,t1_jaloyer
"For example if Nketiah convert shit loads of his xG to goals, who would have criticized him? Noone. If u failed that then u must put something else on the table, which is lacking in comparison with what Trossard / Martinelli demonstrated in these two games.",Arsenal,Yes,jalppsp,t1_jalpkhu
"Well if you look at the comments in here, in previous match threads, post game antics etc, he gets a shit ton of hate, which I never understood.

Never seen a Hale end boy get this much slack. You might not be hating on him, but you can't deny he gets hate from a big part of our fanbase",Arsenal,Yes,jalpuwl,t1_jalpkhu
Our LHS was not particularly good in the first half though. Don’t know how you can say that’s wrong. Neither goal came from that side and the 40 minutes before the goal weren’t exactly brilliant from us.,Arsenal,Yes,jalo0oh,t1_jalnqsp
We didn’t create a single chance blud. literally 0 shots lmao. Everton completely nullified us because we couldn’t sustain pressure without Partey,Arsenal,Yes,jaloqfc,t1_jalnqsp
"To be fair Everton were also really good in the first 40 minutes at what they were looking to do, which is fair enough.

But Ode - Saka is just magic, and from there it was all over for them.",Arsenal,Yes,jalnuh0,t1_jalnqkh
"I mean that's how a season goes. Nobody is saying ""City are only in the title race still because VAR fucked Arsenal and they played Arsenal away when Arsenal were in bad form"".",Arsenal,Yes,jam1k11,t1_jam050j
lol.  People who simp the players like OP are fucking weird mate.  You know the players would read that and side eye....,Arsenal,Yes,jan38jq,t1_jan2ifw
I bet gary glitter said he was kids uncles a lot too....,Arsenal,Yes,janbqgz,t1_janbkw7
Well their title strip might mean United will get some of those EPL’s,Arsenal,Yes,jap7o7j,t1_jap5kul
"It was never a penalty and it wasn’t a free kick in the first half. Also Adebayors shirts were almost pulled off late on before they equalized. Clearest penalty all season not given.
Mike Deans role in that collapse is not forgotten",Arsenal,Yes,jao9jha,t1_jao41pe
"Most of last night had Trossard out on the left and Gabi through the middle. 

Maybe the solution is just....

Gabi through the middle = Gabi scores more goals. 

Not shitting on Trossard, he's been class, brings a level of flexibility to our game. But this idea that idea thar Eddie refuses to pass to Marti I think misses out that he's just fundamentally a different type of player.",Arsenal,Yes,janppxt,t1_janowe6
Eddie was on the pitch for two of those four goals mate. And Trossard only assisted him for one. Trossard has been great but to attribute Martinelli’s goalscoring form to him is a massive oversimplification.,Arsenal,Yes,janpzur,t1_janowe6
"Some Arsenal fans are so weird, just looking for excuses to shit on Nketiah for some reason",Arsenal,Yes,janyvm9,t1_jans0r8
It has nothing to do with Eddie's linkup play which is very good.,Arsenal,Yes,janysbq,t1_janrlub
which isn't link up play,Arsenal,Yes,janyz37,t1_janwv8t
"Current odds go Haaland, then ode, rashford then saka",Arsenal,Yes,jalv6ef,t1_jalur7p
So like I said hopefully we get Camavinga,Arsenal,Yes,jao1zwu,t1_jao1ve0
I trust in teta but I can't imagine a midfield of partey and jorg without changing our system up completely.,Arsenal,Yes,jaot55u,t1_jao94j7
"Greenwood was good, he just ended up being a shit human",Arsenal,Yes,jaq3oej,t1_jaq0v8x
"Zinny is ahead of the pecking order for a reason. Do u agree? 

So let's dig out what Zinny can do and KT fails to do, and u will get it.",Arsenal,Yes,jalqd4j,t1_jalpfko
"This. I'd rather play Partey in the PL games and Jorginho in the Europa, for instance.",Arsenal,Yes,jam9lxf,t1_jam2x5r
"He would, and he'd improve us-- but the point about wages and limitations stands.

There are a lot of midfielders who would improve us there.",Arsenal,Yes,jan4g45,t1_jan2w0r
Someone like Toney.,Arsenal,Yes,jaltkp8,t1_jaltctc
I mean they all hold French citizenships so that technically makes them French people,Arsenal,Yes,janhr9o,t1_janhnad
"Mbappe is half Cameroonian, half Algerian

I'm talking about descent",Arsenal,Yes,janj5xh,t1_janj2wp
"why wouldn't it be the reason why?  Why would you question a 2nd, 3rd, or later generation's frenchness..... well unless you're a racist lol.",Arsenal,Yes,jane8cc,t1_jancweh
"There are people saying he was questioned though.

Obvioulsy racism is stupid as fuck anyway and isn't really at home to logic but FIFA rules that you can play for a country with one grandparent, gaining citizenship or just having spent the majority of your education there so using eligibility for your national team as 'proof' of some sort of pure bloodline is just stupid to begin with.",Arsenal,Yes,janohgc,t1_jannfg8
"Still always thought he was French.

I mean there's very few people who are 'English' and don't have at least one non english grandparent if not more and we're on an island so the second largest country on the continent is going to have a lot more people with mixed heritages.",Arsenal,Yes,jann44p,t1_janmqey
Yes and hes hilarious (to laugh at),Arsenal,Yes,jamygtk,t1_jamycz0
It's easy but but not impossible to not have a positive atmosphere,Arsenal,Yes,jap66jy,t1_jaotwmr
Went in one once and never again! I had to like check my eyes to see if I was watching the same game as everyone else in the thread lmao,Arsenal,Yes,jaoy0sp,t1_jaotwmr
Yesterday was the first time nelli played well with eddie,Arsenal,Yes,jalshsg,t1_jalq3by
when the team is 3-0 up with 10 minutes left and the rest of the team is on fire it's easier to get a goal rather than at 0-0 or 1-0,Arsenal,Yes,jalslig,t1_jalq3by
grasping at straws,Arsenal,Yes,jalqpuw,t1_jalq3by
"Well, last two game has just demonstrated that. Nketiah has to fight for his place, intense competition since ESR is back, and Jesus will be back very soon. Arteta is spoilt for choice at the front, so let's hope Nketiah add something to his game ASAP,  begging for tolerance won't help his chance I'm afraid.",Arsenal,Yes,jalqsuq,t1_jalq3by
Fair! It would have been a fun final if we did end up playing them there. Would have liked the revenge!,Arsenal,Yes,jaonery,t1_jaojzeo
"Woah calm down there just having a friendly discussion. Don’t need to take everything so personally.

What exactly feels “off” about him? How was his performance off?",Arsenal,Yes,jan7ebo,t1_jan71jm
"He's in the category of lukewarm talent that accepts the part. Like Elneny, Nelson.",Arsenal,Yes,japoc70,t1_japnmne
"> left side White

Tomi.  

I like the idea of developing our own version of Zinchenko though.  While his skillset is unique, I don't necessarily think its rare.",Arsenal,Yes,janvm45,t1_janudla
What can he improve then? His off the ball movement is excellent in the first half he was surrounded by 3 players all the time. Teams know his final ball is butter. If you watch the first goal again and look at Ode hes in perfect position to make the the CB off balance thats why Saka was so free to take that shot. Sometimes not having the ball is not being anonymous.,Arsenal,Yes,jalokob,t1_jalnq69
It’s really close in my opinion. Take any of those three out and their respective teams are 10-15 points lower.,Arsenal,Yes,jam4zho,t1_jam4py8
Agreed. Good on you.,Arsenal,Yes,janajha,t1_jan9nrm
"Okay, I now understand what you mean.

I also don't like it that it's this way but am not gonna consider it a black mark, the players have worked too hard for this so am not gonna let anything affect my enjoyment of the success we may or may not have",Arsenal,Yes,jane5oz,t1_jan9nrm
"nah too soon

there are other bench players who need minutes ahead of him right now

he'll get involved in the European games",Arsenal,Yes,jamaehm,t1_jam9q9k
"Form is definitely part of it, but I think the locker room doesn't respect potter at this point. The toxic Chelsea culture of win or get the sack is really hurting them currently and I don't think it will change unless they sack him and get a new manager bounce. 

This is nothing against Potter btw, I think he's a decent manager, just the wrong club for him.",Arsenal,Yes,jaoffka,t1_jaoek9r
"> Easy games 

No such thing",Arsenal,Yes,jamhytu,t1_jamhh1k
ESR,Arsenal,Yes,jamm9g1,t1_jamj618
Even Fabio Vieira seems to better suit the role than him,Arsenal,Yes,jampnpa,t1_jamj618
World class? This tag is so overused it's lost meaning.,Arsenal,Yes,jalmpng,t1_jallips
"Well he still does occasionally, he was whipping in some great crosses against Everton. But it’s not necessary. We are creating and scoring enough atm.",Arsenal,Yes,jalr9iq,t1_jalqkfs
"They have the toughest schedule based on gambling odds, average position in the table and home vs away opponents.",Arsenal,Yes,jap7vm6,t1_jap31qq
">Lol how did he miss a sitter against west ham by out jumping villa defenders?

TIL triple threat matches are a thing in football now",Arsenal,Yes,jam7jck,t1_jam0gis
Oh yeah forgot,Arsenal,Yes,jao6gdf,t1_jao10nk
It's factually true they're cheap as a Red Sox fan they let a top 3 player in the game get traded because they didn't want to pay him same with our best SS,Arsenal,Yes,janxpvv,t1_janx2jv
Why though.  Whats the branding on his boots matter as long as they don't provide him with lead clogs?,Arsenal,Yes,jan3cgs,t1_jan28ih
Honestly think you might be on your own on this one mate,Arsenal,Yes,jan6ett,t1_jan28ih
"I saw a team park the bus for 40 minutes and us undo them.

People park the bus all the time, it's when they can do it succesfully that you can start worrying and winning 4-0 means they didn't park the bus succesfully.",Arsenal,Yes,jang4vp,t1_janfe4j
"And yet.... would still have had 50 more mins to work it out..... but we did it without needing all those minutes... didn't we....

nugget.",Arsenal,Yes,jana5zr,t1_jan9r3l
"Yh it’s a good strategy but can be beaten like all systems can be. The way our players change position so fluidly and move the ball into the right spaces is the only way to beat those systems. I think Trossard now coming in along with Jesus hopefully coming back, will allow us to break those teams down. Newcastle played it well but we also could’ve taken advantage a bit better in certain moments. Very rare that 2 games of football are ever the same. I trust Mikel to make the right adjustments to deal with those sort of setups (we did last night tbf) when we face them.",Arsenal,Yes,janecfd,t1_jand25k
"Well I disagree. That win over Everton was one of our most comfortable all season. And with Trossard filling in the Jesus role, we can start playing like we did pre-world cup. 

No need to worry about a problem until there is a problem.",Arsenal,Yes,jan8wuu,t1_jan88us
Omari Hutchinson made such a stupid decision going there... Like why on earth would he think Chelsea is a better enviornement for him to break into the first team than ours?,Arsenal,Yes,jalz1dw,t1_jalnp50
"Oh, i want that club to become irrelevant like Spurs, let Todd the clueless punk keep making bad decisions.",Arsenal,Yes,jalnwhr,t1_jalnp50
">However, this is a club that just seems to sign players for the sake of it

Sadly this is how they actually think too. All over Reddit chelshit fans were chuffed they beat us to Mudryk's signature. Most literally couldn't tell you anything about him or how he'd improve their squad but they didn't care, preventing us from signing him and forcing us onto a plan B (in Trossard) was enough for them. 

I wonder how many of them still have the same opinion now.",Arsenal,Yes,jaoqeno,t1_jalnp50
"Point taken.

And he is an absolute cunt of a United fan. He was calling Saka the “black James Milner” the other day while labouring the same point. He’s a prick.",Arsenal,Yes,janpn7r,t1_janp4kl
"They have no fire power. Best option they have is what they’re doing now which is sitting deep and hoping to scrape 1-0 wins


Going all out for a win against city would be suicide",Arsenal,Yes,jan29m6,t1_jan1dvd
"I agree we're in a great place, but so were Topspur under Poche and it fizzled out. It also feels like it's a different landscape in the Prem from when Wenger racked up titles. We've gone from talking of ""Top 2"" to ""Top 6"" in 20 years.

I'm optimistic—this year is competitive (unlike 15/16) and we're deservedly on top—but remember Klopp's team were possibly one season cancellation from not winning the league.

And if we dream of that CL trophy with this squad, besting City now is such a huge confidence swing over having to recharge next year.",Arsenal,Yes,jannc1l,t1_janje73
Which is not a reason to hate on Martinelli,Arsenal,Yes,jamcj5l,t1_jambwz4
"Liverpool sold Coutinho to fund their rebuild. 

Our rebuild is nearing completion.",Arsenal,Yes,jalvr7s,t1_jalnr51

"Because I have pride.

And taste buds",Arsenal,Yes,jang74g,t1_janfrcm
"Mate if anything, Martinelli’s decision making is his weakest/poorest attribute. He frequently shoots when should pass and vice versa. Trossard is more balanced.",Arsenal,Yes,janjz8v,t1_janjc29
"Well you just repeated everything I said about nelli, not sure why.
I didn't say he has bad decision making, but he often gets past his man, opening up for a cross and just hesitates, cuts back or runs too long with the ball. Trossard is clear on that aspect.",Arsenal,Yes,janjxv5,t1_janjc29
"Maye, have you seen some of the bangers trossard scored this season for Brighton? His finishing is class",Arsenal,Yes,janjgj5,t1_jania08
"No right now Trossard is the better finisher, he's scored some mad ones this season.",Arsenal,Yes,janl885,t1_jania08
"I didn’t dispute his finishing. I only mentioned his technical ability which includes things like dribbling, passing etc which trossard is way better at",Arsenal,Yes,janiqc6,t1_jania08
"Target 9s in what context?

It's easier to have a 9 focal point but it also makes it easier for defences to mark and develop a plan to limit the effect of that focal point. You see games every week where a focal point striker is starved and largely ineffective.

I don't agree with that last point as said in my previous comment.",Arsenal,Yes,jamky9h,t1_jamk20s
"The first goal was a concerted TEAM GOAL, for God sake pls go and watch again. Look where Trossard was, how Ode delay his passing to induce pressing, and Zinny cutting into the right to create overload, and Saka just step into the tiny gap just 1 m away from Tarkowski, and Zinny releas the ball....",Arsenal,Yes,jalr8xj,t1_jalq8za
Yeah i can agree with that sentiment. Everyone was playing top football after the game opened up.,Arsenal,Yes,jalqivh,t1_jalq8za
"Which player didn't have a shit tonnes of hatred with the exception of our darling starboy Saka? 

Read thru the match thread u understand what I said. These kids just forget what they said as soon as the next goal.

So best solution is to shut up their mouth with end products.",Arsenal,Yes,jalqj15,t1_jalpuwl
"The goals didn't come from the sleft side BUT it came from our continuous probing thru ball. We had at least 8~9 attempts I lost count , we succeed in the 40th. That's how u breakdown a low block by constantly moving around, making defenders lost track - hence the first goal.",Arsenal,Yes,jalp5np,t1_jalo0oh
"Yes it's true not a shot initially, but did u count the final balls we tried? How do breakdown walls in order to shoot, the walls are compact and physical! U try thru ball into the tiny gaps, 1/10 success rate is a VERY GOOD RETURN. I'll take that any time.",Arsenal,Yes,jalq5q6,t1_jaloqfc

Isn't that a fair decision?,Arsenal,Yes,japdban,t1_jap7o7j
"nevertheless, gabi in the middle = gabi goals does indicate it would be ideal if eddie got better and more comfortable playing as wide drifter, basically as a winger, to optimally contribute to our system. 

in fairness, his performance was encouraging. he's progressed a lot, always adding new things and pushing his limits. his mentality is solid, i think he'll grow his playing chemistry with martinelli soon",Arsenal,Yes,jansfb1,t1_janppxt
Having Trossard start it allows him to interchange from the wings to centrally.,Arsenal,Yes,janq1rv,t1_janppxt
"I'm with you, I think the injury that Eddie was carrying + the amount of game load he has had are bigger factors. It's great to be able to move to Trossard as cover and he offers something a bit different to keep us more varied and unpredictable.",Arsenal,Yes,janqy9m,t1_janpzur
He makes it easier on Martinelli same way Jesus did. Eddie is a poacher his link up play doesn't fit Martinelli,Arsenal,Yes,janqaxp,t1_janpzur
It doesn't matter Gabi plays better with trossard that's obvious,Arsenal,Yes,jao073f,t1_janyz37

This team needs a player with elite movement that can swap to the wings, not a target man.",Arsenal,Yes,jalu113,t1_jaltkp8
"You don't even need that to represent france, just a french grandparent.

If someone wants to play for france, is eligible for france and is willing to put up with watching Griezmann practice his stupid celebrations all day then there really shouldn't be any question of their commitment to france.",Arsenal,Yes,jani6li,t1_janhr9o
Ohh gotcha. Descent doesn’t mean much in these cases. 1/3 the US team national team is from overseas also so it’s just the nature of national teams.,Arsenal,Yes,janm1qv,t1_janj5xh
I'm not. But if he weren't White I know some that would...,Arsenal,Yes,janfnrg,t1_jane8cc
"yeah started following him recently on twitter, has been great. there was some compilation of all his tiktoks this year that was soooooo good lol",Arsenal,Yes,jamynfd,t1_jamygtk
They’re cesspits of misery *unless* we’re destroying the opposition. When we were up 4-0 yesterday it was like a party,Arsenal,Yes,jaoyx42,t1_jaoy0sp
"So what changed yesterday, and is it replicable going forward?",Arsenal,Yes,jalstso,t1_jalshsg
Sure. That doesn’t mean what I said isn’t also true though.,Arsenal,Yes,jalsp2p,t1_jalslig
Hardly. I’m just trying to understand what actually happened in the game rather than going along with the prevailing narrative.,Arsenal,Yes,jalqwr8,t1_jalqpuw
To be fair you started off with ‘Get a grip.’ That’s going to annoy anyone from the get go.,Arsenal,Yes,jan897m,t1_jan7ebo
"Didn't feel particularly friendly. His feet have looked heavier than usual, obviously don't expect him to dribble beyond too many guys, maybe it's just a minutes thing and he's tired. What worries me is his defensive presence nearer our box. He's still winning the ball back on attack, but his positioning when defending our half hasn't been great. Again, he looks to be actively avoiding fouling in a dangerous position...which we've been awful at, so Maybe that's an Arteta directive",Arsenal,Yes,jan8t7d,t1_jan7ebo
My wild prediction is that Patino becomes an inverted LB,Arsenal,Yes,janwxpv,t1_janvm45
"I can see why left side Tomi could be great as well but what's particular reason you'd prefer that? Defensive solidity? 

I like the idea of developing a right side Zinchenko too, perhaps we can bring in a youngster. The player just needs to be really technically able.",Arsenal,Yes,janwvh0,t1_janvm45
That's certainly true.,Arsenal,Yes,jam5nu8,t1_jam4zho
Probably comes down to whoever wins the league then. Feel like Casemiro is a lock because Utd media bias,Arsenal,Yes,jam6y6o,t1_jam4zho
That's totally fair and prob the best way to look at the whole thing,Arsenal,Yes,jangbwl,t1_jane5oz
"Usually yes

But this Bournemouth team looks absolutely awful.",Arsenal,Yes,jammmnf,t1_jamhytu
get ‘em aofrantic,Arsenal,Yes,japflch,t1_jap7vm6
Look at all the championships they have won. They have a method that they trust and it produces results.,Arsenal,Yes,janyyij,t1_janxpvv
"Critical thought isn't your strongest asset, is it.",Arsenal,Yes,janaoaz,t1_jana5zr
"Comfortable after we broke the deadlock, yes. That's what happens when a team whose plan is solely based around mitigating the opponent suddenly needs to chase.",Arsenal,Yes,jan9mww,t1_jan8wuu
"The only defence I can give him is that Saka is an icon and generational talent from the academy playing in the same position. So unlikely to be starting whereas Chelsea don’t have that.

However, that’s me clutching at straws as he could be playing in cup competitions here and getting minutes that way which he isn’t there at all. They tried to send him to WBA and that failed. 

He is the sort of player I can see doing well for Reading or QPR in a few years time.",Arsenal,Yes,jalz7zp,t1_jalz1dw
"Yep. Finish in the bottom waste even more cash and split it over 5-8 years and screw over tomorrows windows too! 

That guy is a fool.",Arsenal,Yes,jalodtk,t1_jalnwhr
How the hell is conte up for manager of the month btw! I’m fairly sure the only game he was on the touchline for was Leicester and they got smashed haha 😂,Arsenal,Yes,jalof89,t1_jalnwhr
"I remember that and it just showed an embarrassment to football for me. We even had them come on to this fan page to insult us.

However, I would say I liked Rory on YouTube speaking about it. He called it out and said it was pathetic (not mudryk himself but the situation) and he lost connection with his club over the dirty cash business.",Arsenal,Yes,jaorm2d,t1_jaoqeno
"Rantsandbants is a fucking knob lmao. He does that podcast with expressions (I actually rate ex very highly, he’s hilarious and such a likeable guy) and his agenda towards Arsenal is on another level. Like way more than United fans i know. The guy is literally another cunt of a Londoner supporting the shitedevils up north. Biggest arsenal shittaker on the internet. Will hit like crack seeing him cry when we win those major trophies and his shitty SAF, bald fraud club rots to the ground again.",Arsenal,Yes,janzc06,t1_janpn7r
well that’s certainly a take,Arsenal,Yes,janqekd,t1_janpn7r
If they need the points they need the points...... a draw is worthless if it still means you get relegated.,Arsenal,Yes,jan3ggk,t1_jan29m6
">I agree we're in a great place, but so were Topspur under Poche and it fizzled out

Firstly - they were never anywhere near our current points per game pace. Even if there is a drop off, this Arteta still to be completed team would still be better.

Secondly, Topspur didn't fizzle out, they had a good run of 5 years or so, played a CL final, etc. Given our current squad is better than that Spurs squad, who knows what is possible for us in the next 5 years. Claiming that we will be relegated to 4th behind City, United and Liverpool is wrong.",Arsenal,Yes,janoclj,t1_jannc1l
"Don't see how you can compare us to that topspur period.

The level of investment and more importantly the quality of how we've invested it are levels on that team.

Then Liverpool..... again the level of squad management is what cost them plus some bad luck with injuries.  Look at what we have now, we're already better prepared for injuries than they ever were.",Arsenal,Yes,janpl1b,t1_jannc1l
"Not excusing hate but honestly I haven't seen much that I would call ""hate"". I think that some criticism of his late-January and February performances is fair. He wasn't performing nearly as well as he had been pre-world cup and people acknowledging that and suggesting Trossard come in for a while for Martinelli to have a bit of a rest is fair enough.

If there was more than that then I'd agree on it but I just haven't seen much of it.",Arsenal,Yes,jamdh2z,t1_jamcj5l
"Is your proposal that we turn down things like record sales fees and force players who wanted out to stay? That's the sort of final action that makes you say, ""rebuild complete""? 

If someone wants to leave and we're staring at the right offer for it too we shouldn't underestimate what forcing them to stay could do to the team chemistry and state of our rebuild.",Arsenal,Yes,jampfcu,t1_jalvr7s
"Good idea actually, wasn’t even thinking that",Arsenal,Yes,jalumpc,t1_jaludm7
"Think there's some receny bias here with Trossard, just this last game you've had a goal where he's read what both Saka and Eddie were going to do perfectly and he was integral to the opener by being on the right wing (with our left back) causing the overload that allows saka to get free and score.",Arsenal,Yes,jankn17,t1_janjz8v
"I didn't, reread what I said!",Arsenal,Yes,jankdxn,t1_janjxv5
"Yes, he’s a great technical player. So is martinelli. Saying he’s 100x more technical player than Gabi is a ridiculous disrespectful take. 

Fans have a nasty habit of trying to tear down others while lifting up others. Martinelli is a spectacular technical player in different ways. Excellent first touch, great dribbler, great finisher.",Arsenal,Yes,jao33z1,t1_janjgj5
"Huh? Martinelli is 4th in the league in successful dribbles. He’s one of the best in the league at it. 

Trossard is a tidy player, but this comment from you is perplexing.",Arsenal,Yes,janjnx6,t1_janiqc6
"And that's one moment in the whole of the first half. Would you argue that Nketiah would not create one moment for others?

You are so high on your ""Trossard is so much better than Nketiah"" horse that you fail to see my reasoning. 

You are acting like Trossard personally decimated that Everton low block yesterday, when the reality is that we didn't create a single opportunity until the 35th minute. That's very similar to what happened with Nketiah or worse.

I love Trossard and he deserves all the plaudits, but I don't understand how people can say he is so much better than Nketiah after this game",Arsenal,Yes,jalsaqa,t1_jalr8xj
"Ppl don't realise the assist came from Zinny , and Trossard was on the far left taking away a defender with him. Without the fluidity we will have big trouble breaking down the walls. Everton has done a good job for 40 minutes, credit where credit due.",Arsenal,Yes,jalpcyj,t1_jalp5np
Our “probing” was largely ineffective in the first 40 minutes though. I’m not sure we even had a shot. We created next to nothing until the goal. And it wasn’t the LHS that opened up their defence.,Arsenal,Yes,jalp9tg,t1_jalp5np
I'd love to know how old you are to see where on the stupid to creepy scale your original comment lies.,Arsenal,Yes,janfnm6,t1_janf0w3
No,Arsenal,Yes,japtxnl,t1_japdban
"Eddie’s link up with Martinelli hasn’t been great until last night - he did literally assist Martinelli, remember - but it’s still an oversimplification to attribute Martinelli’s goalscoring to Trossard. Two things to consider - Martinelli was dropped for Trossard vs. Villa, giving him a much needed rest. Second, Martinelli has scored after drifting centrally, both with and without Trossard involved in the buildup, and Eddie literally facilitated that exact thing last night. The main thing that has changed is the fact that Martinelli is now in fact rotating into CF, when he wasn’t before. That is as much a tactical shift as it is a shift resulting from changing personnel.",Arsenal,Yes,janrmy1,t1_janqaxp
Im not denying that Im just calling this guy out for needlessly shitting on Nketiah,Arsenal,Yes,jao0azp,t1_jao073f
"Saka has better GA, plays for the top side and influences matches way more even when not contributing. It isn't bias...",Arsenal,Yes,jam02zl,t1_jalvx4x
"You get forgot the Man U bias that will inevitably be shown. I think if they get CL and FA + Carabao, which is very doable, he 100% wins it just based on pure circlejerk. Haaland or Saka deserve based on who wins the league IMO.",Arsenal,Yes,jam177q,t1_jalvx4x

He was good. Same level with Martinelli at some point.,Arsenal,Yes,jaqdc1y,t1_jaq4euy
"We have seen many many times last season when we played the U shaped passing , until KT crossed. Do u remember?

It was not working and the coaches don't think it works, hence we stop putting in cross upon cross. U remember Trossard assist Ode? He had a glance before he send in a low cut back to Ode, that's what we expect from the wing.... We were never the taller team, and we are not now.q",Arsenal,Yes,jalrlh3,t1_jalqnbw

"I was at work while everyone else partied :( 

Oh well we will just have to repeat the performance this weekend 😎",Arsenal,Yes,japm5hz,t1_jaoyx42
"I was at the game so I'm telling you firsthand what I witnessed. Eddie ironically got his assist because he did something he rarely ever does... come out wide and square it across the box.

Trossard unlocked martinelli once more, he plays like a mini Jesus in that false 9 role. Gabi got a dangerous dribble in so many times because the Everton defence was utterly confused whether to go after him or trossard. They kept interchanging the ball and interchanging positions and it confused the hell out of them.

Nketiah stays mostly down the middle to do one purpose: score. But lately his finishing hasn't been great, and that was personified when he missed an absolute sitter from partey's wonderful over the top ball.",Arsenal,Yes,jalsixj,t1_jalqwr8
Hard to convey tone over typed comments but I didn’t mean anything by it. Calling me a cunt seems like an overreaction.,Arsenal,Yes,jan8kj5,t1_jan897m
He looked more comfortable when Partey came on imo so maybe it’s a question of how mobile our holding midfielder is which lets Xhaka have less defensive responsibility.,Arsenal,Yes,jan9l9h,t1_jan8t7d
It's something I could see happening too.  That one still has some time on the vine.,Arsenal,Yes,janyjnt,t1_janwxpv
Tomi played on the left side against Liverpool.  I think he's a really excellent inverted FB and covers space well.  His quality is ultimately dwarfed by what Zinchenko does.,Arsenal,Yes,janydaw,t1_janwvh0

"True but at Arsenal there's room for him to be in that winger discussion and come in and out...

"Well, they can't nominate Stellini can they? If any ounce of the manager of the month curse still exist, i want him to win it and exert further misery on Chicken and Ball fc",Arsenal,Yes,jaltzcr,t1_jalof89

"They need the points now yet still went for a draw against us and only managed to nick a goal on a corner.

I have been trying to tell everybody the ENTIRE team tried several attempts in THRU BALL , no less than 8~9 times if recall correctly, until 40 minutes we had one success, then the entire game opens up.

"You're probably spot on. The whole squad completely changes when Partey comes on, unsurprisingly. But now that you mention it, Jorginho didn't have a great defensive match, apparently he was sick so that makes a lot of sense, so maybe Granit was frustrated",Arsenal,Yes,janacps,t1_jan9l9h

He was badly advised and in reality that guy they signed from PSV(?) will mean his future is over before it started. He never got any minutes anyway and they were playing Ziyech ahead of him, a player they deemed not good enough and wanted rid of. 

Definitely an agent move. It’s why I liked that youngster of ours recently that signed a new contract. Sees ESR, Eddie and Saka as icons. I want that mentality coming through. Not if I can’t play now I’m out. 

As Eddie said to Sambi - why you feeling sad for yourself, we are all in it, work hard… or whatever. It’s a great mentality to have",Arsenal,Yes,jam060v,t1_jalzvy3
"That’s fair it just feels weird that the guy on the touch line isn’t the one up for it. 

I shouldn’t complain though - as this is basically how I got a good grade for some of my uni assignments",Arsenal,Yes,jalyo1u,t1_jaltzcr
"So you're an idiot and can't tell the difference in urgency between getting points now and in the last few games.....

I'm out.",Arsenal,Yes,jan4fua,t1_jan44l8
"And my point is that we are already much better than them (even before we sign Rice), hence instead of finishing second in the CL, finishing 3rd in the PL, we can absolutely win those titles.",Arsenal,Yes,janpyr3,t1_janp0nq
"Haha, I suspect that might be it! I also have a tendency to try and avoid the match threads and pretend they don't exist because they're just pure toxicity",Arsenal,Yes,jamgc05,t1_jamezv2

Edit: or maybe not with the odds being better",Arsenal,Yes,jaluq5b,t1_jaluoi7

"So when the entire team tries and fails through balls, that's an improvement?",Arsenal,Yes,jalxitb,t1_jalx2ze
"Martinelli drifted to the RHS and combined with Saka, which was entirely my point!",Arsenal,Yes,jalq53y,t1_jalpz5v
"You've got 17 upvotes and this place is full of weirdos like you.  I'm sure most people look at that statement and think ""what a sad cunt"".  Pretty sure Saka would look at that comment and side eye rams dale with a smirk.... you know, because they're normal people.",Arsenal,Yes,janp27z,t1_jano8ez
"Because fuck United, they got second place at the end of the day. Those seasons should just be binned off entirely if that’s the case. No official winner.",Arsenal,Yes,jaqh7bz,t1_japwt7d
"Firstly, Eddie was rested because he has played 90 minutes of every single game since the World Cup, and had reportedly had an ankle knock. Second, clearly Trossard has a lot to offer. I’m so glad he’s fit into this team like a glove and helped us get through the rough patch we were in. But rotations between the front three are not simply attributed to players’ natural tendencies. Trossard didn’t invent rotations, and he isn’t the only option we can play at 9 who can do them. This is coached - it is a tactical decision to put Martinelli into dangerous positions in the centre of the pitch and overload the RHS.",Arsenal,Yes,jansunx,t1_jans2n4
"Kindly show me any compilation Tierney's cut back has result in a goal, or at least an attempt at goal. I love to see it.

"In all competitions? I didn't specify PL goals only, you did.",Arsenal,Yes,jaludp5,t1_jaluae8
We saw Eddie out wide and Jesus/Nketiah centrally with both interchanging in the Europa League and Nketiah looked poor. He’s just not a good wide player at all,Arsenal,Yes,jaltnvd,t1_jalszt2
"We had a lengthy discussion I said Nketiah needs to learn that. He has to involve his teammates more, rather than just sit in the box awaiting service. I'm not blaming him, he is a Poacher by nature, changing his preference takes time.",Arsenal,Yes,jalznn4,t1_jalszt2
"Even at his fittest Jorg isn’t the quickest man in the world. I like what he’s done so far, but there is a reason our win percentage with Partey is way better than without him.",Arsenal,Yes,janbeq8,t1_janacps
"Yeah, we should…… if we play our first XI.",Arsenal,Yes,jane32p,t1_jan1abb
"you don't get the idea of a hard to complete task actually being hard to complete do you?  If we were creating loads of chances then the team we were facing clearly wasn't hard to break down in the first place...

as I said.... nugget.",Arsenal,Yes,janbzrx,t1_janbrg6
"But Man United at home happened, and Spurs away happened and Brighton away happened. There is no pattern, you are just cherry picking random games to support your conclusion. 

Partey back in the team now after being subbed on at half time. We instantly improved with him. He makes us better. Jesus back soon too. There is more to be excited about than worried.",Arsenal,Yes,janbqyb,t1_janbbkc
"Dyche has never even done it when keeping Burnley up by his teeth. They’re not gonna go all out.


We are allowed to disagree you pleb",Arsenal,Yes,jan6ybi,t1_jan4fua
"I don't include match threads, that's just too easy!

Even Saka gets hate on those..",Arsenal,Yes,jamgsbc,t1_jamgc05
"I'd disagree there.

If you got Napoli a month ago when they were 14/1, that was tremendous value.

They were good favorites in the r16 tie (I bet huge on them to win in Germany), but their odds will be heavily draw dependent.

They could draw Dortmund, Spurs, Milan etc and be down to 4/1 and you can hedge for profit.

Or they could draw City and be back to 12/1 or worse (even though I like them in this matchup)",Arsenal,Yes,jaluwsy,t1_jaluq5b
"Nothing really to agree or disagree here. Imo and I’ve seen other fans say it as well, for all of Martinelli’s positive traits, his decision-making is the poorest. Hopefully it becomes better with experience.",Arsenal,Yes,janoiad,t1_jano3rr
U fucking blind to read we led by 2 goals at half time?,Arsenal,Yes,jalxnvm,t1_jalxitb
Why Marti was able to drift towards the right? Coz Trossard swap with him..That simple and u try to argue.,Arsenal,Yes,jalrdgt,t1_jalq53y

"i can show you tierney threading the needle for sakas goal against city last season if you like. or if you want a better example, odegaards goal against everton away last year came from a tierney cross, you know, the team you think we shouldn't be crossing against",Arsenal,Yes,jalxokc,t1_jalwi7n
"So you're just asking for a player to average 30 in all comps when Henry, the best ever and our best player, also didn't manage to do so?

He did average 32 if you take out 06/07, but ""hey, just be as good as prime Thierry henry"" is a hilarious bar to set.

And that is in all competitions.",Arsenal,Yes,jalukyh,t1_jaludp5
"That is literally the whole point, lol. It's about the application of the process Newcastle offered teams. Everton's application wasn't as good as it was in the reverse fixture, but if teams can match it we are going to struggle. 

We didn't create any chances before we broke the deadlock, jfc. 

It's not hard. Think.",Arsenal,Yes,jancmnl,t1_janbzrx
"Lol?

The pattern is teams adopting a low block 451, doubling up on our wingers and having a strong foundation 3-man midfield to mitigate the space our 2-3-5 offers. None of those teams in the games you mentioned used this against us but multiple teams have since we drew to Newcastle. 

That's the pattern lol, it's okay if you can't see it.

And who said I was worried? I said it's something to work on because we aren't perfect, that doesn't mean I'm worried dumpy.",Arsenal,Yes,janc93z,t1_janbqyb
define urgency.....,Arsenal,Yes,jan7loy,t1_jan6ybi
"I managed to get them at 11/1



And agreed I think city will be hoping they don’t draw Napoli",Arsenal,Yes,jalw8ov,t1_jaluwsy
"> Nothing really to agree or disagree here.

Well apart from your very next statement...

Have a good one mate",Arsenal,Yes,janpl1l,t1_janoiad
At any time I'll take that 4:0 result. Every single fucking time! Got it?,Arsenal,Yes,jalxr5u,t1_jalxnvm
"Is Eddie incapable of swapping with Martinelli? And if so, how did he get an assist doing exactly that?",Arsenal,Yes,jals95q,t1_jalrdgt
"That is good to hear, show me the cut back u mentioned. I watched every Arsenal game, and I love to have Tierney on my side, my only reservation is he has to improve his decision making, not bombing down the flank every time, there are options u see.

Ofc Zinny is in front of the pecking order, noone should question that.",Arsenal,Yes,jaly9px,t1_jalxokc
"Yeah. Around 30 or so goals a season. Not unreasonable. Plenty of players in the last decade have done so. Messi, Ronaldo, Lewandowski, Salah, Kane, Aguero, Mbappe, Suarez, Haaland etc even guys like Mane, Son, Higuain and Benzema will have had multiple seasons around 30 goals. Probably a fuckton others too. 


We are aiming to be one of the best teams in the world, right? It's not an unreasonable ask to want a forward who can reliably hit around 30 goals a season (I'll accept 25 in a down year).

Maybe Martinelli can become that. Doubt it, but who knows?",Arsenal,Yes,jalv2hc,t1_jalukyh
"Newcastle didn't even set up to do that.  We pushed them back in to their box.

What Dyche did in the away fixture was the first time someones set up a low block and succeeded with it on purpose.   We then dismantled it yesterday.

crisis over.",Arsenal,Yes,jandejg,t1_jancmnl

Tavares has no future at our club. His decision making and defending is far below our standards for a fullback. And we do not use wingbacks as well.

Saka was immense as usual, always seems to score important goals to put us ahead and break deadlocks (reminds me of what Mane did for Liverpool a few seasons back).

On a side note - what are everyone's thoughts on the long term implications of the way Saka gets kicked about coupled with the sheer number of games he plays? Saw the stat about him appearing in 66 consecutive PL games and whilst that is testament to his durability and consistency I do worry for him. We've seen young players get run into the ground like that before (without being kicked from pillar to post as Saka is).

Is this a serious cause for concern for us going forward or am I reading too much into it? I know this point gets brought up a fair amount but I think I just need reassurance (or cause for more concern) from some fellow Gooners.

"Amidst all the Tierney exit rumours, do others have the same intuition as me that, from a squad building perspective, it makes much more sense to bring Tierney into the fold than sell him?

I always thought that the sensical next step, from a squad building perspective, was trying to identify a younger RB with the potential to invert as well as Zinchenko does on the left. 

That then creates variation in our FBs - with Zinchenko/Tierney as options on the left and White/RBnchenko on the right - to match the variation in our options on the wing (ESR/Martinelli/Trossard on the left have very different profiles and may suit different full back profiles. And on the right, we're rumoured to be targeting a new  RW to back up Saka who, like Trossard, may present a very different profile to the starter ahead of him)

In this squad, Tomiyasu would compete with Ben White for the starting spot while mentoring the understudy, play as a defensive LB/RB against specific opponents, and provide emergency cover at CB

I haven't seen anyone that can spray short and long passes with such precision since Cesc. Think Cesc lite in terms of passing but he can do it with his left and right foot, add in a lot more defensive tenacity and ability to get out of a press, and you can Zubimendi.  
  
For people who are unfamiliar with his game, go watch his highlights against United in OT. Made Fred look like he should be playing non-league football.

It's clear that we have a bunch of attacking midfielders that thrive centrally and don't (yet) have the hardworking box to box qualities  required of our 8s - Ode is the only one who has successfully adapted. Trossard, ESR and Vieira would thrive centrally in a 3-1 or 4-1 attack, more so than trying to fit them on the wing, up front or in the 8 position. I also think Jesus could be even better in that hole behind the striker, since he plays almost like a hardworking false 9 and has inconsistent finishing.

Vieira doesn't seem to be that, those Bernardo Silva comparisons seem to be based on nothing other than the fact he's small, Portuguese and left footed.

"Hopefully we make a nice profit on them to be honest. Tavares looks like a great wingback if he can become more consistent. We should be looking for €21m-25m.

Lokonga will probably come good in a double pivot. Spent too long on our bench. A full season loan would have done wonders for his pricetag. He doesn't fit our system currently though. Hopefully Palace want to keep him and we can get £30m.",Arsenal,Yes,jaguozs,t1_jagtelb
"We haven’t done either. 

What are you on about",Arsenal,Yes,jagueqh,t1_jagtelb
"Xhaka does not defend as much as people make out. He can do the double pivot role, but the reason he basically has no cards this season is because he just doesn't tackle as much. He makes less tackles and interceptions than Maddison.

It's more about pressing, positioning and doing the hard work than throwing in tackles etc. Get back into the box to clear the ball out and then run the length of the pitch to get back into the opposition box. Stopping transitions with tackles and interceptions is what Zinchenko and Partey do.

What I'd suggest is, we want a midfielder who will defend from the front and press, and can run all day. Someone who is a hard worker, but also creative and has a few goals. Someone with similar temperament to Odegaard, but can play a little deeper if required. It'd be nice if they were a good ball carrier, we'd probably sacrifice some of Ødegaard's passing for ball carrying for the LCM role as it's nice to have a slightly different profile. Barella would be my choice.",Arsenal,Yes,jagw7sk,t1_jagsyz4
"I think Vieira can do it tbh. Just needs coaching. You don’t have to be an exceptional defender to defend in the middle bank of a 4-4-2 block. Especially if you’re next to an adept defensive midfielder like TP. Only way for him to learn is to gain match experience in the role. 

People overestimating the severity of this. Cazorla did it, Ramsey did it, Pep converted B. Silva to play there who was originally a wide creator. You can go on",Arsenal,Yes,jagtx74,t1_jagsyz4
"I would really like to see ESR get a run of games in 8 or 10. I just would like to see him operate in the midfield for my own personal gain. So, possibly not in a title hunt. But ESR banging in an 80th minute thunderbolt from an Ode sub to win the Europa Final would be OK",Arsenal,Yes,jagv0kc,t1_jagsyz4
"As another commenter said, he really doesn’t do a lot of “actual” defending there. He mostly just stands in the right positions to block out passing lanes but even that part has been lacking a bit lately (watch Villas second goal, Jorginho has to cover two players cause Xhaka is out on the wing for some reason). I’d trust Vieira and ESR to do that job to a comparable level at least. 

Where those two would struggle to replace him would be in aerial duels, especially when Partey is out cause Jorginho doesn’t do a lot in the air. ESR is deceptively tall tough, probably about the same size as Xhaka, if he starts to impose himself more in duels he could be almost perfect for the left 8 if he regains his form from early last season.",Arsenal,Yes,jagzzfa,t1_jagsyz4

I see your argument. However how many times do u expect us to out up a 442 in defense rather than quick counter attack? I think 90% of the time we will be facing the latter.,Arsenal,Yes,jagueyp,t1_jagsyz4
"We generally have the ball somewhere between 60-80% of any given match; we've even dominated City and Newcastle in that respect. For a significant majority of every match, we're on the ball.

Even off the ball, we're only in that 442 block for a fraction of that fraction of the match-- and a fractional fraction that is shrinking. Defining the role by that sub-fraction seems very odd-- especially given what Arteta said to Xhaka in the summer:

> I spoke to him at the end of the season and said, ‘I need to unlock something in your brain because you’re so comfortable and confident playing in this area [conventional central midfield] that you have forgot that **actually what is going to win us the game is here [in attack] and the team now demands somebody here**, so unless you unlock that I’m going to have to do something about it’.

To put it bluntly, Arteta was telling him we don't win games in that 442 block; we win them in our 235 attacking shape, and that is where he needed to improve to help us-- and did. (For the first 9 matches...)

The final point, to my mind, is even more compelling, and it's one I've made before:

If Arteta could clone Ødegaard, we'd be playing two Ødegaards across the top of our midfield; Xhaka is not benching one of them. If we had that pair of Ødegaards, that 442 block would barely exist off the ball. Whoever inherits that role needs to get close to Ødegaard's standard, not Xhaka's.

Ultimately, the main reason that 442 shape exists is to accommodate Xhaka. He's nowhere near as good at pressing as Ødegaard is, and he's not a good tackler. What he can do is sit back in a space he's told to sit, and be OK-ish in the air. So we give him the smallest possible space to defend, and let him sit there. The passivity of this fractional, momentary role is underscored by just how few defensive actions Xhaka has this season.

Now, as an aside, I agree that this lingering need is part of why Rice is such a good signing-- but that too accentuates the extent to which this is a transitional role. And Rice is a very, very good presser and tackler, so we'll likely see him in a far active role; that  442 block will be even less common with Rice.",Arsenal,Yes,jah91dx,t1_jagsyz4
"Hoping one of Madrid clubs call about him ,both need left backs and can afford his wages",Arsenal,Yes,jah3f26,t1_jah06g1

"The moderation on there has gone to absolute shit. 

Honestly I’ve always thought that poor moderation was reddits Achilles heel. 

At some point admins will need to step in and sort out that mod team. It’s one of the worst on Reddit and that is saying something. 

There’s apparently an enormous amount of infighting amongst them as well.",Arsenal,Yes,jak6oj9,t1_jak1gsg

"Yeah, he is going to win it third time in a row.

Still hope they will share the love and give something to Ode though.",Arsenal,Yes,jal4663,t1_jakvzrm
"It crazy that in olden days we gave it to Bould 91 and Parlour 98 despite Smith winning golden boot in 91 and Bergkamp being at a previously never seen level of individual brilliance in 98.
Now it seems we just give to the star player like some pop idol vote.

I want to see Gabriel win it if he plays every game his two winners against Fulham and Chelsea et. . Saka does not need recognition of his brilliance he will walk away with the young player of the year award, England player of the year etc etc

If we get two good midfielders in the summer Partey has to go. I’m tired of these injuries before big matches,Arsenal,Yes,jaim8mn,t1_jaih4x3
very smart to sell partey now,Arsenal,Yes,jaihiwl,t1_jaih4x3

Both to be fair. Rashford’s form is incredible - United won’t be in top 4 without him.,Arsenal,Yes,jakowbq,t1_jakmmv5
"United are box office, there was love for Liverpool in the run they just had as an old English power rising again but United have a pull with the English that’s unmatched, good or bad. The media typically shines a brighter light on them than reality while the public outside of Manchester, watches in hopes they fail. Either way, we’re all watching and paying attention, that’s why we have this situation. 

It’s the same with the England and/or Brazil Football national team, Lakers, Yankees, Cowboys, England and/or New Zealand rugby, Tiger Woods and so on, love or hate them, people will watch.",Arsenal,Yes,jakqd1b,t1_jakmmv5
"I don't disagree that media will hype up all things United but the comparison you've stated is not the entire picture.

First, PL stats may be similar but in all competitions, Saka has 20 GA in 31 while Rashford has 30 GA in 36.

Second, assists may often be more important than assists in actuality but they don't always get the same hype as goals. I personally don't judge players by either but you can't equate them in hype generation. Rashford has 24 goals while Saka has 11.

And third, the most important part of it all is that Saka is remarkably consistent and amazing throughout the year and he has set high standards for himself. While 75+% (haven't checked the actual number) of Rashford's goal contributions have seemingly come after the world cup. It's this incredible hot streak he's on that is generating all the hype.",Arsenal,Yes,jal0r4b,t1_jakmmv5

I will always think of only one player when I see Diaby anywhere. I remember on the radio after his first few training sessions there was word from the camp it looked like Viera was back on the pitch. That was a career ender.,Arsenal,Yes,jah1cdy,t1_jagyxwa
I'd be surprised if we get an attacker. Don't particularly want a LB either. We've waited too long for a midfielder. I'd love Edu to put 10000% of effort and resources into getting Rice and Caicedo.,Arsenal,Yes,jagzutg,t1_jagyxwa
What about Rice and Alfonso Davies?Partey stays one more year. And a tall striker,Arsenal,Yes,jah1kbg,t1_jagyxwa

"Richarlison does get extra leeway for being Brazilian and a starter in their national team. They probably can’t hope to recoup their whole investment, but I think they should be able to get 40-50M.

"I mean, they'll never not laugh at you. Modesty doesn't mean they won't.",Arsenal,Yes,jak1fj1,t1_jak0z6g

"No of course not, keep laughing.",Arsenal,Yes,jak18v7,t1_jak0z6g
"Think he should stay. Even if he isn't able to recreate the unpredictability and progressing through the middle, he is still valuable as a top LB.

Should sell Partey for other reasons if we get Rice,Arsenal,Yes,jags9uh,t1_jags7ls
"It's not a terrible take. Partey is ageing, has 2 years left on his deal and has a legal situation",Arsenal,Yes,jagsj6t,t1_jags7ls
"Hey now, I've been saying it since before those 2 Jorginho games.",Arsenal,Yes,jagvj8o,t1_jags7ls
Absolutely sell him if we get Rice and Caicedo,Arsenal,Yes,jagyixh,t1_jags7ls
"The issue with Partey has never been his quality, it’s his fitness. He cannot make it through a season and we need someone more reliable.",Arsenal,Yes,jagt0up,t1_jags7ls
"Well we kinda have to make a decision on him now because of his contract. Do we give him >250k for 3+ years? If we get Rice, I don't think that's the correct call",Arsenal,Yes,jaguj6y,t1_jags7ls
"People are looking at what has become of fabinho and thinking about the future. I don't think we should sell partey this summer but he should certainly be moved on by summer 2024 I'd say. Cannot see him in the long term future of this club.

I hope ESR does. I think Saka will be too good to keep. City or Madrid. Ode retiring would be fine. Prop him on a stick and let him play through balls. Marti will be too good to keep. He could go anywhere in a few years. I hope either Gabriel or Saliba remain solid and stay for the next 5 years. I think we will play Ramsdale until he declines or a world GK is available. I hope White stays solid and makes another 5 6 years as a squad player. Anyone decent squad members I hope we keep for 2-3 years. I think we will win trophies with this group.,Arsenal,Yes,jagwwjg,t1_jagv9x2

"I am certainly a bit concerned about how he is bullied without “protection” from the refs. I expected it to be worse than it was today. Going forward, of course we would like a serviceable talent to eat some o those minutes and give him a break. We gave fast Gabi a look in garbage time today which seems promising, and I still have hopes for Reiss in some near-term smaller moments. But from now until summer, I suspect Saka is gonna have to carry the load and we hope his history of fitness continues. To think he could/should maintain that expectation for years to come is absurd though. I trust our people to recognize a solution must be found though. Until then, let the kid rip and hope for the best.",Arsenal,Yes,jakr1ce,t1_jakjx3q

i think the price is a bit steep. he’s obviously very good but 80+ million if they stay up. if they go down 100% we should go for him but there might be better alternatives for the money it’ll cost if west ham stay up,Arsenal,Yes,jai3ptk,t1_jai1gq8

He is a nasty piece of shit and he will end up seriously injuring an opponent and it’s all so predictable and preventable. Refs review every game at PGMOL collectively and discuss decisions together. The refs must see the pattern in his play and can prevent a series injury by targeting him. The next time he does someone send him off and keep sending him off until he learns.

This is exactly why versatility in the squad is so important, and why Tomi would stay even if Tierney asks to leave: he can play either FB position.

"when KT plays our LB holds the width in the front five, pushing the LW into the inside channel and leaving the LCM to support our 6 in the middle of the park

when Zinchenko plays the width is held by our LW (more natural position for Gabi), the LCM is the inside channel of the front 5 (better opportunity for rotation with other forward, less defensive responsibility) and our LB supports our 6 in the middle (more technical ability, closer to area they have to defined / able to pressure counter attacks)

idk if that’s a ‘tweak’ or a different system entirely, but the results in both setups speak for themselves.",Arsenal,Yes,jah5xpc,t1_jah31d2
"I remember the speech people here gave me when I told them if we signed Raphinha, he'd displace someone in the XI( most likely Martinelli). 

It was this obvious with KT too the moment Arteta insisted that Zinchenko was a LB. Some of us were trying to make a case for KT by claiming Zinchenko would be a CM. Copium, if you may. 

So, why say all this.

A better player is a better player. These things of ""game X is for Y"" is just copium. Imagine we face Dyche Burnely and we bench Jesus for say, Weghorst.

"Genuinely no idea what everyone sees with Tierney, he's been gash every time he's played this season. He's ridiculously one footed so when he's on the touchline he either pumps it down the wing or passes back to the centre back cause he can't pass it inside with his right.

His defending is pretty average, physically nowhere near the same player, never cuts out cross field passes either, just spins around like a lost child.

Then finally, his crossing is crap. They're always flat with bo whip on them so the vast majority of the time they hit the first man. Zinchenko is a better crosser than him too.

"I think it sailed the moment we moved on Vieira: not because they're similar players, of course, but because we chose to go in a different direction. We chose a development project of a wingfielder over a more conventional CM improvement.

It's possible we might throw him a line and haul him in on a free, but unless we made no other midfield signings, he'd need to be prepared to accept a rotational role in the squad. He'd offer something different than Rice as an 8, certainly, but he wouldn't start over him there.",Arsenal,Yes,jahcnrv,t1_jahab8c
"I don’t rate him mainly because our midfield is probably the slowest/least mobile area of the pitch already. I don’t think adding Tielemans who isn’t know for his pace, athleticism or mobility helps that at all.

"If he's free I could see it possibly.

We obviously had interest but equally didn't want to pay anything like what Leicester wanted so maybe we see what the plan was in the summer.

"First of all, KT has played LB, LWB and LCB for us, so please explain how a man who can play several positions can be ""one dimensional"".

Second, maybe I just dreamt all this, but was he not our only attacking outlet in the beginning of Arteta's reign?  He'd overlap, Auba would cut inside and Laca would drop into the 10.  We won an F.A. Cup during that time and the following season our top 4 push unravelled because he an Partey were injured.  Doesn't sound like he let us down.

Third, tell me who was better than him at LB for Arsenal during his time until Zini showed up?   Because the overwhelming consensus from our fans, generally speaking, was that he was our guy, and whenever he was injured we missed him.  Zini joined and the inverted role completely changed the situation, unless you can explain it differently.

Genuinely interested to hear how you arrived at your conclusion because it is almost the exact opposite of anything I can recall about his time here.",Arsenal,Yes,jagt0kz,t1_jagskuw
"By letting us down you mean for injured? And you're comparing to Zinchenko. Who is justbas injury prone.

He's not 1 dimensional. Also having 1 dimensional players to round out your squad is fine. Especially when no one else does that 1 thing regularly. It's called tactical flexibility. Liverpool in their pomp had room for guys like Ox and Origi.",Arsenal,Yes,jagup49,t1_jagskuw
"I’m confused as to why people act as if Zinchenko can only underlap. Pretty certain the winning goal against Utd came from him overlapping on the LHS.

He is simply more versatile for our system. And despite his deficiencies in defense, his on the ball ability makes him more suited to our system.

I don’t think this means Tierney is a bad player and I disagree with the assertion that he ‘let us down’ but it makes perfect business sense to sell him.",Arsenal,Yes,jagtw5a,t1_jagskuw

he's amazing for his age but between them, ESR, Patino and Rice if we get him will give us more collectively than what Bellingham will...Patino's potential is incredible and ESR can absolutely still become a Croydon KDB...and these guys are Arsenal boys and more likely to reject advances from other clubs

"I know there is emotional attachment to him as he came through the club and has shown a lot but without a doubt yes. 

Prior to this season I stated the unpopular opinion that he's our most sellable asset for a decent fee and wasn't really a key starter for us and has had injury issues in the past, if we needed to raise more funds to make an important signing I would have let him go. 

Although now I would say it's slightly different as we are unlikely to get a big fee for him after being injured for so long where it would be worthwhile.",Arsenal,Yes,jai1tk6,t1_jahybp3

"AFAIK, there is no solid underpinning for foot-related advantages with CMs the way there is with CBs (which is itself often overstated, but does exist).

The short answer is that your dominant foot does offer different angles on either side, but that Arteta doesn't really want rigidly defined positions there; he's also clearly fine with playing two relatively left-footed players across the top of our midfield. Ideally they'd both be fully two-footed, but it's not a huge deal.

Think about that ball Ødegaard played to Martinelli against Brighton, and where he was when he played it. That's the kind of fluidity Arteta wants. He gets most annoyed when our attack becomes static. He'd love nothing better than to see Ødegaard threatening one set of angles on our right, then to have him pop up on our left, offering a different set of threats, with, say, ESR now operating on the right with Saka.

The people who want to see ESR at RCM and Ødegaard at LCM *will* get what they want-- at least momentarily.",Arsenal,Yes,jahaxyk,t1_jah9opw

"Zinchenko inverted gimmick will last as long as Arteta lasts at this club. That gimmick is what allows us to dominate possession and pin down teams. 

Systems are bigger than players, an polished Tavares in the future will be an asset to an team like Chelsea/Tottenham but not for us cause we dont have wing back system similarly we no longer have an traditional LB system hence an traditional LB in Tierney is not suited to our system. 

Martinelli/Trossard are expected to maintain width cause that allows us to have more control in midfield since they essentially pull opponent defense along with them, narrow it down and we can be pressed swifter and higher chances of turnover and counter, it's not for nothing that we heard our coaches shout at Trossard to maintain width. So we will always have that width and traditional Lb bombing down the left and crossing isnt part of our plan.

When was the last time any team in premier league relied on lb/rb bombing down and crossing as an outlet for goals? Nketiah/Jesus aren't such strikers anyway.",Arsenal,Yes,jah6fi0,t1_jah022r
"""Zinchenko inverted gimmick"" lmao. I just find it so strange and funny that people offer tactical analysis here as if they know better than Arteta. Ignoring the other issue that Tierney definitely doesn't want to be 3rd choice LB playing 4 PL games.",Arsenal,Yes,jah11mu,t1_jah022r
"I'd definitely want to keep him, but he is one of very few sellable assets who wouldn't be near irreplaceable.

The issue is where he fits into the attacking 235 -he's always going to be wide left, which isn't a problem, except that it means both the LW and LCM are naturally attacking the left half space. Easy solution is that the LCM drops into the left side of the 3 rather than the front line, except that means neutralising B2B Xhaka and putting him in the kind of position he has traditionally been vulnerable in. This rigidity gets worse when Nketiah is central and not rotating with the LW like Jesus and Trossard do. Someone in the team needs to play that role in the 3, and the only good options on the left are Zinchenko and then Tomi.

The people who say there is no place for a traditional LB are wrong, but we don't really have the midfield personnel to allow it unless we play Zinchenko at LCM with KT at LB, and starting both is a huge risk. And KT's best offensive attribute is rinsing someone on the outside and pinging in a cross, but we don't have the kind of CF or midfield runners that can get on the end of those, so it isn't worth changing things to fit him in, as good as he is.",Arsenal,Yes,jah5vea,t1_jah022r

Where are you playing him?,Arsenal,Yes,jagnmgt,t1_jagned8
Why do you people insist on these comments?,Arsenal,Yes,jagnpw4,t1_jagned8
"I just don't see it.

Our base 433 is already plenty flexible.",Arsenal,Yes,jahrojb,t1_jahpnmu
"Took us two years to get to where we are, and for no obvious reason why should we change it? What are the benefits in doing so?",Arsenal,Yes,jahvbha,t1_jahpnmu
"Not sure where you are coming from here.  

I don't understand how a 4-2-3-1 would create an opportunity for any of those players.  You'd be taking away an advanced MF position and turning to a double pivot. 

The other formation is even less likely.",Arsenal,Yes,jahs7be,t1_jahpnmu
"3-5-2 (3-1-4-2, technically) is the 2nd formation, but is really only utilized when the squad is trailing. 

Outside of preseason, we’ve only seen it at home vs Fulham, after Fulham went up 1-0 in the ~55’; Arteta subbed off Tierney (LB) for Nketiah, playing him centrally with Jesus, shifting Martinelli and Saka to WingBacks. 

We saw the formation a lot more last season, mainly due to the score line, and it was featured heavily in the preseason. This campaign, Arsenal have rarely found themselves behind, and they lack a certain personnel for the system, especially when Jesus went down.

Edit:

Here is a good write up on the tactic from arseblog, published in July

https://arseblog.com/2022/07/tactics-column-two-strikers-the-new-plan-b-for-arteta/",Arsenal,Yes,jahrjra,t1_jahpnmu
This is literally the most offensive post. ESR will play out his contract and will demand to be the first player to sign a lifetime deal. He will be on 50k for the rest of his life. He will then be the first player/manager to win the the Double before retiring to focus on winning back to back CL finals for the first time since 25 26. Don't talk about ESR and funding.,Arsenal,Yes,jagvnxd,t1_jaguije
"How did you read the whole article brev, it’s behind a paywall",Arsenal,Yes,jagv4ih,t1_jaguije
"No I would not. Unless we’re back to the early Emirates days, we should be looking to sell players who are definitely out of favour with Arteta’s system and ESR is still not there.",Arsenal,Yes,jagvz8l,t1_jaguije
What reports?,Arsenal,Yes,jagunvl,t1_jaguije
"I see what you’re saying, but I’m too emotionally invested in seeing him become an all time great no. 10 for us",Arsenal,Yes,jaguuyr,t1_jaguije

We don't need to sell to fund anything,Arsenal,Yes,jagwjnw,t1_jaguije
"He's the best player in the league not on a traditional big 6 team.

It's a gap to anyone else (Caicedo, Mitoma, Paqueta, Maddison, Toney) etc.
I'd say Guimares/Maddison are the closest.",Arsenal,Yes,jahkh79,t1_jahk6wz
have u watched him play ?,Arsenal,Yes,jahlcc6,t1_jahk6wz
"I think I was in that camp but when you look at his stats, it's pretty insane for the team he's in. He has a lot of room to improve too. My faith in who Arteta wants is pretty huge too, if he wants to go all in for Rice. I'm backing it.   


If he becomes English captain too, we just have to stick in the box and watch the penalties for us rack up.",Arsenal,Yes,jahn0eq,t1_jahk6wz
"We don't think, we use facts and stats to evaluate. Rice is the most balance CM just behind SMS, stat by stat u can compare. He ain't god he isn't perfect, but he does everything u expect from a CM, though he excel at none (always the second best or third best in class); BUT he tick every box!!!! And that's his value.",Arsenal,Yes,jahv0dx,t1_jahk6wz
"We don’t knock balls into the box. We don’t overlap and cross. If we do cross it’s usually targeted, normally a cutback more than a cross. 

Trossard small nimble stature and quick feet is what’s needed. 

Arteta doesn’t do “target man”.",Arsenal,Yes,jagro15,t1_jagqsho
Personally I think we need him to drop deep and get around in small spaces in the box. The attack was much more fluid and dynamic against Leicester,Arsenal,Yes,jagr8hb,t1_jagqsho
"sambi will probably be sold

jorg will have fufilled his usefullness and probably be sold

"Genuine question. The odds makers give Odegaard about a 20-25% chance to win PL player of the season. He is the second favorite behind Haaland (then saka, then rashford, then kdb atm)

It's been 13 years since we had a player win it. It's been I believe 5 since we even had someone in team of the season.

If he wins *player of the year,* in the best league on earth, will you issue a mea culpa?",Arsenal,Yes,jahiqok,t1_jahb2mw

"I’m not trying to downplay Jesus’ impact, but he has missed 11 of the 25 games we’ve played now. The majority of our goalscoring improvement has come from our players being coached well and our overall control of games getting better, which is partly coaching and partly personnel. 

But our team hasn’t actually changed all that much since last season - Zinchenko, Saliba, and Jesus are really the only new players in the XI. Two of them are defenders and the other has missed 44% of our league games. I just think it’s pretty impressive what Arteta has managed to do with our existing attacking players - this isn’t just natural development. It’s excellent coaching too.",Arsenal,Yes,jakh2gl,t1_jakg377

When did I say we’ve done anything yet? Take that snark elsewhere.,Arsenal,Yes,jagukta,t1_jagueqh
fair but one thing people do when it comes to suggesting new players is they assume that what the current player brings to the team remains when they’re brought out and the new player will only add on the final missing piece. how much of our domination is because of xhaka looking after the backdoor and allowing the players around him the freedom to play their attacking game? it’s never just as simple as vieira/esr are better attackers than xhaka so lets play them from the start,Arsenal,Yes,jagv4c5,t1_jaguhov

Rice production and research have met unprecedented challenges in recent years. Yield and total production have plateaued for many years in some major producing rice-producing countries while the demand from populations in poverty is ever increasing.

"I dont think Rashford should get more hype for Europa and Carabao performances.

Rashford also doesn't track back and barely progresses the ball.

"Rice, a new 6, a new winger and a new lb is apparently what arteta wants, according to gary Jacobs' article today.

If we are selling tierney and tavares we will need another lb.",Arsenal,Yes,jah034d,t1_jagzutg
"There are reports out today that Arteta wants a winger (likely to replace Nelson, i.e. Saka backup) and a left back. Tierney will leave (I don’t think he wants to be here if he can’t play whenever he’s fit), which is why we will need a left back.

But yeah, we have needed midfielders for a minute. Definitely need two IMO. Rice and Caicedo would be perfect.",Arsenal,Yes,jah03ic,t1_jagzutg
We don’t need a tall striker. We don’t even really need a striker - we have two good ones and another one coming back from loan.,Arsenal,Yes,jah2r6a,t1_jah1kbg

"> I think Saka will be too good to keep.

??? Arsenal will be too good for players to want to leave, that's the manger and the board's goal. Unless it is about ridiculous money, or playing time, don't think any player would want to leave here.",Arsenal,Yes,jagyqy1,t1_jagwwjg
Not sure why Saka will be too good to keep if we start competing with the likes of City and Madrid. Also depends on who is the starter at those teams. Saka is not going anywhere to be a rotational player.,Arsenal,Yes,jagxqmu,t1_jagwwjg
"Yes. There is a user who is the personification of hypocrisy on here. 

He hated that the fanbase was being a dick about Ben White when we signed him so he started hating on Gabriel and Saliba.

He also hates that the fanbase unnecessarily criticizes Nketiah(which imo he's right about) but then he turns and starts hating on Martinelli.

If it goes far post Saka likely has a tap in.

"A lot of people are saying Martinelli played better today because Eddie was dropped for Trossard, but Saka assisted Martinelli’s first goal after he rotated to the right wing, and Eddie literally assisted the second.

"Never said he hadn't considered it.

Not pretending it's a new idea. 

It's an old idea in fact. Taken from how Arteta used to use Tierney.

I think he should bring it back on occasion when the inverted LB isn't working.

You can get the same result from the inverted LB by asking your CM to play as an orthodox CM.",Arsenal,Yes,jah98dz,t1_jah8io4
"in actual matches, ZInchenko functions more like CM especially when we are attacking",Arsenal,Yes,jah82aa,t1_jah4k2m
Yeah the main thing is that when Zinchenko plays we have arguably our best progressive passer on the pitch. There's a reason Arteta never drops him.,Arsenal,Yes,jah8y5c,t1_jah4k2m
We had a numerical overload with the U too we were just bad at getting into midfield.,Arsenal,Yes,jah3ung,t1_jah3eyh
And I said we should use Tierney more. And it's not always a choice between Tierney and Zinchenko.,Arsenal,Yes,jagxtas,t1_jagxq0i
Played the role that didn't suit him. I'm advocating he play his natural game.,Arsenal,Yes,jagycn1,t1_jagy2w9
"You've named basically every style of football. Ten Haag like Arteta is a student of Pep and an advocate of positional play. They follow the same principles. Conte and Howe (atm) are counter punching teams with quick transitions. Klopp is a high press and counter press system, again with an emphasis on quick transitions.",Arsenal,Yes,jagv994,t1_jagv226
"He's mostly been trying to adjust to playing like Zinchenko so his form this season isn't good. I'd simplify his role and get him doing what he does best naturally again.

And it's not necessarily about what he does on the ball. It's his movement off the ball that makes the LW ahead of him effective. You know he's gonna bust his gut to overlap and remove the double team on that wing. He stays high and wide so he stretches the pitch and helps create that half space for the LW. He adds tactical variety by adding the destructive cutback back into our Arsenal of attacking weapons. Too often low blocks have been really comfortable defending because everything is happening in front of them. 

His defending might be average but it's definitely better than Zinchenko. He's superior 1v1 and has better positional sense.",Arsenal,Yes,jagvrmf,t1_jagvdt4
I agree he hasn't looked great this season except in Europa,Arsenal,Yes,jagvps8,t1_jagvdt4
And then we signed Jorginho,Arsenal,Yes,jah4oxc,t1_jah27bp
I would eat a $80 loss which i refuse so yolo,Arsenal,Yes,jaiu1g6,t1_jaitucc
$855,Arsenal,Yes,jaisks1,t1_jaisipa
it’s all good. I clawed some losses back by betting arsenal to win by 3+ and also saka first goalscorer so only lost a few hundred. Also we won and spurs crashed out of the cup so its a good day,Arsenal,Yes,jajqme6,t1_jajpmjz
"He’s out of contract, so definitely free. 

Not sure what (if any) kind of agreement the two sides reached/disgusted in the past 6-18 months of reported interest, but nothing has really changed on Arsenal’s end: they extended Elneny and signed Jorginho, who’s contracts would only overlap with Youri for a year. I think it’s more likely that the leap in the project may see the club look elsewhere, but Tielemans would still be a strong signing for the club, especially on a free.",Arsenal,Yes,jahbxpb,t1_jahb75w
Also because he's 3rd choice. If he was getting as many mins as Tomi I don't think he'd want to leave for Newcastle.,Arsenal,Yes,jagsrqk,t1_jagso18

More of an actor. Hoo-ah.,Arsenal,Yes,jah0j0z,t1_jagzynk
"> Is Pacino more of a defensive midfielder or an attacker?

Well Al-Pacino's most memorable roles have been of either methodical or crazy attackers haven't they. 

Jokes aside Charlie Patino is more of central midfielder, could be an 8 or a 6 or a double pivot player. Not necessarily a final third/final action guy like Fabio Vieira or ESR.",Arsenal,Yes,jah0d8j,t1_jagzynk
"He got a red card due to stupid challenges that's why he didn't play the game before last, don't know why he wasn't in the squad for the last game but could be a lesson from Mick McCarthy. 

Also, Blackpool fans love him what are you talking about.",Arsenal,Yes,jah20it,t1_jah1qh2
"Absolutely, he is also more powerful (or going to be) and faster than Jorginho and has a knack for carrying the ball too. So the potential is immense.",Arsenal,Yes,jah1sgs,t1_jah1k9c
Hopefully so :),Arsenal,Yes,jah0ub6,t1_jah0nxe
Man am i so happy to be wrong hahaha,Arsenal,Yes,jajfw48,t1_jah0nxe
Yet he averages 34.5 PL games a season and played a full championship season before that.,Arsenal,Yes,jahejhx,t1_jaheavk
"Liverpool went to 3 Champions League finals relying on their creative fullbacks. 

My general point is our system won't be unbeatable forever. The team will always need to evolve and having different players who are good at different things is always nice.",Arsenal,Yes,jah9r8h,t1_jah6fi0
I'd there a right way to football. Did Arteta invent it? Or did he maybe copy the same principles some of us were familiar with before Arteta.,Arsenal,Yes,jah3gmk,t1_jah11mu
"Everyone.

 He creates space by being a dummy option. And he can cut back. Or if he gets the ball on the wing the defence will send a player to him = more space for others. And it doesn't have to be a cross to a target man. A low cross into the 6 yard box any good scorer gamble's on. Or he could cut it back and replicate the city dynamic with midfielders running onto the ball. Or he can cross it far post and have Saka poach like Foden does for city backpost.",Arsenal,Yes,jah3dga,t1_jah1gj4
"Who did City cross to when they didn't have Haaland? You don't need 6'7 lampposts as your strikers to cross, it's all about space and timing, catching the opponents by surprise.",Arsenal,Yes,jaha48r,t1_jah1gj4
"So we're just ignoring the fact that Edu consistently fails to get his first targets? And no, Jorginho and Trossard being good doesn't mean that the first statement is wrong.",Arsenal,Yes,jahaww9,t1_jah8nv3
I didn't mention anything about Edu?,Arsenal,Yes,jah8sfy,t1_jah8nv3
I think this guy is more praising how good Rice would be compared to other signings than criticising Edu if we didn't sign him,Arsenal,Yes,jah91mg,t1_jah8nv3
Which Martinez are we talking about,Arsenal,Yes,jahmcyz,t1_jah8nv3
Sorry,Arsenal,Yes,jahcbks,t1_jah9xio

"Arteta's recent presser he was asked whether he wants goals spread around or someone who can score 25 themselves, he said both. 

200m for Rice, a forward like Leao or even Toney and a fullback or two is easily doable.",Arsenal,Yes,jah4bwc,t1_jah3tcu
"That's akin to a rebuild, no Partey no Xhaka.",Arsenal,Yes,jah7mjd,t1_jah6ppj

I have never wanted more to tag someone else's post with 'emphasis mine'.,Arsenal,Yes,jahmm75,t1_jahltap
"Are you saying something remotely positive about Xhaka ? It’s always strange seeing it from you, lovely though lol",Arsenal,Yes,jahvcaw,t1_jahmj9x
"Yeah, people underestimate how much positioning is a factor on how people can play. It's a bit like people saying Trent Alexander Arnold should play in the middle, playing as a full-back allows him so much more time than if he was central. It's the same for Jorginho, playing further back and having time and space to get your head up is a lot different to being expected to make supporting runs or track back from more advanced positions. Also you get way less time on the ball because you're being pressed way more the further up the pitch you are.",Arsenal,Yes,jahqp0p,t1_jahmj9x
"I was there the first time... however without the league it's just 'a' treble, not 'the' treble as Manu themsleves pointed out when liverpool did both domestic and the UEFA",Arsenal,Yes,jajnulb,t1_jajjwgh

"Mainly as striker, I suppose, rotating with Jesus.",Arsenal,Yes,jago5e5,t1_jagnmgt
Why do people in a Reddit forum have opinions that differ from my own,Arsenal,Yes,jagpy34,t1_jagnpw4
Why? What's wrong?,Arsenal,Yes,jago7y0,t1_jagnpw4
"I'd argue we are quite lacking in 8s that truly thrive in the role. Only Ode fits in my eyes. Obviously, we should see further development in Vieira, ESR etc. However, it may ultimately be akin to fitting square pegs through round holes.  


That said, Arteta shows a stubbornness in his ideals and I wouldn't be surprised if we show ruthlessness in the transfer market to reach them.",Arsenal,Yes,jahwlew,t1_jahrojb
"There is always natural evolution in the game and the best teams show their own tweaks too. The other two best teams in the league use 4-2-3-1 currently. Not that we should be copying them but with the squad we have, some players would certainly fit into it better.",Arsenal,Yes,jahxsi7,t1_jahvbha
"What don't you understand? Trossard has said himself he is a second striker type and his qualities are clearly suited in tight central areas, in which he can pull out impossible shots and short passes. He would 100% look better in the hole behind the striker than out by the touchline as a winger.   


ESR and Vieira are also central attacking mid types and haven't really shown the workrate, nor the defensive nous, to take over Xhaka or Ode's position. In a 4-3-2-1, the 10 doesn't have to drop so deep so they can play more like pure attacking midfielders.  


The 3-2-4-1 is a formation that Man City have used this season to break down deep blocks. It's one you probably wouldn't use in an even match up but it does provide the extra attacking player in games you expect to dominate.",Arsenal,Yes,jahvnno,t1_jahs7be
"Yeah, I remember seeing it a lot last season too. We could feasibly use it now with Nketiah and Trossard next to each other and maybe we have and I just haven't been paying attention.   


It is the equivalent of throwing extra forwards on when the opponents are trying to hold out the rest of the game in a deep block. Would look very different from the start of a game.   


Still different to what I'm suggesting though. You see Man City use 4-2-3-1 with Alvarez behind Haaland. In games they know they will control possession against a deep block, they run 3-2-4-1. We haven't played with a 10 since ESR days I think. Ode's inclusion in the team was the start of the move to 4-3-3.",Arsenal,Yes,jahtd11,t1_jahrjra
[deleted],Arsenal,Yes,jaguuxo,t1_jagunvl
He doesn't improve the players around him. That is a massive measure for greatness for me and he is not doing that.,Arsenal,Yes,jahl6u6,t1_jahkh79
Yes. But when you watch him play does he improve the players around him? Because I don't see him doing that at all.,Arsenal,Yes,jahlkhv,t1_jahlcc6
"I don't think we sell Joringho, he just takes over the El Neny role. I think Xhaka will rotate out but also be a commonly used sub. He could even become the backup LB in the system we play now, he is good cover for Zinny. I wonder about Partey, his injury record really kills us. He can't be first choice anymore I think, but you can't really keep him around as a squad / backup player.",Arsenal,Yes,jaht2rh,t1_jahpv2u
"I do see us selling Sambi. Don't see us selling Jorginho or Partey. Partey will only be 30 and still have 2 years left on his deal. Arguably one of our best players. Could see him not able to play depending on what happens with the legal situation. Assuming we sell Sambi and keep Partey and Jorginho our midfield depth would be:

Partey, Jorginho, Xhaka, Odegaard, Rice, new MF #2, ESR, Fabio. Also have Elneny for emergency depth and Patino (who I see getting loaned out again). ESR and Fabio can play on the wing, but they still won't get enough minutes to help them develop.",Arsenal,Yes,jahtwe4,t1_jahpv2u
Didn’t we sell giroud for Auba?,Arsenal,Yes,jagxaax,t1_jagw1rw
"Sideways move tbh. Laca was neither an upgrade or a downgrade. 

Giroud is like Emi Martinez. Everyone remember the big moments but forgets what he’s like across a full season. He’s inconsistent as fuck and has huge dry spells wheres he completely ineffective. Wasn’t good enough for Arsenal, wasn’t good enough for Chelsea",Arsenal,Yes,jagw97j,t1_jagw1rw
Is selling Giroud for Auba,Arsenal,Yes,jagw4bh,t1_jagw1rw
"Average passing range, poor shot, extremely one footed so very limited passing angles and much easier to press than a Bernardo Silva say. Doesn't mean he's a bad player, just don't think he's actually that good.",Arsenal,Yes,jahdhcg,t1_jahcxxx
Nope. Don't think he's even top three Arsenal player of the season. Saka & Partey easily take one & two. Then White & Gabriel. He might make the top five depending on how Jesus does when he's back.,Arsenal,Yes,jahjqef,t1_jahiqok
"Did you watch the game yesterday? He was shocking in the first half, pretty much all the issues I have with him came to the surface. He was brilliant in the second half... once we were two up",Arsenal,Yes,janrrnt,t1_janp76j

"I feel like you've responded without even reading my comment. We can forego the back door looking cause some teams don't even really look to attack us. They're playing for draws.

Also we have 3 rapid CBs looking to sweep up in behind as well. Xhakas defensive activity in this role isnt that high. He also plays ahead of the ball. He really doesn't do that much covering.",Arsenal,Yes,jagvfow,t1_jagv4c5

I hope that we will compete with City continuously and a move to city wouldn't be a career upgrade. I think by 28 he will get big pay day contract.

"So, you correctly assess that Arteta plays him as an inverted wing back, and Tierney cannot play that role. Why do you think Arteta would ever change his system to fit an inferior player? Arteta clearly puts a heavy emphasis on positional play in his training drills, and that would all get thrown out of the window if Tierney gets to play his natural role.

"All this stuff you are listing doesn't seem to be anything Arteta really cares about or values. Tomiyasu has started the same amount of games as Tierney at LB in the PL. He is also injury prone, and on one of the highest salaries in our team for someone who doesn't play. 

Also forgetting the most important part. The guy 100% will want to leave after playing 4 PL games so far. 

I agree with u/burtspangles. He's overrated because he's a great, normal guy.",Arsenal,Yes,jagwq1p,t1_jagvrmf
"What's the point of him holding the width when he does nothing with it? I'd rather Martinelli be wide because he can actually go both way. If we're keeping a player because of where he stands, something is going wrong. Zinchenko could easily stay wide if asked to.

Tierney is slightly better 1v1, but not by much as he's massively fell off in that area. He gets walked past almost as much as Zinchenko now. Zinchenko is more active in our counterpress, he & Xhaka always first to react and win it back.",Arsenal,Yes,jagw7nv,t1_jagvrmf

That said, ESR and Vieira are perhaps closer to being able to do what Ødegaard does (speaking generally rather than specifically) than it might seem-- in part because Ødegaard is closer to a wingfielder than it might seem: much like both of them, he played out wide a good deal when he was on loan in Spain, and still, drifts wide regularly in switching with Saka. He's mastered the limited CM aspects of our wide/advanced 8 roles more than they have, but those are both a surprisingly small part of that role, and well within the abilities of ESR and Vieira.",Arsenal,Yes,jahxpm8,t1_jahwlew
I can’t read it because it’s pay walled. However I have been thinking lately that ESR is a bit surplus to requirements. Or he would be if Vieira comes good.,Arsenal,Yes,jagvdyc,t1_jaguuxo
"While West Ham are a shambles now, that's not on Rice.

He helped drag them into the EL two seasons ago, and the Conference League last season-- both of which are good results for them. Saying he 'doesn't' and implying he can't raise a club's level are just wrong.",Arsenal,Yes,jahlvl6,t1_jahl6u6
He had Soucek looking like an absolute baller for two seasons,Arsenal,Yes,jahn6zu,t1_jahl6u6

Odegaard this year is just world class in passing/creation stats
https://fbref.com/en/players/79300479/Martin-Odegaard

For combined shots/key passes p90, he's at peak Ozil levels. Ozil had 2 seasons between 5-5.0 combined. Odegaard is there. 
De Bruyne is usually over 6, but City just have had a better team on average.

Usually only 2 or 3 players in the PL get to 5+. Kane and De Bruyne almost always, Ozil/Sanchez in their good years but no one else consistently does.",Arsenal,Yes,jahez5v,t1_jahdhcg

"i read your comment, i'm saying xhaka looking after the backdoor is part of the reason we dominate and teams don't look to attack us. vieira is a much bigger weak link teams would look to exploit than xhaka is so that would encourage them to play through him. teams target vieira when he comes on because he weighs 5 stone soaking wet so if he's playing the full game with defensive responsibility baked into his role how often are teams (for example everton tonight with onana) going to put someone on him and force a turnover?",Arsenal,Yes,jagvurc,t1_jagvfow
"Because if we tried to sell him after he just had a great season, it'd tell the world that Arsenal think he is.",Arsenal,Yes,jaioupk,t1_jaiogkp
I am not 100% on the current situation but there's basically a bunch of controversy about it and most countries where it's intended to be used haven't allowed it to be grown. I think part of it is that the international laws around GM stuff operate a bit like the legal highs law in the UK where any new thing is automatically banned until it proves itself to be safe.

"ESR is fantastic and I’m excited for his return but he’s not really a winger - not a right winger anyway, which is what we need. I see him as more of a versatile attacking midfielder than anything.

Rice is an absolute physical beast. I’m so surprised to see this take haha,Arsenal,Yes,jaigkuj,t1_jai4mb4
"Nah man, physically he's one of the top midfielders in the league.

There are few players in midfield of his height, pace, strength and engine. 

He's seemingly immune to injury and fatigue too. 

In the top 6 midfielders, only Rodri, fabinho, zakaria, mctominay are bigger. 

Statistically he's one of the best in terms of winning duels. Nobody is bullying rice right now. 

How long that lasts I dunno, if you see something that makes you think that won't last, fine. 

But the lad is a machine right now. 

And btw who needs him in his 30s? Even if we have him for 5 years he'll be 29 by then lol.",Arsenal,Yes,jaicz3z,t1_jai4mb4
"He does not stand out in any of the criterion, but he come close in almost all metrics, second best or third best in class. He is a MF that tick every box, and IMO only behind SMS. Moreover he is younger AND does not miss a.game for years!",Arsenal,Yes,jai820o,t1_jai4mb4
"He’s all of those though, yeah sure he’s not 2 meters+ but he’s tall, he’s not rapid but quick for his frame and can carry the ball well, he’s not big Gabi but he can win physical duels vs most midfielders, and he’s actually very technical too.

I’m not 100% convinced either, think there might be better options for the insane fee West Ham want. But you haven’t watched him enough if you think he’s none of those things, his strength to me is that he’s kind of a “Jack of all trades” which does make sense since we want our 6 to do literally everything you can imagine in a game of football",Arsenal,Yes,jai83jv,t1_jai4mb4
Off to the kebab shop?,Arsenal,Yes,jahb4h9,t1_jaha21w

Arteta trusted him plenty. He will also have the best assessment of KT than any of us. He just prefers Zinna to him. I think Tomi subs on the left could be about testing the waters because KT wants to leave... This is happening isn't it :(,Arsenal,Yes,jahgbgs,t1_jahe3cj

"Xhaka vacates the midfield more often than not to give Zinchenko room to operate. Vs Man City we built in 2-4 with Xhaka as an orthodox LB. We simply ask him to hold his starting position.

The form of the entire left side suggests otherwise....,Arsenal,Yes,jagye7s,t1_jagy3pb
Nah let's change the system which has us 1st in the league for Tierney to whip crosses into 5'8 Trossard,Arsenal,Yes,jagzf5z,t1_jagypmx
"He does already. He makes minor tweaks like this basically every game.

And because you need a squad of engaged players to sustain a league title charge and compete in multiple fronts.

Positional play isn't rigid. We've already seen Arteta play 4231, 433, 343 and 352 with the same positonal play principles.

Another benefit is you get found out over time. Look at pep. He's been at the top for so long because hes always tinkering to stay ahead of the game.",Arsenal,Yes,jagz21l,t1_jagypmx
What does that have to do with the price of eggs?,Arsenal,Yes,jagvvcl,t1_jagvjvi
Shaw has been inverting at times this season,Arsenal,Yes,jagvrv4,t1_jagvlex
"It would be a mistake to think we shouldn't overlap. And it definitely isn't part of positional play to say that.

He was overrated at points but he's definitely underrated now.",Arsenal,Yes,jagws9v,t1_jagwq1p
"Basic concept of spacing. If you don't attack with the full width of the pitch then they defence doesn't have to defend wide. Martinelli has been increasingly isolated and ineffective wide.

And yet Zinchenko hasn't as the form of the entire left side continues to fall.",Arsenal,Yes,jagwcog,t1_jagw7nv

"I wouldn’t call either unspectacular; definitely the type of player’s you need in a squad looking to win trophies.

"> He was getting benched towards the end of Appleton's tenure

I mean that could be down to the manager trying new things to turn the results around. McCarthy is also a pragmatic manager.

Besides he is a young player so definitely needs to develop more. I never said we should ""rely"" on him, just that as a squad option he could be a candidate based on the rest of the season and pre-season with Arsenal.",Arsenal,Yes,jah2j96,t1_jah27gg
Right. Any footballing reasons? lol,Arsenal,Yes,jahf35s,t1_jahesd2
"No one has yet explained in footballing terms why this current system doesnt work with that variation. 

And again I've not said Tierney should start every game. I just said some games suit his skillset better.

Jorginho dives in because of his lack of speed. His only chance of ever stopping an attack is diving in one the passer.

"Peak Ozil levels or not, it doesn't match up with the eyes. I routinely see him in great pockets of space, runners either side and he plays passes behind Saka,  hits weak efforts than roll into the keepers hands or overhits back post crosses into Xhaka or Martinelli. 


He's a good player, not world class.",Arsenal,Yes,jahfpn4,t1_jahez5v
"Because we're the most or second most dominant team in the league and with his intelligence he routinely gets into good positions to make killer passes. He normally fucks it up but he's always in good positions. Vieira never gets into good positions when he plays, I wish he did because he's a way better final third player than Odegaard.",Arsenal,Yes,jahffx7,t1_jahefau
"Come on, Saka and Partey have clearly been better for us this season. From the period where Jesus was fit he was also above Odegaard. Gabriel and White are arguable because all three have had bad games. I can't believe I forgot Zinchenko, he'd be above Odegaard too for me. Like I said, he might make the top five.",Arsenal,Yes,jahl5xq,t1_jahk74z
"Did you see the bids we made in January? Were not being blocked from buying.

And see how everything shakes out. You hold onto leverage by not being desperate to sell. We should reassess him early pre season and see where he's at. And decide after that. Could be a loan, could be a sale, could be integration. It's not a decision that we benefit from making in March.",Arsenal,Yes,jahdsez,t1_jahcpp1
Like 3 months ago with Gabriel? And since then with Saliba? No it’s a bad take,Arsenal,Yes,jaibxuo,t1_jai78ch
I'm not apologising because I still believe he is going to be one of the best in the world? Not hard to grasp why I am not going to apologise. You keep begging for an apology like I am sorry for what I said lol,Arsenal,Yes,jajr2jj,t1_jajqqob
Fair I disagree. His ball retention is excellent as well.,Arsenal,Yes,jagvxb5,t1_jagvurc

What about a squad player that could play on the right and striker. But is tall?,Arsenal,Yes,jah650r,t1_jah57ep
Fair. I just mean when he is in the 28 range he will get a final contract at a European club that is winning trophies. I think if the Kroenke's still run the club in the next 8 years the team will have been recycled for the next youth build.,Arsenal,Yes,jagzrn6,t1_jagzhqk
Well Saka did bully him that one time. But who isn’t bullied by Saka?,Arsenal,Yes,jaif8hr,t1_jaicz3z
I wish I could say that unfotunately the achingly north london hipster that I am means lunch today is sushi,Arsenal,Yes,jahbgdt,t1_jahb4h9

"I dont get this weird thing we've seen also this week with martinelli.

"I hope you’re right lad, I hope you’re right",Arsenal,Yes,jakc1gx,t1_jajs79p
"All your suggestion relate to Zinny's position BUT not Tierney's. U kept saying midfield but u fail to realize Tierney stays in the left most of the time. Plus! Xhaka  just push further up into final third, that's how the numerical overload is created.",Arsenal,Yes,jah5mug,t1_jah5a9k
That has basically everything to do with Xhaka and  perhaps a slight dip in form from Martinelli and practically nothing to do with Zinchenko. Tierney and Martinelli don’t even link up particularly well.,Arsenal,Yes,jah24qc,t1_jagye7s
3 goals between Martinelli and Zinchenko in our last two.... Add in Trossard off the left against Brentford and 4 of our last 9 goals have come off the left.,Arsenal,Yes,jagyl27,t1_jagye7s
"> He does already. He makes minor tweaks like this basically every game.

Minor tweaks in that Ben White will sometimes tuck in as a third CB or push more forward depending on the opposition, however you won't see Saka play as a wide midfielder, nor will you see Odegaard play box to box. They have clear, defined roles on the pitch that Arteta rarely deviates from. Tierney bombing down the left flank as a traditional full back is a deviation too far, imo. 

> Positional play isn't rigid. We've already seen Arteta play 4231, 433, 343 and 352 with the same positonal play principles.

3 at the back is never played anymore unless there's an early red card or Arteta's seeing out the game. The 4231 and 433 distinction is basically just if Xhaka drops deep to help build up play, or he pushes on to create space for Partey and Zinchenko to drive through, it has nothing to do with Tierney, and since Lokonga has been loaned out I've not seen a 4231 played(Maybe the City game at times, but that's debatable). Once again, Arteta seems to prefer optimizing his way rather than develop different playing styles.",Arsenal,Yes,jagzyxb,t1_jagz21l

"If Martinelli is struggling to hold the width, so would Tierney tenfold. He'd literally be a warm body just to occupy space, the Weghorst of left backs.

Having your striker be tall is an insignificant bonus, not something that you should seek out for its own sake.",Arsenal,Yes,jah6i84,t1_jah650r
Wenger would be proud of you.,Arsenal,Yes,jahbxxq,t1_jahbgdt
"like I've said, just go watch. 

Martinelli is not the most forward player when the team is out of possession neither is he in the middle. he's at the touchline for multiple periods and tracking back at the wing. he roams inside sure, but most of his goals aren't in the middle of the box. neither are saka's. or robben's. or Ribery's...

yea, obviously wide players gonna score in the middle from time to time. but in Ronaldo's case it's the opposite, he scored them in the middle most of the time, because that's where he was when his team had possession. he wasn't holding width or touching the touch line.

again, UCL final 08/09 is on YouTube, Ronaldo is the center most of the front and the furthest forward player, up until Fergie decided to put berbatov, tevez, rooney and Ronaldo together in a desperation move 😂

anyways, if Ronaldo was at the touchline holding width and tracking back to defend like a proper winger he wouldn't have as many goals, so comparing him as the same as actual wingers is just wrong imo. same for Messi too btw 


not sure what the point is about odegaard. he's a midfielder, midfielder usually scoring from the... middle.",Arsenal,Yes,jalg4mg,t1_jalapst
"https://reddit.com/r/Gunners/comments/11exzxp/march_01_2023_daily_discussion_transfers_thread/jah4vpa

You asked a question about the midfield. I answered.",Arsenal,Yes,jah5vbk,t1_jah5mug
It's not necessarily about link up. it's about spacing. It gives Martinelli more space to receive in dangerous areas. Also it would be Zinchenko coming in for Xhaka too.,Arsenal,Yes,jah2mt3,t1_jah24qc
Doesn't change my point. Bar the last game they've been poor for a month minimum.,Arsenal,Yes,jagyq60,t1_jagyl27
"Read your 1st sentence again and tell me why it's impossible for that to be done for Tierney 😂😂😂

What does saying we use 352 to see out games sometimes change. My point it it's a system that doesn't compromise Arteta style of play or principles.

Thanks for agreeing. This can all be seen as optimising his style 👍🏿",Arsenal,Yes,jah08ru,t1_jagzyxb
"Tierney is not getting in that United team either. Not technically secure enough, too one footed",Arsenal,Yes,jagw2nn,t1_jagvv5k
Other way round. Could easily be 1A and 1B to prevent us making another transfer we don't have to. I'd be ecstatic if we went big on 2 midfielders as our only signings. Almost every other position has players growing into the role and improving over time.,Arsenal,Yes,jagy7u7,t1_jagxl02
"Well no. It's easier to hold the width as a left footed on the left Vs a right. You're natural movement is into space. And inverted wingers natural movement is into more pressure.

And as stated. The design needs improvement as indicated by the poor form of Xhaka and Martinelli. What we're doing on the side right now needs improvement.",Arsenal,Yes,jagx2r4,t1_jagwu94
You think I'd be wasting my good luck in Arsenal injury news and not betting if I was lucky? Bozo,Arsenal,Yes,jah7iq5,t1_jah6rl2
Didn't really do anything. Occasionally hot injury and lineup news before officially announced. Would sometimes share it on this sub,Arsenal,Yes,jahay0r,t1_jah9wco
Sorry I didn't see you edited your comment. Who you thinking of? I would be suprised if we bought Caicedo and Rice like was rumoured in Jan but wouldn't mind that sort of route.,Arsenal,Yes,jahgiks,t1_jahg679
He did play 35 PL games last season though. I've heard of his possible injury issues but was was wondering what people thought tactically.,Arsenal,Yes,jahjhn1,t1_jahgpdy
Done it multiple times.,Arsenal,Yes,jah9bof,t1_jah8vs1
Don't think City's FB put in a lot of crosses too! Walker 18; Lewis 5; Ake 8; and Cancelo 45 ( as an inverted FB!).,Arsenal,Yes,jahhnj1,t1_jahhcks
"You're coming at me and you don't even know what Edu does, fair enough.",Arsenal,Yes,jaiu4tz,t1_jahwuc7
"i believe you. I am not able to assess his speed in this clips. In this clip, he is always in position to make the tackle, so I can't see him chasing down a runner, running to close down gaps and spaces I will need to watch him off the ball, which isn't available here.",Arsenal,Yes,jahu4ii,t1_jahsh4a
U don't buy 2 at the same time! Unless u decide to offload the two KEY players at the same time.,Arsenal,Yes,jahhtzz,t1_jahdidb
"I see, the misunderstanding was from me I place some users here in anti-player camps, you included. Pro-Arsenal is more of my vibe 🤝",Arsenal,Yes,jaib8mr,t1_jai3htf
So a career of great vs one 'bad' year. Zinchenko and Partey are our main progressors anyway so the relevance to an Odegaard/Bernardo Silva debate doesn't tally up.,Arsenal,Yes,jahfye6,t1_jahfebp
"If I had three players in our squad to be bearing down on goal and faced with picking the right pass to runners either side or taking a shot themselves, Odegaard wouldn't be in my top 3. Vieira, Smith Rowe, Martinelli, Jesus & Saka all more reliable in those situations. Says it all really.",Arsenal,Yes,jahg932,t1_jahfyqt
"Funny thing is, a lot of the criticisms of him that I have, Arteta alluded to himself in one his press conferences a month or two ago.",Arsenal,Yes,jarwg3o,t1_jargq35
"If a pass is played behind someone, taking them out of their stride, is it a successful pass? (In the context where a pass infront of them would be better?.) Statistically it's a successful pass, reality is it's not.",Arsenal,Yes,jahghdy,t1_jahg5xb
We play 3 6 foot plus CBs..that's the deterrent to long balls. Not the CM who spends most of the game in line with our striker.,Arsenal,Yes,jagwv43,t1_jagwnd7
One tall player that could hold up the ball with his back to goal and contribute passing assists. An ariel threat for 60 mins or 30 at the end that gives the opponent a few thing to think about during long balls and late corners. So a tall play good with his head and can hold up ball and distribute.,Arsenal,Yes,jah7tek,t1_jah6i84

"Understat has shot maps for every player in the league, for the last decade.

So where is the numerical advantage playing Tierney?!!!!  Show me your counting !!! Jesus Christ u keep sidestep everything.,Arsenal,Yes,jah600g,t1_jah5vbk
"I don’t think we need Tierney at LB to put Martinelli into dangerous areas. Zinchenko, and whoever is playing in the 9 can rotate or overlap just fine. Xhaka was doing this well as recently as the United game, so he can do it too. He’s just been off the boil for a few weeks now.",Arsenal,No,jah32q4,t1_jah2mt3
"Martinelli was doing well with jesus, we just need him back",Arsenal,No,jahbeu1,t1_jah2mt3
"Lol okay if you say so. We should sack Arteta and Edu and hire you, you seem to think you know best.",Arsenal,Yes,jagyxus,t1_jagyq60
"Yeah, feel like you're going to be disappointed buddy.",Arsenal,Yes,jah0k0r,t1_jah08ru
"Sorry I don't understand what you mean in that 1st part. Regardless, he will want to leave, and I'm 99% sure of that. He is a good player who we can recoup for more necessary players.",Arsenal,Yes,jagypza,t1_jagy7u7
"Tierney for Zinchenko in any circumstance or any role is not an improvement, that's the issue. Tavares for Zinchenko is more of an 'improvement' in very specific situations, Tierney never.",Arsenal,Yes,jagx6vd,t1_jagx2r4
"I also don’t buy getting both of those players. I think Rice and then someone under the radar for the left 8 role who won’t command a top fee. 

Not saying Vieira style player, but that type of purchase where the fee is smaller in comparison to someone like Caicedo and Madders.",Arsenal,Yes,jahgv9n,t1_jahgiks
I have yet to see it.,Arsenal,Yes,jah9qu6,t1_jah9bof
Ironic really,Arsenal,Yes,jajo5i8,t1_jaiu4tz
Well we shall see what we do in summer but I’d be very surprised if we only bought one midfielder.,Arsenal,Yes,jahhxy9,t1_jahhtzz
"Odegaard averages 10% more progressive passes per game than Partey.

Odegaard is higher up the pitch, and again, creates more than double the shot creation actions of either player, and does so at a world class level.",Arsenal,Yes,jahg81j,t1_jahfye6
"Vieira?

Jesus christ.

He's literally never done that in his professional career. A sample size of ""believe me bro.""

Odegaard has *routinely* done it and gotten some very good assists from such. (Martinelli vs Pool is the exact scenario you describe)",Arsenal,Yes,jahgdvn,t1_jahg932
"Every player does that so what. You need to understand he makes us tick, he’s our best chance creator this season, Arteta trusts him to be captain, and he’s playing fantastic football. Why can’t you see that?",Arsenal,Yes,jahgt52,t1_jahghdy
"i'm not saying the cm is the deterrent to long balls, i'm saying xhaka is part of the deterrent to being played through. if you can't get through then you go over. if vieira is there instead of xhaka then the option to go through becomes available",Arsenal,Yes,jagx5c3,t1_jagwv43
"You don’t need to be tall to hold the ball up. Jesus has some of the best hold up play in the world and he’s not tall. 

I just don’t think being tall is all that important. It’s not something we should be specifically looking for as part of our recruitment strategy.",Arsenal,Yes,jah9wce,t1_jah7tek
"i mean, you can go right now check, say, saka v haaland's shotmap for this season and tell me if you can spot the difference. now which ones looks closer to Ronaldo's? easy answer...

more importantly, like I've said, he was literally in the middle of the front 3 on a UCL final with man u. wasn't the first time either. def shouldn't be some revelation.

saka is a de facto winger. last time Ronaldo played as a actual one was prob 2006 world cup",Arsenal,Yes,jalhwn7,t1_jalgla0
"If Xhaka drop down, where is the numerical advantage? And then. Nketiah drop down? 


Christ who is going to receive Tierney's crosses?",Arsenal,Yes,jah64ij,t1_jah600g
Why haven't we done it for like 2 months then. Sometimes changing personnel is the more natural solution then forcing someone to play like someone they're not.,Arsenal,Yes,jah3nrz,t1_jah32q4
Don't be a baby. Suggesting a tactical tweak doesn't mean I wanna sack everyone. Being top doesn't mean we're perfect and don't make errors.,Arsenal,Yes,jagz4h3,t1_jagyxus
Doesn't mean I'm wrong,Arsenal,Yes,jah1eda,t1_jah0k0r
Players have tendencies as well as attributes. Tierney tendencies suit some scenerios more than Zinchenkos.,Arsenal,Yes,jagxcxs,t1_jagx6vd
You've seen it and replied several times.,Arsenal,Yes,jah9ttn,t1_jah9qu6
"Vieira's a way more talented final action player. If you look at Vieira's goal contributions this season in a highlight reel, they rival Odegaard's in terms of quality and one's played way more minutes. 

Vieira's issue is the intangibles, and it's where Odegaard shines. The intelligence to actually find the spaces to get into those positions, Odegaard does it brilliantly, always find himself in pockets to cock up the final action. Shame really.",Arsenal,Yes,jahhnqh,t1_jahgdvn
"Zinchenko & Partey are way more important to making us tick. Of course he's our best chance creator, Jesus has been injured half the season & Xhaka is our other eight, oh and not to mention, that's literally his primary function in the team. He's a fine player, just a bit limited.",Arsenal,Yes,jahh8jw,t1_jahgt52
I really don't think it's an important factor. They're always gonna play to space before looking to play through a body. We leave plenty of space when we attack.,Arsenal,Yes,jagxb24,t1_jagx5c3
I think a slight height advantage in set piece situations and late in the game would be a plan B. I think it could provide another option. Just a tall option in certain situations. I think we have a creative group. They would probably ping 1 2s off his forehead to recreate the Norwich goal.,Arsenal,Yes,jahapgl,t1_jah9wce
I think T will come good next year and be a fit for the system and play more,Arsenal,Yes,jah45io,t1_jah3nrz
"You could be right in the abstract, but I’m not convinced that Tierney is the answer to our LHS issues.",Arsenal,Yes,jah6pyp,t1_jah3nrz
"U are THE BABY. U failed to see what KT has contributed so far, and failed to answer who benefits from KT crosses?",Arsenal,Yes,jah2f07,t1_jagz4h3
Ahh yes I'm a baby because I don't think the problem is our left back lol.,Arsenal,Yes,jah3jgh,t1_jagz4h3
"Whatever those scenarios are, he does nothing with them because he's so limited.


Good thing the manager agrees with me.",Arsenal,Yes,jagxfy9,t1_jagxcxs
"Nay. I have yet to see any, u keep sidestep without answering any of the question. Example: whare is the numerical advantage playing Tierney, I have yet to see your count.",Arsenal,Yes,jahaeal,t1_jah9ttn
"This is completely wrong. 

Vieira is more of a Bruno Fernandes type. They try riskier passes at a higher percentage than a player like Odegaard. That does not make him better or more talented.

In fact, our fans routinely make fun of Bruno for playing like this! Tifo just did a video on if United can be a top, top team with him and how he functions!",Arsenal,Yes,jahhxrc,t1_jahhnqh
You’re just so out of touch. He’s been one of the best players in the league this season. I can’t believe you can’t see that.,Arsenal,Yes,jahl7yj,t1_jahh8jw
"Chilwell with license to bomb forward is something else. Couple of his touches were a bit off yesterday but he was absolutely rapid when played into space and I liked that he was seemingly allowed to put the ball in the box frequently.

Regardless of what you think it’s without a doubt the worst some of our best players have looked. Mount may not be one of our best now but was one of the best in the CL run and no matter what you think about him he has talent in him. However, he has looked woeful under Potter. Reece James and Chilwell were firing under Tuchel if they don’t get injured I still think we could have a had a chance to win the title or finish top 4 a lot more comfortably.

The club clearly has a ton of issues, and those might be excuses for poor results, but the strongest argument for sacking Potter has been the lack of heart/a plan on the pitch - that for me is inexcusable. 

What I saw yesterday was finally a whole team playing with desire, energy and commitment.

My point is we all thought Potter is an attacking coach but his XG made fool all of us he is very defensive mind of a coach who can't even set his team properly.

We have lots of grate individual players and part of main reason we are not conceding too many goals.

We haven't see any direction where are we going.

You can see Mourinho and Simeone are a defensive mind coach but we all know when there teams won the ball they attack so fast and so precise and they don't just bend over teams like Leeds and Southampton.

And this coward changes all his attacking options at 60 minutes mark. I mean defensive changes are ok but when others team press high to get a goal then your team must have a fast winger to counter attack No?

"Regardless what side of the Potter fence you’re on, the boys needed this today and it was good to see them happy after the match.  3pts and a clean sheet.  It’s a result, as Todd said.  

We’re getting into dangerous positions and creating chances.  I can’t think of another stretch of games, where we’ve been so unlucky in front of goal.  I might be off by a game, but I feel like Felix has hit the woodwork every game he’s been back from suspension.  He’s going to start making those.  Guaranteed.  Sterling has to make that pass, also.  That was a gimme.  Kante is soon to be back and if he’s good to go, I can’t wait to see him and Enzo operate.  Some were saying Chilly lost a step since he recovered, but fuck that, my boy was rapid today.  Once James is back again (any word on his hammy?), anyways.  It’s coming fellas.  Whether Potter has anything to do with it, or not.  This group will start getting things going soon.  

p.s.  If Mase can find his feet again, that would be immensely helpful.  I miss him having a positive impact on games and it would surely put to rest any talk of him leaving

And the other 40% are unhappy with the unconvincing way we played,Chelsea,Yes,jazkpzk,t1_jazire4
"Yeah, it's great to win, but at what cost does it come. 



Liverpool have had a horrible season and yet their manager has clawed them back up the table and they're now capable of going into the top 4 if they win their 2 games in hand. If our owners want to believe they have their own Klopp then they need to expect the same of him. 



We were neck and neck for ages and now they're without touching distance of top 4 and we're celebrating a win that keeps us ahead of 11th place on goal difference.",Chelsea,Yes,jazjylr,t1_jazigkh
Love seeing Alonso in a good team for once,Chelsea,Yes,jb1292q,t1_jb102c2
"Only manager who has not valued Mount. We might have to question his assessment skills. Or maybe it's down to player profile, but it's stupid not to extend a versatile player like Mount.",Chelsea,Yes,jaztski,t1_jazsyex
He's also been dropped by Southgate recently though and he always played him before.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0x57a,t1_jazsyex
"So how do you propose we utilise mount?

How should he be featuring in our current chelsea squad?",Chelsea,Yes,jazts1r,t1_jazsyex
"As seen by your previous comments, you are a mason mount fanboy over a chelsea fan. Mount let down Tuchel too. We play better when he’s not starting. But yes he definitely deserves 250k a year",Chelsea,Yes,jb2812o,t1_jazsyex

I don't think Nunez is a world beater and I don't think he'll become one. Other than him it's crazy the success they have up front.,Chelsea,Yes,jb1937s,t1_jb18jq6
"Seriously, I’m jealous of their ability to mail their big signings for the most part",Chelsea,Yes,jb24llr,t1_jb18jq6
"Not just his short stint here so far his end product wasn't there in Madrid either. There is reason despite being one of the highest paid players in the world he's on loan here. He's a flashy player but needs a system and team that is built around him to get end product. With Potter's system and the players that play around him, he's just not going to work. Screams another Havertz to me.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0rjqw,t1_jb0prcq
"Look at raw attributes. Felix is better on the ball and a lot quicker. Defences have to specifically pick him up.

If we work out a defined style of play and add some structure to his approach he’s a lot more threatening than Mount.",Chelsea,Yes,jb11cjs,t1_jb0prcq
It’s wholly unfair to compare felix currently to the best of mount considering felix has just joined and we have a horrible manage at the Helm with barely a system implemented So far and many new players to integrate,Chelsea,Yes,jb0qbdo,t1_jb0prcq
"Buying Felix for £100 million and getting rid of Mount is terrible business. And I’m not even a big Mount fan. I think he is overrated by some here since he’s English and a Cobham boy. But he is also getting slated way too hard currently, and he can be very good.",Chelsea,Yes,jb10l8y,t1_jb0prcq
United never win at Anfield. It’s basically like us against Spurs without Potter.,Chelsea,Yes,jb1bcj7,t1_jb1aqke
"3 losses in their last 33 games. I'm gonna have to disagree, Scored 52 goals in the same time we've scored... 7. One flukey result doesn't change their resurgence under 10Hag",Chelsea,Yes,jb1mtae,t1_jb1ku0r

"Havertz hasn't been playing well for a long time. Unfortunately, we don't have an option.",Chelsea,Yes,jazuzdv,t1_jazsoou
I still personally want potter gone. He's not a manager that will be able to go head to head with managers like klopp and pep like tuchel did imo. We will be playing way better under a better manager,Chelsea,Yes,jazs5ac,t1_jazndu6
Speaking of mental gymnastics. You just did an entire routine here. We were doing anything different under Tuchel this season. The same problems that Potter is having Tuchel was as well. Poor health among irreplaceable players. No competent striker since Diego Costa left.,Chelsea,Yes,jazpgjh,t1_jazndu6
We should’ve won it tbh.,Chelsea,Yes,jb269np,t1_jb1m87i
We need a new coach more a striker or a cdm my guy.,Chelsea,Yes,jb2shnm,t1_jb276eb
"I'm convinced we're ultimately just going to be wasting time under Potter if form improves. But as a fan I can't be unhappy with us winning and picking up form, anything otherwise and you'd want to re-assess your position as a fan of the club. I just reserve serious doubts over our ability to win any trophies under Potter. If we're thereabouts around top 4 I can see this board just sticking with him stubbornly so he succeeds. A world class manager gets this squad winning immediately, look no further than Ten Hag to see how quick progress can be under a great manager.",Chelsea,Yes,jaztr5m,t1_jazda46
">It’ll be the most fantastic thing.

No one would see it that way. This isn't some underdog story -- we were acquired for 4 billion pounds and we've spent another 600m pounds in the last two windows. It should be seen as an inevitability that we succeed, not a huge accomplishment. 

The only reason it feels that way is because we've got this garbage manager and a board that has managed to gaslight this entire fanbase into lowering their standards so much that a 1 nil win against 17th place Leeds from a goal that came off a random set piece header is considered a huge win.",Chelsea,Yes,jaze7gp,t1_jazda46
I am not convinced by Potter but I want him to do well. People wanting the team to lose just so that they can karma farm here or get validation on Twitter are screwed in the head.,Chelsea,Yes,jazkyeb,t1_jazda46
Finally someone with a level headed take,Chelsea,Yes,jazegs7,t1_jazda46
"Despite playing good initially, I'm starting to go off the idea of buying him completely. He's not worth blowing another 100m for and that's a fact. We seem to be obsessed with going after SS and players with no defined positions. Fucking hate it, buy players who know exactly what to do in that area and are accomplished at it. Buy a fucking striker!",Chelsea,Yes,jazsfqz,t1_jazr4pc
"Yeah fuck buying talented players when we can struggle with mount and Gallagher instead

Propah blues",Chelsea,Yes,jazthza,t1_jazr4pc
True youth english obssessed fanboy lol,Chelsea,Yes,jazwfia,t1_jazr4pc
I'd personally sell mount and Gallagher but instead of getting felix I would go back for that Russian kid zakharyan as back up to nkunku next season. If we can't sign the russian kid because of the whole conflict with russia and ukraine then use carney as a  backup cam. Honest question. Do You think mount wants to be a bench player? Do you think mount starts over nkunku?. When nkunku comes in there's no way in hell mount starts over him,Chelsea,Yes,jazrwqv,t1_jazr4pc
"I watch Chelsea, games between big 6 clubs, and UCL",Chelsea,Yes,jb3i62y,t1_jb2n5t9
"Only chelsea, sometimes others if out with friends or if I have nothing to do",Chelsea,Yes,jb2qzng,t1_jb2n5t9
I only watch chelsea games and the finals of the champions league and maybe 6/7 interesting other teams' matches per season.,Chelsea,Yes,jb2o6c9,t1_jb2n5t9
"Only chelsea typically. I don’t watch other games from the premier league as I find them pretty dull.

I have watched some Napoli games this season because Kvara and Osimhen are a super exciting duo",Chelsea,Yes,jb2x9cg,t1_jb2n5t9
"Nowadays, I’ll only watch if they’re close to our match and I’m bored. 

Still love footy in general, just that there’s less time to really sit down and catch every game while balancing your own life. Timezones are also a bitch for some of us.",Chelsea,Yes,jb3qt6r,t1_jb2n5t9
"I only watch Chelsea, with the exception of internationals where I watch England and then I also watch countries that have prominent Chelsea players in them, for example I have watched a lot of Spain over the years for Azpilicueta, Mata, Torres etc. 

Football games are 90 minutes minimum, I don't have time or the invested interest to watch other teams face each other.  I'll watch a 3 minute Sky Sports highlight if something really notable happens though.  

Plus, watching teams I don't like, do well, isn't really worth my time. 

Take today for example, Liverpool 7 - Man United 0 is funny, but still, cba to watch 90minutes of Liverpool having a great time, I significantly hate the scousers, so I would rather watch a 3 minute supercut of Man United have a terrible time haha.

Or watching Arsenal do a comeback and win 3-2. I don't need that negativity in my life. I only have one life & I would rather it be full of as many good moments in it as possible. Rather just read the result of those games.  

Now, let's say it was that time where Chelsea thrashed Arsenal 6-0 on Wenger's 1000th game in charge, I did watch that in full & loved every second. :)",Chelsea,Yes,jb2p8kr,t1_jb2n5t9
Can’t believe I stayed up to watch less than 3 mins of this fight smh,Chelsea,Yes,jazi1be,t1_jazfehf
That was embarrassing. Thankfully my friend paid for the PPV but that wasn't worth whatever the fuck it was.,Chelsea,Yes,jaziqn2,t1_jazfehf
One of the most disappointing fights I have ever seen. Could have told me he was paid off and I would have believed you lol.,Chelsea,Yes,jazpnut,t1_jazfehf
"Why are you acting like they aren’t offering him a contract?

It’s mount the one rejecting us",Chelsea,Yes,jazxaxx,t1_jazutsd
Why would we want the worst manager in the clubs history to ruin another season?,Chelsea,Yes,jb0lt7r,t1_jb0bj95
"> literally how most games went last season 

So we will finish third this season? 
Get your memory checked",Chelsea,Yes,jb00d30,t1_jb006ax
"Last season we finished 3rd and averaged 2 goals a game.

This season we’ve averaged less than 1 and are in 10th place.

We were never this bad under Tuchel last season, and that’s baring in mind that we’ve brought in Sterling, Mudryk, Aubameyang, Fofana, Madueke and Felix up front

Hell you could add Enzo to that who is the most creative midfielder we’ve had for years",Chelsea,Yes,jb036x4,t1_jb006ax
"I'd love to see a manager to do any better with CHO, Werner, Havertz, Pulisic, Ziyech, a mentally checked out overweight Lukaku as attacking and Alonso-Azpi as their full back options",Chelsea,Yes,jb06nkh,t1_jb006ax
Tuchel would have tried to go for more yesterday not those substitutions,Chelsea,Yes,jb017lj,t1_jb006ax
"Potter was never an overly offensive coach and that was evident at Brighton. He's more in the mold of someone who likes his team to have a lot of control in possession and generate chances that way - like Sarri, albeit more flexible than him. 

It's part of why Brighton fans are happier with RDZ as he encourages a more direct style of play.",Chelsea,Yes,jazhagu,t1_jazgiyq
"Potter has never been a defensive coach, nor does the goal tally of brighton prove this.

What potter is a coach who likes to make on the go changes (midgame)

Likes dynamic midfielders

Has a very friendly approach to his players, and are known to build a good atmosphere around players.

He also has a very good record of integrating future stars.

Judging de zerbi by his 20 games, is like judging potter by his 20 games at chelsea.",Chelsea,Yes,jazi135,t1_jazgiyq
"Yesterday Arsenal proves it's all a mentality thing. Their team is decent, but on paper ours is better, but their comebacks show grit and desire. They play like a team, a team that needs to win. We are weak as hell.",Chelsea,Yes,jazjr1o,t1_jazjq0v
">He’s going to start making those. Guaranteed.

I agree, but then I was always saying that about Timo.  IIRC he once had a crossbar hat trick!",Chelsea,Yes,jb00kzp,t1_jazim4d
"Agreed, I see your reason",Chelsea,Yes,jaztu2v,t1_jazrug1
I respectfully disagree. You can find alot of players who do what mount does or even better. You can't find many rb's like reece james,Chelsea,Yes,jaztd3v,t1_jazrug1
"Why?

Going forward I doubt mount starts. And James is among the very very best in his position, if not the best.",Chelsea,Yes,jaztfzq,t1_jazrug1
Reece fitness is a problem but are we fast to forget real madrid hsd genuine interest in him?,Chelsea,Yes,jazwcxd,t1_jazrug1
"One is a elite, world class in a hard to find position (but injury prone)

One is a great player but with no real elite traits, in an easy position to fill",Chelsea,Yes,jb0eier,t1_jazrug1
I can see the logic behind that take tbh.,Chelsea,Yes,jazsa10,t1_jazrug1
Definitely an unpopular opinion and one I don’t agree with. There’s a reason the likes of Real Madrid we’re sniffing around for Reece. He has the potential to be the best RB in the world. It was necessary to lock him up early.,Chelsea,Yes,jb261mz,t1_jazrug1
"I'd just love to see him get a run of games behind an actual striker.  He has shown the flashes of how good he truly can be, and I don't believe we've ever given him any significant run in his best position...which he unfortunately now shares with Félix and Nkunku.",Chelsea,Yes,jazybja,t1_jazxz4r
"Havertz on the right in a 3-4-2-1 could work really well however, he'd act like a false 9 which is his role",Chelsea,Yes,jb053g9,t1_jazxz4r
"Stop your bitching . Jesus Christ, how embarrassing.",Chelsea,Yes,jazi90a,t1_jazi0vr
"Havertz is a bit unlucky I think because of how the game has evolved, particularly in our league. Tall lanky lads are thought of as out-and-out strikers, and shorter lads who can make chances in the forward area by moving in between the lines are thought of as 10s. Havertz is neither of those.

He’s more like a playmaker that helps generate chances not by making Fabregas-style passes but by manipulating spaces to his benefit and creating avenues for other players to exploit.",Chelsea,Yes,jazfjmp,t1_jazebra
"He did, he press and work his ass  (same cant be said for either joao or sterling)

But he clearly aint a finisher, and his confidence is 0.

Lukaku would be more useful here... and that is sad",Chelsea,Yes,jazfd0l,t1_jazebra
"Yes it does.

different performances on different days doesn't change that.

Liverpool were there to be absolutely smashed for 5 or 6 when we played them. They were horrific.

If we played them today we'd be in the same position as United now",Chelsea,Yes,jb1ckf3,t1_jb1c9wa

"1. Keep kepa, Mendy has a purple patch and fell off hard, he also is very bad with his feet and and that single handedly knocked us out of CL vs Madrid last year

2.  Absolutely don’t sell Chillwell, he’s a warrior and a key player when fit. He also won the CL with us. Having winners of big trophies on the team helps build a winning culture for new players

3.  Don’t renew Zak unless fee is 35m or less and he performs at high level for remainder of season

4 sell chalobah, keep colwill

5 Kovacic gets a new contract

6 santos too early to tell. Needs to be assessed in preseason

7 keep mount sell Conor, easy choice

8 yes sell Kai, don’t buy striker next season unless quality player for decent fee is available. Make do with Lukaku broja and ddf 

9 if forced to loan a player, it’s ddf, not broja. Broja is ready to play if he recovers",Chelsea,Yes,jb245zi,t1_jb19nxx
"Number one would be Kepa for me. Mendy never got his head right after AFCON and his contract is winding down on a stalemate from what I remember. 

I’d keep all 3 left backs. Chilwell is great but past two seasons has had a lot of injuries, Maatsen should get minutes and Cucurella can play in a back3 if it’s needed.

Send Zakaria back, need a clean slate to think through the midfield

Sell Chalobah. Need to balance the books and colwill has a much higher ceiling and I’d rather give him time in the squad.

For Kova, depends on who we bring in. I’d be ok with selling him though, injures pretty often but he did have a great game captaining the team yesterday. Really took the game in the first half.

Santos has been great in international but I think he would do well with a loan in the prem. I’d be surprised if he makes the jump to our midfield unless we get Europa conference or Europa league so he can get the game time.

Keep mount 100%. Playing him so much the past 3 years, he was bound to have a down year. I’d be he’ll find his form again soon.

Sell Havertz for Ivan Toney or Vlahovic if we can pry him out of Juve. I doubt we’d keep Félix without Europe 

Loan D. Fofana, I think people forget he came straight from the Scandinavian league. And Broja is injured until august, we’d need to manage his minutes. Doubt clubs would want an injured striker on loan",Chelsea,Yes,jb1gmez,t1_jb19nxx
"I'd sell both Mendy and Kepa.

Neither will ever start for a title challenging team",Chelsea,Yes,jb19w4t,t1_jb19nxx
He has a good thing going on with Roma. I wouldn't mind Simeone or Carlo.,Chelsea,Yes,jb28uya,t1_jb1iw1r
He still has the ultra defensive mindset. Dont follow serie a that much but his team has conceded 10 less as well as scored 10 less than anyone in the top 6.,Chelsea,Yes,jb274xo,t1_jb1iw1r
"I wanted us to win, but for those fans it wasn’t about vindication.

It’s incredibly clear that Potter is not the man for the job, and a lot on here feel the sooner he goes the better.

If one loss meant he was gone, that was worth it for a lot of people. 

Look at what happened with United. Ole obviously wasn’t the man to take them forward long term, and this was obvious for a long time. Every time the sacking rumours were at the highest United would get a big win before reverting to form. 

The improvement under Ten Haag has shown what a competent manager can do",Chelsea,Yes,jb00ead,t1_jazyx9v
"Loser mentality u have, winning against shit relegated almost side like Leeds means nothing

Wait for Dortmund",Chelsea,Yes,jb0v79t,t1_jazyx9v
"Oh fuck off. I wanted us to win but there's no denying it wasn't a performance that shows Potter's on the right track. Apart from sending diagonals to Chilly, we still looked pretty clueless in respect of an overall idea and structure against a team struggling to survive.",Chelsea,Yes,jazzcpr,t1_jazyx9v
"It's the exact opposite if you think about it. Plastic fans want instant gratification-win now, real fans want what is best for the club-sack Potter.",Chelsea,Yes,jazzail,t1_jazyx9v
"We took 3 losses in a row before yesterday's game. If it was certain that potter would be sacked after a loss yesterday, i would've endured another loss for him to fuck off. But we all know the owners will stick with him even if he relegates this team, so i'm just watching these league friendlies carefree",Chelsea,Yes,jb00rdl,t1_jazyx9v
"What a childish comment 

I wanted us to win but I can understand why people perhaps wanted potter to lose so we get in a new manager and can stop being a laughing stock 

Stop thinking so short term.",Chelsea,Yes,jazz596,t1_jazyx9v
What a shit take. It’s fine for a person to think that a loss tomorrow would be better in the long run if it meant Potter gets sacked just like it’s fine for a person to want to back potter. This shit “plastic” hunt the subs been on has been so fucking backwards.,Chelsea,Yes,jb066sk,t1_jazyx9v
"What an idiotic comment. Where did you get the notion that we'd be ""vindicated"" after a Chelsea loss from?",Chelsea,Yes,jb035uq,t1_jazyx9v
Our issue is that we quite literally ‘don’t score’ but I wouldn’t mind scoring less than others while holding onto 1-0 or 2-0 like under Tuchel,Chelsea,Yes,jb1wmz4,t1_jb1ibx2
We’re 10th and United is 3rd,Chelsea,Yes,jb1uztr,t1_jb1ibx2
"Let's not pretend Pulisic has been better for us than Havertz.

Havertz has scored the winning goal in multiple finals.

I don't think he's great and wouldn't mind him moving on but he's been far better than Pulisic who's been a crappy bench warmer at both his clubs in 2 different leagues.

If both move in the summer I know which one will attract the bigger clubs and the bigger fees.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0wdd2,t1_jb0sp33

"She has had lower-league offers in the past, but none of those compare to being the manager of Chelsea Women. I think winning the Champions League with the ladies is the pinnacle for her.

There is no way a top division club would take the risk of being the first club to appoint a female manager. The level and dynamics involved are completely different - but it would be an interesting experiment for sure.",Chelsea,Yes,jb3495t,t1_jb2yvqw
"While I admire the wanting to be inclusive, the mens game is far more competitive. Different dynamics and much, much higher pressure.

Watching her go through what Potter is going through now would also be fairly sickening.",Chelsea,Yes,jb4egwu,t1_jb2yvqw
"It's not about whether or not he's worth 200k a week, no one is. It's about whether or not he fits into the 200k per week category of OUR wage budget set out by OUR owners. 


Is Sterling worth 375k a week? Koulibaly 325k? Reece James 250k? Is Azpi worth 180k? Cucurella 175k? Auba 160k? 



I don't know where you're getting the 200k figure for from Mount, but if our owners, within the past year have decided that Koulibaly and Sterling can be on those wages and Cucurella can be on just under it, then does Mount fit into that wage structure at around 200k? Almost definitely. Is he worth that? No, but no one is.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0s6o9,t1_jb0j4in

Saka is a much better player and on 200k a week. Mount will be unlikely to start regularly next season; 200k for a bench player is crazy

"Lol, the fact we had to park bus against Leeds to force a 1-0 win from a set piece goal has convinced most that Potter aint it at all",Chelsea,Yes,jb1blzp,t1_jb19cqh
"Sorry I don’t see that happening at all. I’m not saying Potter would fail. But from what I saw so far, Potter severely lacks of in game tactics flexibility to turn the game and lacks of the inspiration needed to be among the best manager. I don't how how he will improve from here nor how his era at Chelsea will turn out. But he is surely not among the top3-5 manager for sure.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1a3vx,t1_jb19cqh
"He’d fit in perfectly. Liverpool play a 3 in midfield, and mainly their job is to hustle for the ball and press. Perfect for Mount.",Chelsea,Yes,jb01rii,t1_jazvjoe
"Not really. He'd fit them perfectly. He'd be more like wijnaldum for them.good at pressing and moving people around. Can get goals and assists in midfield.

But he's got a lot of energy and that's something Liverpool have missed since he left and Henderson started getting older and missing games.

He's probably trying to implement that philosophy of Liverpool 2017-2020 again. Would be a big mistake to sell him to Liverpool.",Chelsea,Yes,jazzxxz,t1_jazvjoe

"They’re completely different players. Felix has shown how talented he is, especially when given the freedom as a 10. 

Mount is an 8, and will do very well if he goes to Liverpool, who under Klopp, actually play with 8s. 

I’m torn. Felix looks insane in blue. I don’t want to see Mount in red either, but if he’s going to walk for free after next season, it makes so much more sense to sell him.

Gakpo came in and has been molded into a very different role than he ever did (Firmino's role).

Christensen wasn’t the club’s fault so much. He agreed terms then backed out,Chelsea,Yes,jb0po0x,t1_jb0o7b5
"Giving him a £240k a week deal based on the performances he’s been putting up isn’t justified either. 

I don’t want us to lose him either but giving him a bumper contract would send a message that mediocrity is rewarded here and may be more detrimental for Chelsea in the longer term imo",Chelsea,Yes,jb0pbwt,t1_jb0o7b5
"Because it doesn't tell the full picture. It's an extremely reductive tool when measuring a single attacking performance. A team can finish a game with 0.0xG, but during that game they could've gotten in behind 100 times and misplaced every simple pass for a tap-in.

Anyone with half a brain could see that Liverpool deserved more than 2/3 goals. In reality, Liverpool got into so many dangerous positions in the second half that it was a joke.",Chelsea,Yes,jb2p5u1,t1_jb2oncq
"Yup, Chillwell at RWB with license to roam forward hits different

Him and James can be incredible in a back 4 as well, just look to Liverpool and their success with their fullbacks as the example. Potter needs to get the best out of them to really unlock the team.

Oh good point that must be it. But wouldnt it have been good to have him primed for dortmund?,Chelsea,Yes,jb42cft,t1_jazyd1j
Honestly I doubt we’ll go for a back 3. We need a goal so Dortmund could easily just use a low block and we’d be fucked.,Chelsea,Yes,jazwzr7,t1_jazu1cq

that's because people here think 3atb with wingbacks means we play 5atb terrorist ball.,Chelsea,Yes,jb1hr6t,t1_jb12jlz

"If you referring to the two losses to Liverpool last season, those are just two of 10 unsuccessful domestic cup runs over the past 5 seasons.

Even this season, we lost both wingbacks to injuries against Milan that hurt us massively pre WC.",Chelsea,Yes,jb34lme,t1_jb33ww1
The way Felix has been talking it's like he's already signed permanently.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0v6sj,t1_jb0e39m
Felix is more talented than Mount on a technical basis but Mount (besides his poor run now) is a more complete and functional player. If you lose a functional player like him then you should replace him with another functional player (Nkunku),Chelsea,Yes,jb06oxy,t1_jb05zrr
"There’s no guarantee that Nkunku hire the ground running like Felix has. As long as the asking price isn’t insane, buying Felix makes sense.",Chelsea,Yes,jb08p0w,t1_jb05zrr

The current squad issues existed under Tuchel. Did you not watch us play football for the last 12 months. It’s the same issue for both. Not defending Potter but the issues that exist now started halfway through last season and have only been exacerbated further by Potter.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0scyl,t1_jazpulr
Don’t bother with the downvotes mate. Bunch of fragile little man children upset that they didn’t get their wish last night of coming here to Karma farm with Potter hate. People don’t understand that you can support the team while not being convinced by Potter.,Chelsea,Yes,jazmg4d,t1_jazlfxs
"Yeah I know he is that roamer, but does he actually create much at the end of it all, I'm not seeing it. Again though he's technically wonderful on the ball, but for Chelsea right now he's a luxury player who won't provide the end product for a team that desperately needs it. Ironically, who we desperately need is another Bruno Fernandes who may frustrate but he's all about the end product. I think maybe that's who it could be but isn't he better out wide? Admittedly I haven't seen too much of Nkunku live but what I have seen he was good drifting out left. 

I'm just extremely wary of blowing our money on Felix, we simply cannot get these next moves wrong in this squad or good luck to us for the next year's when we cannot sustain this heavy spending every season..All I want is someone like Vlahovic or Osimhen up front who can finish.",Chelsea,Yes,jaztgtp,t1_jazt1te

"He also sacked his agent and made his dad his new agent

You don’t usually sack your agent unless you’re unhappy with them; often in football it’s because you want a move away. Never heard of a player switching agents when negotiating a contract

"I mean I mean last season, mount had 11 goals, havertz n lukaku had 8, pulisic n reece 6, ziyech, timo n cho had a bunch of goals, that accounts for >60% of the goals. Even Arsenal this season has goals across its squad.
We played well yesterday, controlled the game for most parts, but thats just one game. Comparing it to how we played last season is outrageous. Last season, outside of the City games, we were able to control most of the games. If we can do that consistently from now on this season, we can talk.",Chelsea,Yes,jb06ikw,t1_jb023dg
“Yesterday was literally how most games went last season”,Chelsea,Yes,jb1ome7,t1_jb0eqk7
"We were always in control and almost always looked unbeatable in the beginning of the last season, nothing like yesterday and calling it grinding out results is quite a stretch, we were top of the league and in an upward trajectory before the injuries/covid. And had the same attackers still, quite an expensive group of players but their performances here under different managers and Tuchel's career and play style overall should point out what was the reason for the underwhelming attacking output, CHO and Werner moved and are not even regular starters for Leverkusen and Leipzig, Lukaku is benched by a 40 year old Dzeko today. Tuchel's nothing like Jose, come on",Chelsea,Yes,jb19s4y,t1_jb0djjn
"It's madness, 3 years, 3 managers, multiple positions, teammates, formations and he's still shit. But wait if we just try this he'll be good I swear.


He's like our Pogba who United fans spent years talking about how to unlock, except worse than Pogba on the pitch and less controversial off it.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0kt6h,t1_jb06f9b
And yet he's always playing even under Tuchel and Flick... They must all see something we don't,Chelsea,Yes,jb07z2a,t1_jb06f9b
"Oh yes there was an error I made in the second paragraph. 

Why do you think I am trying to sound *intellectual*?",Chelsea,Yes,jb0fynp,t1_jb0f66s
You're the kinda guy that would celebrate getting invited to a party.,Chelsea,Yes,jb1ddtu,t1_jb1d5c1
Lmao he threw in Pulisic 🤣,Chelsea,Yes,jb1iwvi,t1_jb1fz2c
"Nice! One thing I’m really curious about is what we do with Lukaku.. that’s a big gamble with the board+potter(or whoever) when we start next season if we try to re-integrate him. 

If it were me, I’d keep him out. First team needs consistency in the direction of squad building, and Lukaku isn’t that",Chelsea,Yes,jb2pa6v,t1_jb24d5w
If we’d sustained that pressure we would of played well just like if we’d tactically outclassed every over team we faced we’d be winning the league. Bit redundant of u to essentially say “if some of Potters biggest shortcomings weren’t there then he’d be a good manager”,Chelsea,Yes,jb06dkz,t1_jb02nz1
yeah fuck me for supporting the team even when we're down. I should be sending death threats to Potter like the REAL supporters are doing.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0wfgc,t1_jb0pocd
"Pulisic at his best was 6 games at the end of the season in the strangest conditions in football has ever seen.

Pulisic has been absolutely dog shit 99% of his entire career at 2 different clubs under half a dozen different managers.

He's just simply not very talented which is why he inevitably gets benched wherever he plays or whoever coaches him 

Per minute stats are irrelevant as Puli being a career long bench warmer often comes on against tired legs when the games are stretched.

Kai is a 23 year old with 75 career goals.
Pulisic having played 12 games less is a 24 year old with 45 career goals

Again I don't rate Kai particularly highly but as a player he's obviously levels above Pulisic and every manager that coaches them both can see that.",Chelsea,Yes,jb10g48,t1_jb0z1m7
Late 2021 when Lukaku got injured he was in good form.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0zdbs,t1_jb0z1m7
"They have given out 8 of our top 10 highest paid contracts...


The other 2 players in the top 10 are Kante and Chilwell",Chelsea,Yes,jb0y0ng,t1_jb0ud9x
Sakas a tremendous player; I did also always say saka was better too,Chelsea,Yes,jb0m9dw,t1_jb0m75y
"Yeah I gathered I'd missed it. Wanted to know where I could find streams for future games, watched him at the u20 Brasil comp and he was great. Want to keep watching him. I'll look ok twitter next time cheers",Chelsea,Yes,jb2lge5,t1_jb2l4fb
"Agreed but the club should have sold or renewed either AC or Rudi. 

Losing both on a free is an unacceptable outcome.",Chelsea,Yes,jb258fs,t1_jb0po0x
It's hardly rewarding mediocrity when he's been so crucial for us in the previous 2 seasons. Spending £100m on Felix + his wages isn't exactly saving any money is it?,Chelsea,Yes,jb0q1ly,t1_jb0pbwt
"Yea, it’s a useful stat but it’s annoying when people try act like it’s to only thing that matters",Chelsea,Yes,jb3trul,t1_jb2p5u1
"He was clear through on goal, took too long barely looked up and decided chipping it was better when he could have took it past the goalie, or hit it low and hard BOTH choices make it much more difficult than trying to chip a goalie when the ball is at exactly the height that favours a keeper. It was no more a 'very difficult save'. I'd love it for him to prove me wrong but he has zero conviction in front of goal, Aubameyang would have scored that.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0i0u5,t1_jb0c00q
Go back further and you'll see I always say he plays better in Europe ! Glad he was immense last night!,Chelsea,Yes,jbdp920,t1_jbcms7f

"What did you make of
RLCs performance yesterday then?",Chelsea,Yes,jb0jwzu,t1_jb0jtv3
I honestly don’t think so. Dortmund had more possession and marginally less number of attacking attempts. Think we had 18 or 19 and they had 15ish. The team played really well for like 20 minutes and it got pretty even,Chelsea,Yes,jb0k5tu,t1_jb0jorl
Doesn’t fit the narrative,Chelsea,Yes,jb0k94k,t1_jb0jorl
Like yeah we've done terrorist ball at times but majority of the time we don't do it,Chelsea,Yes,jb24xv4,t1_jb1hr6t

"Some of you need to go outside and understand that football isn’t all about your team, is it a crime to enjoy a good game of football when your team is struggling.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1hez4,t1_jb1fbjb
\+3 GD before regulation gets them to extra time. Then possibly penalties. But I guess the comment on away goals was off because it would potentially have helped them. Just meant that 4-1 or 3-0 is a possible path.,Chelsea,Yes,jb1wfg9,t1_jb1uv5q
Score but very rare to go 6-0 up against Southampton then batter Madrid because we didn’t have recognized scorers still,Chelsea,Yes,jb4369x,t1_jb2t15w
"Felix is definitely a luxury player atm.

Doesn't provide goals or assists and at the same time is not as good defensively as mount.

Gonna be KDB situation all over again.",Chelsea,Yes,jb06t6h,t1_jb06oxy
"The fact is, there’s no chance we’d get Felix for below 100mil- it was the asking price in December and that was before he was on a ridiculous contract. There’s no guarantee about Nkunku but there are never guarantees about players so having the alternative of spending 100 mil for a position that doesn’t need reinforcing whilst we have little money and other positions that we’re light in doesn’t make sense.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0cxd6,t1_jb08p0w
If that is “Insane” the standards are as low as they have ever been.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0gf7r,t1_jb0cflb
"Not insane, but our most creative player by a distance.  Also, had he not hit the bar twice recently (I know.. I know.. ), he would also have been our most productive by far.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0ls47,t1_jb0cflb
"We now have 3 wins in 17 (?) PL games. All the suffering was worth it.

Suck on that, plastics!",Chelsea,Yes,jb2xz1s,t1_jb2svde
"DDF

He can't do worse than Havertz, he actually had positive cameos in the limited minutes he received, and currently Potter does not even put him on the bench over useless Aubameyang.",Chelsea,Yes,jazziwc,t1_jazzert
"Give Auba another chance, his work rate might be shit (always has been, everywhere he’s been) but give him a chance to finish and he’ll take it, especially now that we’ve started creating chances again.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0a5md,t1_jazzert
"Havertz mount Gallagher will all fetch 100m minimum combined

Felix can be easily funded and is better than all 3 of them easily",Chelsea,Yes,jaztkdo,t1_jaztgtp
"Nkunku being injury Prone is a myth. Before the wc injury , he has missed less than 15 games in his Leipzig career",Chelsea,Yes,jb188wu,t1_jb0ojpb
Carney needs a loan. Possibly two.,Chelsea,Yes,jazzvyx,t1_jazsuzr
Do you think Felix would?,Chelsea,Yes,jb0hec6,t1_jb0gizn
"Precisely.

We lose control of games now but before we'd always have a grip of the game but cannot create enough chances",Chelsea,Yes,jb06z4z,t1_jb06ikw
"I don’t remember us always being in control. A lot of games were ass clenching towards the end of them. League position is irrelevant when it comes to performances, you can win the same amount of games playing nice football or shit football, it’s the same end result.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1bdvc,t1_jb19s4y
"He’s played under every manager lol, yet people here think better. I will say I’d prefer a CF to play in front of him and Felix, but I don’t want him off the team.",Chelsea,Yes,jb09fmp,t1_jb07z2a
Because he does other things really well like pressing which managers like and it's not like those 2 had a wealth of options. From a purely attacking pov he's just not the guy which is a shame. He just ain't a natural goalscorer and he's not much of a creator either.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0dn2c,t1_jb07z2a
Remind me how Germany have done in their last two tournaments?,Chelsea,Yes,jb0l2tm,t1_jb07z2a
Someone’s had a bad day hahahaha. Lighten up you miserable cunt.,Chelsea,Yes,jb1dn4h,t1_jb1ddtu
"The Lukaku situation is tricky. He won’t be sold because nobody will want his wages unless we subsidize them. May be worth to take it as a sink cost and just take the L on the transfer fee and subsidized wages for the rest of his contract. 

I’m also open to keeping him, but that will largely depend on preseason I think. If potter is going to primarily use a possession based system, I don’t think it makes since because Lukaku thrives in space and counterattacks. That was the failure of Tuchel with Lukaku. His system flashed with lukakus strengths.",Chelsea,Yes,jb2qmfr,t1_jb2pa6v
"That’s just false and shows your insane bias. Pulisic has THE best g+a/90 of all the attackers since he’s been here. He’s also at .75 g+a/90 in the UCL since being here. That is not a bad player, and to say that it is shows you aren’t logical. 

Pulisic was literally a starter for us before getting injured, and the fact that we have scored 4 goals in 11 matches since he’s been out (2 by defenders mind you) kinda points to the fact that he is actually one of our better attackers. 

The metrics literally prove you to be wrong.",Chelsea,Yes,jb118et,t1_jb10g48
"He was. You are correct. It was actually early 2022, but he did have a solid stretch.",Chelsea,Yes,jb11gq5,t1_jb0zdbs
Compare it to our January signings. Where we finally had a respectable backroom team,Chelsea,Yes,jb0y2h7,t1_jb0y0ng
What's mount done this season and this season only to deserve 200+k a week?. If we are rewarding players that big of contract for having a good season a year or two ago then let's give mendy 200+k a week no? After all mendy was one of the best goalkeepers in the world a season and two ago. Just using your logic mate🙃,Chelsea,Yes,jb0r67d,t1_jb0q1ly
"Another reason why xG is useless at times: Against Utd, Liverpool broke the PL record (since Opta began) for entries into an opposition box with 77  entries. Liverpool were a hot knife and Utd's defence was butter.

But apparently they only deserved 2/3 goals.",Chelsea,Yes,jb51jcp,t1_jb3trul
"He looked really good, probably his best performance since the spurs game in August. I think right now wingback suits him a bit better than in the midfield. He can use the touch line to his advantage and is less likely to get caught taking too many touches. Also keeps him out wide where he can cross the ball in or play one-twos to get others into the box.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0kczc,t1_jb0jwzu
"Dortmund having more possession was clearly part of Chelsea’s tactics. It was a clear departure from how Chelsea usually play to limit Dortmund’s ability to break which is how they get most of their goals. Chelsea controlled the game well in the Dortmund half, exemplified by them having less attacking chances while having more possession…",Chelsea,Yes,jb0l0wn,t1_jb0k5tu
"In the 2nd half we had them penned in pretty well 

Most of their
Xg came from that one adeyemi goal 

We racked up over 2xg and couldn’t convert 

I thought we adjusted well in the 2nd half",Chelsea,Yes,jb0ktny,t1_jb0k5tu
"I'd rather they beat Liverpool.  I despise the murders.

Either way I don't particularly care about the results of much better teams when our rivals are currently Crystal Palace and Aston Villa.

I'm not going to banter a club that is currently miles ahead of us by every possible metric.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1gz95,t1_jb1gq7l
"""Good game of football"" ""7-0 result"" 

Pick one.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1ho7f,t1_jb1hez4
"I notice how Felix loses a lot of time on the ball when he should be doing things a lot quicker, those milliseconds make a massive difference in terms of being able to create higher-quality chances. You don't see Odegaard take an extra touch for example",Chelsea,Yes,jb07lp3,t1_jb06t6h
DDF is having his first full season as a pro coming from the Norwegian league... He's not ready to be a starter in the EPL for Chelsea,Chelsea,Yes,jb05cxo,t1_jazziwc
I'm talking about CL,Chelsea,Yes,jb0062f,t1_jazziwc
He isn’t in the CL squad,Chelsea,Yes,jb0aue6,t1_jb0a5md
Bullshit. Felix ain't even better than Havertz. Put havertz in that no 10 position and he'll do better than Felix. Felix will be the most pointless signing ever and will take years to rectify our mistake,Chelsea,Yes,jb02lbc,t1_jaztkdo
"We should get more than that.

But the overhang is if Potter is sacked and the next manager prefer resources like Mount than flair players",Chelsea,Yes,jaztyb8,t1_jaztkdo
"Yeah Mount could go for 50-60, even with a year left, I don't want it but if it happens it is what it is, he had the power to extend if he truly wishes to.
Maybe Felix improves with better players around him, that could be very likely, but if it happens I hope its for way less than 100m. I still cling to hope that we can somehow include Luakku into the deal, I feel like he actually suits Atletico perfectly and he hasn't been to La Liga yet.",Chelsea,Yes,jazu1mc,t1_jaztkdo
He's been injured a lot this year and has never played in the league.   No way should we count on his success.,Chelsea,Yes,jb19zeu,t1_jb188wu
I'm not advocating for us to buy felix. I would love mount to stay but realistically this guy is not accepting being a bench player to nkunku,Chelsea,Yes,jb0iib0,t1_jb0hec6
"Yeah. Last season, we had too many individual errors. We always managed to blow up our lead somehow.  We were far more efficient in front of the goal. So, the one or two clear cut chances we got every game were usually enough. (cue the Wolves game 2-2). 

This season, somehow our midfield is wide open, our press from the front three is shit. Our attackers are so low in confidence, it's hard to watch them take shots. We played well yesterday, but on another day, against even slightly better opposition, it won't be enough. With whatever time Potter has earned from yesterday, he has to fix these issues.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0bvsp,t1_jb06z4z
Their defense is made of Swiss cheese. They score goals.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0w2nb,t1_jb0l2tm
"Todays been pretty good.

Just sad to see a loser like you on every post trying to pretend our poor results weren't so poor under Graham while often pretending things were much worse before he came in.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1dsz4,t1_jb1dn4h
"Lmao.

Americans and trying to pretend per 90 stats matter for bench warmers name a better duo

Your 2nd paragraph is actually hilarious when you consider Pulisic has 1 goal in 21 games this season and We've literally been bringing in multiple wingers this season so we don't have to even have Pulisic on the bench.",Chelsea,Yes,jb11o01,t1_jb118et
Mendy isn't coveted by the top clubs in England lmao these two scenarios are not the same 😂 Please use a bit of common sense before making ridiculous comparisons like that,Chelsea,Yes,jb0sduw,t1_jb0r67d
"I don't think that's much of a high bar.

We all love Ruben, but I didn't feel he was much threat really going forward yesterday. All our opportunities yesterday really came down the other flank.

"He’s played, 3 games in blue? I think he’s done pretty well, and will only get better with time.",Chelsea,Yes,jb08rfo,t1_jb07lp3
"We have him one chance as a starter and he did well there. Like I said, he literally can't do worse than Havertz, while there is a chance he might do better.

All it takes is just a bit of more balls from Potter to drop a player who is not performing.",Chelsea,Yes,jb06202,t1_jb05cxo
What do you see in Havertz that makes you defend him so much? Is you neck on the line?,Chelsea,Yes,jb0erdd,t1_jb05cxo
You haven't mentioned talking about CL anywhere.,Chelsea,Yes,jb00jvo,t1_jb0062f
"No manager should prefer mount to felix in the cam spot. It’s absolute nonsense if you do

"Yeah we can’t let mount go for free is the main thing

Felix won’t be 100m; I’ve seen reports of around 70 to 80m.",Chelsea,Yes,jazu3wm,t1_jazu1mc
"Sorry I was speaking to someone else as well today about Mount/ Felix, I thought u were them. Realistically, I would definitely say Mount would be fine. The biggest strength he has as a player is his versatility so even though he would be out of our strongest starting XI, he could still easily make it as an AM, an 8 or a LW/LM. Nkunku is a bit injury prone as is so having Mount as back up would be quality.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0jj7n,t1_jb0iib0
"Do you know the meaning of a joke? It’s football ffs, it’s not that deep.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1e28w,t1_jb1dsz4
"67% of his goal contributions have come as a starter. Bench warmer numbers? Yet again, the stats show you are wrong. It’s fun arguing with idiots who just think saying things without backing actually matter. You sound dumb. 

Pulisic has played 600 minutes in those 21 games, while Havertz has played 1800 minutes in his 24 games. It’s almost like that’s not an even slate huh? And guess what, in Havertz 3x playing time, he has… wait for it… 3x the number of goal contributions. Even with playing consistent minutes, and actually playing at the head of the attack for significant minutes, havertz has done crap with the time he has played. 

For once it would be nice to have legitimate debate, but you can’t really offer that. Have a great day knowing that Havertz has scored 1 goal in his last 11 starts. Great player",Chelsea,Yes,jb13oi2,t1_jb11o01
It's your logic tho. Mendy was crucial for us last season and the season before that. Why shouldn't he get 200k a week now just like you are saying mount should?,Chelsea,Yes,jb0t894,t1_jb0sduw
">	All our opportunities yesterday really came down the other flank. 

This was on purpose mate. They overloaded the right side to draw Ayling inside and created acres for Chilwell.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0n0h8,t1_jb0lkf8
"That's true, I guess we can see at the end of the season if he should be a good buy",Chelsea,Yes,jb09rvq,t1_jb08rfo
"The risk is that he might do worse and with the toxic atmosphere around the club now, this could really kill the player's confidence. He should be eased into the first 11 no matter the circumstances",Chelsea,Yes,jb06i3h,t1_jb06202
That's alright. But what if the manager doesn't play a role which has CAM? Something like what Tuchel did where pressing is more important and progressive carries are prioritised,Chelsea,Yes,jazu6cn,t1_jazu11y
"Felix is my favorite player on our team ATM, but I think he has another weakness.  He seems to fall off midway through the second half.  I think Potter was right to sub him off when he did.  Gallagher may not be as good a player, but he provides fresh legs and a similar spark.",Chelsea,Yes,jazvdd1,t1_jazu11y
"I can live with 70m, that's almost exactly what Havertz cost and he's already shown man of the match performances which is something Havertz has never done in his entire time here.",Chelsea,Yes,jazu8r8,t1_jazu3wm
"I can see the confusion on this morons face as he simultaneously tries to argue Pulisic is a starter for us and that he's only played 600 minutes in 21 games

While he also tries to claim Pulisic doesn't have bench warmer minutes yet has a third of Havertz contributions in a third of the minutes.

Honestly the state of some people on here is hilarious",Chelsea,Yes,jb16000,t1_jb13oi2
He isn't exactly a hot commodity. Mount would be snapped up by pretty much every team in Europe.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0uwcl,t1_jb0t894
"It's ""on purpose"" only to the extent that Cheek's attacking abilities are very limited.  Put in a real attacking player in that position and the game looks very different.  I was disagreeing with your assessment that he ""looks very good"". 

However, I think we can respectfully agree to disagree.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0nm3x,t1_jb0n0h8
"Yeah that big long diagonal from koulibaly and co into chilwell was on all day, was good to see",Chelsea,Yes,jb0nbyb,t1_jb0n0h8

"No, he can't do worse than Havertz because Kai is already playing at absolutely dire level.

You need to send clear signal to player that if they don't perform, manager won't hesitate to replace them with youth.

EDIT: You also have a strange definition of being eased to first 11 - being left out of the squad in favor of useless player who won't be there in 3 months",Chelsea,Yes,jb06ow5,t1_jb06i3h
"Then felix can be shifted out to the wing no problem

If we play a formation without a cam then mount also will suffer as he can’t shift out to the wing",Chelsea,Yes,jazu8ql,t1_jazu6cn
"By the way, in the time that Pulisic has been injured, Havertz has played more minutes than Pulisic has all season, and he has less goal contributions during that time, than Pulisic has this season. Havertz has played 870 minutes since Pulisic’s injury, and he has 1 goal. That’s it",Chelsea,Yes,jb17kfs,t1_jb16000
"He started the 3 games post World Cup and 1 of the final 2 games before the World Cup. He wasn’t a starter at the beginning of the season obviously, but he clearly had worked himself into that spot. Who’s the moron?

And he’s clearly had bench warmer minutes this year. I’m not dumb. He’s also been out injured the last 11 games, which I don’t know, may have something to do with his limited minutes. I’m talking about over his entire Chelsea career. But clearly you are incapable of critical thinking.",Chelsea,Yes,jb16l3i,t1_jb16000
"It was on purpose to the extent that exposing Ayling was an obvious tactic. And using Ruben as a ball carrier and his passing in tight spaces to draw Leeds to the right was important to creating the space. 

This is a good example by what I mean when I say, the things I read here are night and day from how me and my mates discuss games.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0p2b0,t1_jb0nm3x
Is he really that creative though? I feel like he doesn't create much,Chelsea,Yes,jb0aew8,t1_jb09v33

"I think Mudryk is adapting. He hasn’t hit the ground running per se but you can tell the ability is there and the willingness to adapt is there.

Just play with the thought, if we had Ten Hag, do you think he could achieve anything? How could anyone coach a team with the owners constantly up in their ass questioning everything? This whole situation is a disaster.

Like what happened to Brighton after we stole their coaching stuff? They got even better. So what's up with that? It just means Brighton's success was not the result of Graham Potter's masterclass, like for example River Plate's success can be attributed to Gallardo. It means Brighton is doing well because their owner and directors are all doing a very good job, and as a result the team is doing a very good job.

That picture of Boehly and Potter walking together at Cobham is actually making me sick. Do you know who deserved that kind of support? Tuchel. Not backing him and now refusing to sack Potter is madness. An owner behaving like that does have an impact on the team and clearly shows. Even on the manager.

The board completely fucked that by bringing a dozen mostly inexperienced new players and bloating the squad over 30 players and putting someone who doesn't seem to equipped to deal with it or able to say it's a bad idea in charge, in Potter's defense most managers couldn't deal with that but he should have prevented it from happening but that would probably cause him to share the same fate with Tuchel eventually

Half the starting line up change between some games, some players start a game but can't even find a place on the bench in the next one, probably except for Reece and Silva every player in the squad either just joined or their future beyond this summer is uncertain, and even more shockingly there are players who fall into both categories, and Potter clearly lost on how to handle that, that's not a team just a random group of footballers so we see that disjointed mess on the pitch.

"Clearly there is a mentality problem with our players, especially the attackers. Since Hazard, none of our attackers except maybe Willian have been reliable for an entire season. The problem has to be deeper than the manager just being shit. Attackers under Lamps (2nd season especially) were shit, under TT they were shit, and under Potter they are shit. Hell even under Sarri our attack was pass to Hazard and inshallah. 


Imo this lack of attacking quality started glaring sometime during Lampard's second season which caused him to fuck up the team defensively to compensate for the shit attacking, especially against teams that park the bus so they can counter.


Then Tuchel came and as good as we were under him, we were always more reliant on our defensive solidity then pushing from there. But our attack never got quite going no matter who we had either players wise or manager wise. When our defense got shit after Rudi left especially, TT was sacked. 


The attacking problem imo is deeper than it being the managers fault, because TT failed, Lamps failed and Potter is failing. Not to mention Sarri too, but he was bailed by Hazard.",Chelsea,Yes,jarfpw6,t1_jarbt9k

If I was him, I would have an honest discussion with the players, see what their expectations are, let them know the situation that we are in, etc. I would not play Kai up top anymore, he is not a striker, and it is obvious every single match he plays. This also means that I would include Aubamayang in the starting line up. I would not play Ziyech as a starter, as he is just not cutting it, so I would move either Mudryk or Sterling out to the right (Sterling and Mudryk starting is the way forward for me), and have Felix playing as CAM.   


Aubamayang  
Mudryk - Felix - Sterling  
Enzo - (Kova/Kante/RLC)  
  Chillwell - KK - Fofana - Azpi  
Kepa  


Probably a ton of room for improvement to these choices by the way, just pulling something out of thin air.

Edit: to clarify, this is just the lineup for this weekend!",Chelsea,Yes,jargdy0,t1_jarbt9k
"I would go back to the back 3 he used in 8 of 11 games to start his Chelsea career, of which we inly lost once, and most of the last 2 years at Brighton.

&#x200B;

Play 4-3-1-2.

RJ - Silva - Kouli - Cucu

Kante - Enzo - Mount

Felix 

Sterling - Aubma

&#x200B;

When attacking Shift RJ up the pitch and turn Cucu to a LCB in a 3.  Formation turns into a 3-1-3-2-1.

Enzo

RJ-  Kante- Mount

I trust these players to perform. Sub on Mudryk, Madueke for explosiveness. Give Davido Fofana a chance. Players to rotate with Wesley Fofana, Chilwell, Badishile, Hall, Kovacic, Zakaria, RLC, Chukwuemenka, Ziyech.

&#x200B;

Get rid and don't waste time giving chances to:

&#x200B;

Chalobah (can't defend 1vs1), Azpi (finished), Gallagher (good shot + tenacity, but that's all he's shown), Havertz (jack of no traits, pressing and heading merchant, offers nothing to the game), Pulisic (lost his explosiveness and pace).

&#x200B;

Job done.",Chelsea,Yes,jars73z,t1_jarbt9k
"Subtract: Slonina (loan), Azpilicueta, Koulibaly and/or Chalobah, Chuk (loan), Zakaria, Loftus-Cheek, Gallagher, Hall (loan), Hutchinson (loan), potentially Kovacic, Felix, Ziyech, Pulisic, Broja, Aubameyang, Fofana (loan).

A lot of work to do but pretty straight forward decisions. 

Add: Gusto, Nkunku, Colwill, #6, #8 potentially, #9",Chelsea,Yes,jarajme,t1_jar5d4o
"I’ll take a swing. 
1st- I would let Bettinelli’s contract expire, extend Kante, let Felix’s loan expire, and make Zakaria permanent.

2nd- I would sell Chalobah(20), Gallagher(35), RLC(10), Ziyech(20), Pulisic(35), Aubamayang(8)
And possibly sell Mendy, Azpi, Koulibaly, Cucurella, and Kovacic dependent on fee, contract talks, and interest in staying.

3rd- Bring Nkunku, Gusto, Colwill(loan), and Maatsen(loan) in to the squad and loan out Hall, Chukwuemeka, Hutchinson, Fofana, and some of the reserve players possibly. And possibly bring in a GK, CDM, and ST dependant on sales with Kobel, Ugarte, and Oshimen being the top targets. 

That would leave the squad as follows:

Gk: Kepa, Slonina, Mendy?, and a potential buy

Lb: Chilwell, Maatsen, Cucurella?

Rb: Reece, Gusto, Azpi?

Cb: Silva, Benoit, Fofana, Colwill, Koulibaly?

Cdm/Cm: Enzo, Kante, Zakaria, Kovacic?, and a potential buy

Cam: Nkunku, Mount

Lw: Mudryk, Sterling

Rw: Madueke

St: Havertz, Broja, and a potential buy. 


That would leave the squad at between 19 and 26 player, dependent on fringe transfers. And give us good depth without overloading our squad.",Chelsea,Yes,jarfcsw,t1_jar5d4o
"Ziyech, Pulisic, Bettinelli and Chalobah out. I don't want Pulisic out because he is genuinely so direct and our best goalscorer from the wings but he simply isn't a starter for most managers and he seems to not like when he doesn't start plus injured a lot.",Chelsea,Yes,jar8u9u,t1_jar5d4o
"Felix and Zakaria are as of now not set to be part of our squad. Surely Ziyech and Auba find homes after we tried to sell them this window, and they are not really featuring. Have to think we aren't carrying that many keepers next year. I assume Slonina goes out on loan, we sell Mendy or perhaps both. That's 5-6 that I think are almost certain.

In the probably section I would assume Pulisic is gone. Hall and Hutchinson probably aren't featuring regularly. Either on loan or playing limited minutes. Broja will be out for the start of the season right? And then I would guess we lose at least one of Kova, Mount, Gallagher, or Chuk through sale or loan. Possibly 2. That's another 4-6 I think and gets us down to a pretty manageable number.

Some possibilities on top of that for loans or sales depending on who comes in (Havertz, Chaloba, Kepa, Fofana, RLC, Hall, Cucu). Don't think any of those are likely, but things happen fast sometimes in football.",Chelsea,Yes,jarcn9i,t1_jar5d4o

">Half the starting line up change between some games, some players start a game but can't even find a place on the bench in the next one,

There's a lot to rightly criticize Potter for, but I just don't agree with this over-rotation argument. I've followed his reasoning for squad decisions closely all season and I'm very sure that about 80-90% of his rotation is directly or indirectly caused by injuries, illnesses and other such issues. We have simply had an unprecedented injury crisis and players are not just fully available or fit just because they're not completely out anymore.

And especially given the absolutely absurd amount of injuries we've had, I fully respect that Potter is prioritizing their fitness over his own future. He could have thrown Reece, Silva, etc. in against Southampton but the medical department flagged injury risks so he didn't involve them. Fair play imo, and there's a good chance we'll be thanking him for his careful management of key players next season - even if he himself won't be here.",Chelsea,Yes,jaqdo13,t1_jaqcnm5

"It's an effect of years of recruitment and squad mismanagement. Look back at the days of yore, when we were top scorers in the league. We had tons of goal scorers across the whole squad. We had the PL's best ever scoring midfielder, center backs with elite scoring records, and at times like 4 established recognized strikers in the squad. Hell, Ancelotti even started 3 strikers at once some games. Our recruitment over the last 10 years or so to rebuild that 1st gen squad has just been really bad, especially at replacing lost goal scorers. When we do sign a striker, it's the wrong fit and we ship off 2-3 other strikers to make room for the big signing. We've more recently tried to be more fashionable and not use bona fide strikers, but we haven't supplemented with actual goal scoring wingers and midfielders. Goal scoring is hard. You need specialists. Lampard did actually try and address it a bit with the profile of players we recruited under him, but neither him nor higher ups in recruitment got the details right.

But it's not really enough of an excuse for Potter. He is still performing far below where this squad should be and below the level managers before him. The question is now, how does he rectify it? Should he change to far more attacking tactics in hope to score goals but potentially concede ugly scorelines? Or just continue with low output but hope players can slowly grow enough confidence to at least reach the mediocre # of goals we could expect?",Chelsea,Yes,jarypty,t1_jarfpw6

The next game Ziyech started again, Fofana and Chalobah were not part of the squad and Aubameyang, who was left out from the UCL squad instead of an injured player or Chukwuemeka, was on the bench and was subbed in as a goal scoring hope. On the other hand Chukwuemeka who was supposed to be a player the club wanted to integrate into the first team squad this season and who was preferred over Auba for the UCL list, didn't find himself a squad spot in the last two games.",Chelsea,Yes,jaqsbrl,t1_jaqdo13

">How does Datro Fofana start one game for us and look alright

I know the sub was wanking over his two real involvements in the game, but he wasn't good and Potter basically said as much after the game. His positioning was a mess, he wasn't available in our buildup from the back and it showed... or, well, didn't. He also didn't really press or do anything else. Basically, he produced exactly the kind of performance every non-Havertz striker has produced for us in recent years. Gets the ball occasionally, does something that looks exciting, but in reality he was a passenger for most of it and there was zero substance to his game. Instantly improved massively when Havertz came on. 

>What's with switching between Ziyech and Madueke every other week?

Neither has done well enough to nail down the spot + rotation? I reckon it'll be Sterling RW for the most part now, with Mudryk LW. But that's basically the only position he's rotated a bit too much, and it's also the one where (in Sterling's absence) it was the one position where it isn't clear who the starter should be. I can forgive that.",Chelsea,Yes,jaqxbf7,t1_jaqvedv
"The game where Fofana started, and got pulled off at halftime, then we threw Mount up there for 25 minutes, and then brought Kai on was to me the prime example of this.

"He still would be our highest goal scorer if you took those 2 away, but I was not aware of that tbf haha. He also outperforms his xg this season - I would be surprised if any of our attackers have done that.

Also you’re saying he helped beat a relegation team? We desperately need help with that haha but yeah his stats do make him look a lot better than he is in fairness.

>Neither has done well enough to nail down the spot + rotation?

"I also think Aubameyang should just be Drinkwater'd, but I suppose Potter is trying to keep people on side. If the mood also turns, he's basically losing the only argument the owners keep stressing (players still behind him).

I also think Fofana > Aubameyang for the bench, but I don't feel particularly strongly about it. Neither should play, Sterling false 9 should be the backup option to Kai imo. 


>And so that means he should alternate them then? What good is going to come of that, we'd be better off giving one of them a run of games.

Well, need to consider that Madueke can't play in the CL. So Ziyech in for Dortmund was necessary, but shutting Madueke out completely would be really harsh (especially because Ziyech wasn't even supposed to be here anymore). So I kinda get some of that. Should be Sterling RW from on though, with Madueke rotating in at times. Ziyech should be out now, he has no future here and we don't need him anymore to plug the gap at RW.",Chelsea,Yes,jaqzais,t1_jaqyoy5

Probably a bad idea by me to muddy the discussion but I always can't help but compare it to Mount who appears to be *hated* at times despite being a key player for us in multiple seasons. Yeah his form has tanked this season for sure, and he should be dropped, but the hate around him goes way further than that and yet a player like Havertz who has objectively been worse over the last 3 years still gets put in so many peoples favoured line ups both now and for next season.

"That's understandable, I should have clarified that I am a Mount supporter through and through. I agree that Mount gets entirely too much hate from our fans, and it is terrible to see.

To me, it is hard to use statistics to back up Havertz poor performances when he is always played out of position for so long. When he does play in position, the striker is terrible. Idk mate, I really don't have a solid argument 🤣.

- do we want a short-term manager that would inevitably fallout with the fans and players? He is not the man manager he once was

We played like shit under Tuchel the second half of last season, started this season unlucky but bang average as well. 

The same shit that is happening now was happening under Tuchel. 1-0 or 0-0. Know who the top scorer was under Tuchel? Sterling. When did our season start to naked cliff dive? When sterling and Pulisic went out against City. 

It wasn't fun watching Tuchels team either and I'm still so shocked why so many ""fans"" are screaming his name. Love TT and appreciate the job he did coming in and naturally winning the CL and CWC, and getting cheated against Liverpool for another trophy but he wasn't flying high and breaking necks for the final 6 months of his tenure. 

Im not Potter in, I haven't seen anything from him that said ""yeah, this dude is the tits"" so far just a boob. But they (the players) are doing the same shit they did with Tuchel, trying to dribble the ball into the net. 

Potter is here and there have been many a changes, this sub is so depressing and ugly at the moment. Feels like the blue flag is on the ground and being trampled on just for trampling sake.

"What's the general consensus on the left-back situation? We have Cucurella, Chilwell and Maatsen heading into next season there.

Cucurella obviously in the worst form of his career so far, a verdict still needs to be reached with Chilwell following his injuries, and Maatsen has looked exciting albeit in the tier below.

\- Can Chilwell keep fit and return to playing at a higher level?

\- Will Cucurella find his form next season and be the player we first purchased?

\- Is Maatsen worth investing some faith into, considering his contract expires next summer and he could be useful towards FFP?

Tough decisions to make. 

I'd hate to lose Maatsen personally. I think Cucurella is useful for different tactical setups, but his form this year has been concerning - but no surprise considering his personal circumstances and the overall performances of the team.

It just blows my mind that we're able to see after less than half a season that Potter isn't it, but in 3 years, multiple positions, 3 different managers, there are sections of the fan base that still think Havertz is going to suddenly come good.


It doesnt matter to them that we have years of evidence that he is not good. That he has 17 goals and 7(!) assists in 79 premier league appearances. They shrug off that over 3 seasons his xa is 5.7 and his xg is 20.4. In 3 seasons he has created 6 big chances - the man they want to be the creative force behind a striker. The guy who has been caught offside more times than anyone jn the league, who has given away more fouls than anyone in the league.


We have played him on the right, as an 8, as a 10, as a 9, and he has *never* looked Chelsea quality. We have been hoodwinked by the German generational talent, £70m down the drain, and it's about time everyone comes to accept that and stops makong line ups with him in.

"We had Zouma playing in defensive midfield lol. Papyy Djiboldji (I know I got it wrong) was our 4th choice CB. I don't even remember if we had a proper backup to Costa/Fabregas/Matic. Granted the first 11 was much better than the current one, but we haven't had this much quality depth in ages. It was just a freak season and you can't just put the entire blame on Jose as the board definitely tried their best to not improve the squad that summer.

As for your other points, if the problems really are this simple as trimming a bloating squad and continuing to play our 100M worth young players, he's done that already when he came back in 2012-13 (look at the prior results before he arrived and then how we changed), and how well he set that Real Madrid team for the next few seasons or so. 

No manager is perfect and I am not saying Jose should be our #1 choice but he's done this sort of rebuild before. Has the balls to drop and cut loose those not needed and create mentality monsters out of youth.",Chelsea,Yes,jalskcm,t1_jaljd5j
"Good podcast as usual from them. They were both fans of Potter as well when he was appointed so it was funny when Jules ripped into him lol.

Gab made a good point that there is nothing to gain from sacking him until we're close to relegation troubles but again we're only 10 points ahead of an abject Everton side. Any more draws or losses in the next 2 crucial games and he should be sacked imo.",Chelsea,Yes,jalrgut,t1_jall085
"I’m tired of pretending that if Tuchel were still in charge, we’d look this bad. To everyone saying we were shit for half a season, please find me one time since Potter has taken over, where we’ve played as good as we did against Madrid at their own park. We beat a Milan team with 10 changes to their first XI in our most emphatic win under Potter. 

Not too mention the reasoning for the slide in the second half is due to much more than just injuries (of which we had a lot of) and more due to the sanctions, unpredictability of the clubs future, players making deals not knowing whether CFC would even be in the league the following season.

Our poor form now is because of: injuries, too many players. According to the excuse machine that’s constantly spit out. Please find me where Potter has had to deal with the club being sanctioned and not knowing how his players will be paid or how they’ll travel to away games? 

People complain about no nuance in this sub and then try to discredit our prior success by saying “we were just as shit under Tuchel”. How many times have we scored 1 goal in a month under Tuchel? How many times did we go 2/15 under Tuchel? 

We are Shit because of the manager and people who like to pretend that the club had been shit for over a year, have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. Nearly 30% of our points have come from Tuchel, in 6 games where he was in charge. In 18 games since Potter has been appointed, we’ve scored 21 points.

He should’ve been sacked after Soton and we will be out of everything this time next week, so by that point why even sack him.",Chelsea,Yes,janqwbo,t1_jan5y96
"We played awesome football under Tuchel, in fact we beat the best in the world to win the UCL, honestly the 343 system and the tactical prowess that tuchel installed in this team was unbeatable. That's why he saw the future in a 343 with the quality of our wing backs, we only needed to strengthen some key positions in midfield and defense. 

Yet you only remember the ugly and the bad after the heartbreaking loss   to RM despite us winning in the Bernabéu last season. That was due to lots of reasons, the main ones being that lots of players checked out mentally like Christensen, rudiger and most of our attackers, plus crippling injuries all over.

I also knew there was a system: just the issue was it wasn't working well.

Chilwell just needs to get consistent reps again before we can truly get a good grasp of where he is post-injury. Again, no real decision to be made right now.

Maatsen has looked promising in the Championship but also untried at the top level. Like Chilwell he needs a period of consistent football at this level to get a proper feel for where he's truly at. 

I think we can quite easily go into next season with all three in the squad, and it probably wouldn't be the worse decision to make given Chilwell's injury woes.

There are some weaknesses with that formation that has to do with our players at the moment. Reece and Chilwell are yet to return to their forms as they've had a great deal of injuries to overcome recently. RLC and Cucurella are not ideal wing-backs. The former is best as a midfielder, also poor at providing width; while the latter is a conservative FB. In the front 3, there's no one to provide goal threats in the 6 yd.

">Sport doesn’t work like that. Hansi Flick, the guy people want to replace Potter, never won anything. He replaced a respected coach in Niko Kovac and instantly formed a connection. They won the Champions League. 

Flick is a unique situation though because he was part of Bayern's staff for a while. He knew the players inside out and they trusted him after having worked with him. Same as Terzic at Dortmund. It's why I still have some doubts over Flick at other clubs - he didn't reinvent the wheel at Bayern, he simply played to their strengths that he knew perfectly well. It was a great squad that just needed to go back to what it did best. He won't have that luxury anywhere else and I'm not sure he'd do as well.

>Tuchel’s didn’t have the backing of many players and it didn’t work out on the pitch.

Uh, who says that? Plenty adored Tuchel. The only ones who have been vocal about having issues with him are notorious underperformers - Lukaku, Werner, Pulisic. Even now there are mentions in some reports that there are still elements of the dressing room who miss Tuchel.

The sanctions and selling and all that stuff, that's once in a lifetime for sure. Tuchel handled that. We also got spanked a few times in April, notably the 4-1 Brentford embarrassment and then I think we only won ONE game in May. This form continued at the start of the current season. That's all I'm saying about Tuchel, we were in a bad way before this season even kicked off and then had some embarrassing losses at the start.

"I watched both of them at youth level for us, with Colwill the potential was obvious but I had doubts over Maatsen because of his size.

It's worth remembering that Maatsen has had two loans prior to Burnley, at Charlton in League One and Coventry in the Championship, whereas Colwill stepped straight into the Championship with Huddersfield.

That being said, I've loved his role under Kompany and think he would be brilliant for us there. He's proved that he can play high and wide as a wingback, arrive into the box from the left, as well as invert into midfield in a 2-3-5 build-up. He has a lot of promise for a good tactician.

Even if he needs one more loan once Burnley are promoted, I think it would be worth handing him a boosted contract renewal with guarantees of a place in the squad the following season if he performs well. That would give us another year to evaluate Cucurella and Chilwell as well.

I think Hall will be out on loan next year as we're high on numbers and he is one of the easier names to move on for the season. He'll also need the playing time to develop, but I'm excited for him.

It would be a shame to lose Chilly but he is definitely the easier of the pair to move on, with reported interest from City. He's just so likeable and proved a lot of people wrong here, he definitely feels like one of us. 

I like Cucurella too though, he has a lot of tactical versatility and I wanted us to sign him (not at that price), but god he's been awful. It can only get better though.",Chelsea,Yes,jaoi0ju,t1_jaogam1

"But why can't Felix play striker? I ask after watching Havertz play striker for 2/3 years. Felix can be every bit and better than Havertz at striker (and is a placeholder for Nkunku in the long term anyway). Havertz as a free-roaming attacking mid in a narrow 3, behind Felix might work. Hell, Mount looked great in that AM role. Sterling is ideal for that third attacking left-sided role too, and can switch with Felix, but Mudryk/Madueke will need some work. Mudryk was also a LM who likes dropping deep to pick up the ball and drive, and he has the technical ability to adapt to that role in my view. I just want to play Havertz ""in his natural position"". Since he isn't creative enough to be a lone AM, this way we use him the best imo with 2 other quick forwards around him.

While injuries to wingbacks mean we'll have to play lesser options there, its still the best formation for the team as a whole.

"Even in the worse forms under Tuchel we were scoring one goal a calendar month. We have scored the least amount of goals in all professional leagues in all of England since November. That’s not just bad form, that’s just an all time bad production from our squad.

Now I’m not chanting to have Tuchel back and I believe he left because the owners didn’t like him, and that’s fine. We can let the past be with Tuchel and leave it at that, but we can’t just do that when it’s convenient for people’s arguments. The same people saying “TUCHEL ISNT COMING BACK, BACK THE CLUB” are the same ones saying “WE WERE JUST AS BAD UNDER TUCHEL”. Which is just a gross over exaggeration of the actual events.

And we were in a bad run of form in May, in the heat of takeover and sanctions talk. Geez, I wonder why the team performed so badly then. Was it because important club leader Rudiger was on the brink of leaving for Madrid because we couldn’t offer him a new deal if we wanted to? Other players as well who didn’t know what the future has in store for them? If anybody should get the benefit of the doubt it’s Tuchel who win major trophies with us and navigated us during arguably one of If not the hardest time in the clubs history.

And I agree we should’ve scored more points under Tuchel, and we should have 2 more points after we got robbed against Spurs. And while I love the club and I want to back them, this manager isn’t emblematic of what this club stands for. Above all else, we are club that seeks to achieve the highest honors every season. We are at the point that people are begging to score, not even a win. That’s how desperate times have gotten and we were never that bad under Tuchel, or even any other manager in recent memory. Under peak Sarri hate, we were never this bad. 

An all time terrible managerial change, one that will probably be remembered for how badly it turned out for us and some want us to keep backing Potter. He has achieved nothing of note to afford him this patience and that’s not to discredit his coaching achievements, but it’s not to the standard of this club.  He’s performing as well as he always had, just last year he was at Brighton where no one expected anything and he could get away with these terrible runs of form.

Félix have the physical limitations to thrive in the PL as a striker. If we shoehorn him into one, we'll be taking away a great deal of his qualities by the way. 

>Mount looked great in that AM role.

That was before this season.

2. Tuchel was also required to play recruiter, director of football, among a handful of other positions that took over his responsibility as team manager. Directly resulting in performance drop from the team

There's a reason we had one of the best defenses and a 61% win rate when Tuchel was around playing his role as manager. There are also plenty of reasons post TB & Co. why performance dropped when he was forced to move out of his manager role, to wear many different hats.

And that's something that plenty of people around here aren't willing to admit because it's easy to say -- we started the season shit. Mind you 1/3 of the goals scored to date, were under tuchel (he only managed Chelsea for 6 out of the 24 matches played this season). 33% of goals to date from 25% of matches managed

Tuchel wasn't dominating the league at the start of this season; he was also not able to commit the majority of his time to manage the team like he was last season, to get the best out of them.

Havertz is a link up player, who drops into midfield, not a goal scorer.

Because Félix is better at shooting than Havertz doesn't mean he's a striker. We've been forced to play him and Havertz together to interchange due to the notable absentees you mentioned. 

>We haven't used Havertz as anything else but a 9, or a SS with Broja/Auba this season. We've never tried the dual AM with him on the right, and Sterling/Mount/Mudryk, and Felix up top in 3-4-3, which is structurally very different to a 4231 with Havertz up top or on the right.

Perhaps, but like I said earlier, I would prefer the attacking wide threat to come from Mudryk/Noni/Sterling than from James/Chilwell",Chelsea,Yes,jalwgpn,t1_jalulvu

"The highs were great, don’t get me wrong. But great tactics can not hide the shambolic nature of our transfer and scouting policy. I’ve always thought that players are only as good as a system allows. 

Potter has gotten a lot of shit for saying his squad is big, but remember tuchel had the same problem; think of it this way did we have a proper starting 11 under him?(even before injuries). Tuchel was always bandaid and we got carried away with the highs he brought about.",Chelsea,Yes,jaln6we,t1_jallyrg

Again there's nothing wrong as long as you get desired performances and results but it doesn't make sense to keep on playing them when you have already invested 100s of Millions on their replacements already. 

The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced of the incompetency of the nexus of Potter-Boehly-Eghbali when it comes to squad building. Created their own problems when there could well have been simpler solutions.",Chelsea,Yes,jaluu5t,t1_jalu4pj
"I do see your points, but I kinda disagree, our best wide attackers are indeed RJ/Chilwell. I've yet to see our wingers provide a consistent threat from wide like our wingbacks do.

Also, can we try it before we knock it? Felix as a striker I mean. Can't say for sure that it would or would not work, but I think we can both agree that Havertz doesn't work as a striker. Even during our CL run, Timo was the LW/Inside forward who created space for Havertz regularly. Sterling can do that role for Felix. Havertz is as much a shoe-horn as Felix at striker, we need to try something different, cos whatever we're doing now just isn't working.",Chelsea,Yes,jalxkr4,t1_jalwgpn

I think the rebuild was done too quickly. That first window was a piece of shit (17 levels imo) and the winter one was good for the players we got but too many at the same time as whilst adding to a bloated squad and not having a well defined structure in place just makes everyone look worse than they are. 

I'm sure it will come good (overall structure: squad building and player improvements etc) but we have to take a hit at the moment whilst they see what they can do to fix the mess they've caused, as you mentioned. Time will tell whether they stick with Potter or not.",Chelsea,Yes,jalvng0,t1_jaluu5t

Second season was initially mount Lukaku and Havertz then Lukaku/Werner got injured.

"Yeah it's really tough. Based on his record with us it should be a no brainer to get someone else in. 

Personally, I really liked how his Brighton team played in the last couple seasons. Their understanding between each other and how quick they were able to win the ball back and progress up the pitch was really good. They had a really bad scoring record though, which looks to have made its way here also (which is actually mind boggling because how is that the manager's fault yet it's followed him from one club to another). 

With better players it made sense that we should be able to replicate that style of play and improve the level of finishing in much better time than what's actually played out. I will defend that I think he's a good coach and does have the ability but with a record like his at Chelsea, it's very very difficult to prove it, even to myself at times.",Chelsea,Yes,jam1f22,t1_jalxpqn

Against villa it was lukaku ziyech havertz and Saul-jorgi 

Against spurs it was lukaku Kai mount and kova-jorgi

Against city it was lukaku- Werner and kante-jorgi-kova

"Midfield pair generally was a rotation strategy between Kante Jorginho and Kovacic, RLC coming in every now and then. Tuchels done that across his entire time as manager so nothing new. 

With the midfield you have 3 first team midfielders for 2 positions, rotation is expected. Saul came in Vs villa because it was supposedly an easy win game and he wanted to incorporate him into the squad(since we loaned him for a season)

City was a tactical tweak, the rest I'd say was rotation of a big squad. But you can see that in those 5 games the front 3 generally was Kai mount and Lukaku.",Chelsea,Yes,jam24we,t1_jalvcra

"Apparently, Potter is failing at identifying and implementing strategies and tactics at the most fundamental level of football.

Watched the players with the ball in promising situations without knowing what to do next is quite disheartening. More often in attack, there is no designated player on the wing to hold width with substantial threats. All of our wingers have already tasted injury this season alone. And when they do, they seem to not know whether to go inside or outside, cross or cut-in and shoot. In the box, we don't have a stable amount of hold-up play anymore. Not even Aubameyang is renowned for that quality. Don't want to talk about Ziyech now. Havertz has already become a shadow of himself. Félix is trying to conjure up chances through his skills but that alone has proven not to be enough and sustainable in the long run. Another conundrum is Sterling. How do we utilize him in line-up? Should he play as an out-and-out winger or as an inside-forward? If he plays as the latter, he will be needing width (wing-back) for support. It is glaring that Noni and Murdryk need more PL experience to set themselves up. 

Despite having a bloated midfield, we appear to be struggling there as there's less physicality available. Too many CMs with different playing styles would give any manager headache. From an unavailable Kante and Kovacic to the to the out-of-form Mount and Loftus-Cheek to the inexperienced Gallagher, Hall and Chukwuemeka. How is Potter addressing this now as well as at the end of the season? Some might clamour a return to a midfield 3 to accommodate the majority, but is that enough? I personally think Mase should improve as a CM or forget about Chelsea as it stands. Also that Potter should be playing Enzo higher up the pitch with someone being him (Zakaria/RLC/Chalobah) while we get someone of quality in the summer. 

Defensively, we seem to be better. Now that T. Silva is out till April, can Potter ask the team to be braver and proactive defensively by playing a high line because we're pretty shit at doing that at the moment? If he is opting for that, the defence is going to be needing a ton of help from the attack. Now is the most opportune time to for Fofana and Badiashile to build chemistry. Will the LB be Cucurella or Chilwell as the latter is yet to regain himself? Do we buildup with a 3-2 with inverted FBs or do we stick with the 4-2? How worse would Chalobah perform in the DM? 

The amount of coordination and synchronization in the recent games is appalling. It's like we do not have a plan for a match. It's dreadful and embarrassing. The team needs urgency and character. Potter needs to do something.",Chelsea,No,jaieojk,t3_11evx6c

"All the hinting of Kante fixing our team once he's healthy again reminds me of when our defence was shit under Frank and we all fooled ourselves into thinking it'll all be ok once Rudiger is back (and it wasn't).

Even when healthy Kante wasn't looking like the same player he was before, and now he'll be recovering from a long term injury and very long time away from the pitch. If we're being kind and saying that maybe his decline was because of this injury and that he just needed this break to finally recover it'll still take him a while to get back up to speed and even then I don't think he'll be what turns this team around. As great as Kante is, even at his best he couldn't save these performances by himself. We'll likely improve, and again that's assuming he comes back as the same player we saw years ago, but not as much as we'd hope.

I know people are just looking for reasons to be optimistic and I can't fault that but please don't get your hopes up too high. If you just want to see him playing again then great because I do too but if you think he'll single handedly turn our season around I very much doubt it.",Chelsea,No,jaiel83,t3_11evx6c
"Ways that Chelsea can score a goal:

&#x200B;

Most likely: Leeds error leading to easy goal or Leeds own goal.

Enzo Fernandez shot from outside the box. He has a launched a few that came close and seems up for it.

Ziyech cross to Havertz. Ziyech has the ability to cross the ball but lately Chelsea seems to be heavily favoring the left side. Havertz rarely ever scores from headers.

&#x200B;

Sterling cuts in from the left and shoots across goal. He has scored this way and has attempted. Just comes to mind.

Potter's allegedly implied it's tough to train with the big squad but if it's that much of an issue, or if certain players sulking in the dressing room are that much of a problem, then you have to be brave and make the call to exclude them for the next couple of months before they're sold.

People still talk about him as if he's still that player from 2015-2020 or even that 2021 CL run but I worry about giving him a long contract considering the circumstances and don't think he's the shining ray of hope that will completely fix our season.

 I hope I'm wrong though. Maybe his decline was because of an ongoing injury issue and all he needed was this long rest? Who knows.",Chelsea,Yes,jaiftbr,t1_jahv86d
This popular opinion on this sub constantly bounces between “We should sell Kante” and “Kante is the answer to all our problems.” Imo Kante isn’t going to really make a significant change in our team. I don’t think any one player really will tbh,Chelsea,Yes,jai3swf,t1_jahv86d
"We should consider ourselves lucky that we witnessed Kante in his prime at Chelsea. I think at that time he was one of the best players that ever played the game. You cannot rate him high enough, he was just a cheat code. If he was in form (and for a couple of years this was the norm) you simply would not lose. But there is no doubt he is declining. His injuries where piling up in the last season already and when he was fit he often didn't look that sharp anymore. Understandable because it was always an incredibly physical way of playing the game from him. I would love form him to have a few more good years but I am afraid that we might have just seen most of the good games he has ever played. Let's hope that I'm wrong.",Chelsea,Yes,jai6996,t1_jahv86d

"You got me good. Never expected you to be one of the people wanting Mourinho back so I was shocked reading the start.

I wanted Sarri to stay but also wasn't too cut up about letting him go at the time since, despite a good start and eventual improvement in play near the end of the season (though closing the season out with a run of pretty poor league results if I remember right), that middle period when we looked terrible raised enough doubts in my mind. He did enough to warrant more time and players better suited for him and that was without the hindsight that's only made that clearer. It is what it is though and there's no way he's coming back.

What I really hated was how he was treated by the fanbase. Both match-going and online. I felt that his treatment by the fans was terrible and it remains a mystery to me why so many hated him so much.",Chelsea,Yes,jagtjd2,t1_jagmqy8
I'm actually not surprised no one has brought up his name here but Id say this squad is actually tailor made for his style (barring a striker perhaps) and he can mould the squad into a CL side. He did that with far less in the past IMO.,Chelsea,Yes,jagvqqi,t1_jagmqy8
"Was actually quite excited to see how sarri was gonna build on his first season

Had us transitioning away from the counter attack football of conte and mourinho and we saw the beginnings of a passing, pressing system.

Definitely a lot of interesting things to see how they developed. Feel this current team suits him well too; a lot of technical players who can play 1 or 2 touch and move well off the ball 

Sterling would be perfect for the rw spot for sarri, mudryk is surprisingly a good passer and makes good runs in behind. Felix would likely be his striker

But then you struggle to fit in nkunku next season as sarri loves his 3 man midfield",Chelsea,Yes,jagnlrw,t1_jagmqy8

"At this point the idea of all the new signings fitting in and performing instantly is as good an idea as Potter being the right man for the job.

I agree with the sentiment that we need to go back to a back 3 like under Tuchel and allow our wingbacks to play to the best of their abilities and see this season out.

Also, might be a controversial opinion for this sub but I'd also involve Mount and Gallagher as much as possible to solidify our pressing off the ball and raise the intensity a bit.",Chelsea,Yes,jah0qyk,t1_jagluie

And Sheffield United apparently…,Chelsea,Yes,jajik8w,t1_jaje8cw
Yes a new Midtable Club. It's just the death throes of Romans Chelsea fading. We will be a 60-65 point team for the next 4 years until Potter's contract runs out unless the board extends him because he made one Fa Cup final.,Chelsea,Yes,jahwlif,t1_jahmxce
"Yes, Potter doesn't have clear tactics and our passing map looks like a toddler scribbling lines on a piece of paper, because we have new staff at the club. Not the fact that he's clearly a midtable manager who is performing at the same level he's always performed at.

Please don't be a clown, you're not fooling anyone with this joke of a narrative. Doesn't surprise me one bit that you have several comments defending Potter.",Chelsea,Yes,jahph6w,t1_jahmxce

"Or a simple explanation, they dont want to play for Potter.",Chelsea,Yes,jagfu80,t1_jagekbm
Leading Chelsea isn't the same as leading small clubs these are millionaires set for life If you don't have  a inspired leader as  a coach they lose focus and won't perform and it is going to continue like this until Potter is sacked. Just shows how good of a coach Pep is and it isn't only about the money City spent,Chelsea,Yes,jagxsfp,t1_jagekbm
"I made this point when he was hired. That we've seen all sorts of talented coaches at the Bridge and the ones that succeeded didn't do so just because they were way more talented than other. 

The intangible qualities like acting like a real leader and inspiring/motivating the players just that little bit to get the best out of them is equally important. Again those sort of coaches don't last a long while but will give you a successful cycle of 2-3 years. 

Potter might be a talented coach but if he's unable to inspire Champions League winners and players with understandably big egos to buy into his methods, there's just no point. He won't be the first hyped up promising manager to fail at those simple aspects.",Chelsea,Yes,jah1q6l,t1_jagekbm
"Confidence & mentality is a huge part of football. They are good players but at rock bottom. And the manager isn't really helpful.

Similar stuff happened under Mourinho in 2015/16 with better players. Mourinho was great but even he couldn't get them out of the rut.",Chelsea,Yes,jagg14r,t1_jagekbm
Whatever Potter wants is not coming out as intended in our new 4231. Tuchel coached us with clear passing patterns which over time got figured out and it became hard for us to score. Potter is trying to coach something more free flowing which is extremely difficult with the bloated squad. You need a set squad of players to understand each other on a deep level instead of chopping and changing all the time. Players like Ziyech and Aubameyang and even K2 who have a high chance of not being here next season should be nowhere near the squad. Send them a bloody Conte text and tell them thanks for the seasono but you're not in the plans,Chelsea,Yes,jagtjt1,t1_jagekbm
"Everything is at fault for our season right now. It’s not just down to one thing. It’s an extremely complex predicament that’s been bubbling since that game at home v Leeds in December 2021. It’s a little bit of the players exhausted/loss of confidence, it’s a little bit of players who have all but been told they have no future here beyond this season giving up, it’s a little bit of players who wanted out last summer and not getting their move away just coasting to the finish line, it’s a little bit of Tuchel who lost the dressing room, it’s a little bit of Potter who was a competent coach in August now approaching this job utterly clueless like he was a fan off the street by abandoning his principles and reaching for solutions that aren’t there, it’s a little bit of the massive upheaval at the club both on and off the pitch in a very short amount of time, it’s also the fact that the main core of existing players have played the most games in Europe since 2020 with very little reprieve in between have reached their wits end going into this season. 

It’s silly for anyone to pin this on one person manager or player when quite frankly it’s been all of it. I’ve been watching football a long time and strictly speaking for this season, I do not know how you fix it. Sacking Potter isn’t the reprieve many think it will be. We’ve already seen these players lose to Southampton and Leeds before Potter. Potter deserves sacking don’t get me wrong after the Spurs game but Tuchel couldn’t squeeze anymore out of these guys and that’s before we got the January transfers who are at differing fitness levels and are struggling to mesh with each other. It’s a bad situation that has no immediate fix. The best anyone can hope is that we get through to the end of this season, mass clear out of players by any means necessary and have a workable squad in preseason. That’s Vivell’s responsibility this summer. A total failure if the squad numbers aren’t cut down for Potter or the new manager.",Chelsea,Yes,jagm7k8,t1_jagekbm

"Under Tuchel Chilwell started scoring more goals because he'd move inwards more and play inverted(in the 21/22 season). I think that they don't have to always overlap or always underlap as long as there's understanding between the two.

That being said mudryk needs to be better in 1 Vs 1 situations. You could see how Sterling was leaving Emerson and Romero for dead 1 Vs 1 but outside of a 37 year old Milner I've seen nothing of the sort from mudryk.",Chelsea,Yes,jaidi8x,t1_jaictmj
"The thing is that Mudryk needs a player like Chilwell who will get forward and overlap, otherwise, teams will be able to double mark Mudryk and get the ball off him easily(like we saw with Cucurella and why he didn’t get the ball as much vs West Ham). He had a similar type of LB at Shaktar, but the thing is he knew when to overlap/when to sit back. I think the more Chilwell and Mudryk play together, the more they will figure this out, and right now, it is merely a chemistry issue. Just my thoughts though.",Chelsea,Yes,jaimzlw,t1_jaictmj
"My crazy thought of the day is to wonder if Mudryk could play as a striker. He’s two-footed, just as fast as Timo, but a much better dribbler and shooter, with the same questionable first touch though. Playing him as the 9 would let Felix play as the LW, Mount or Kai as the 10, and Sterling as the RW. Or you let Sterling play his favored LW, Felix in middle and shoe-horn Mount/Kai/Madueke as the RW or maybe Pulisic when he’s back (or Pulisic subs on for the LW)

CBs would be really wary of Mudryk’s pace in behind so it would probably open up space for the 10.",Chelsea,Yes,jairawg,t1_jaictmj

No one goes half a season with 2 wins, not even relegation teams take that in PL nowdays.

Tired of people acting like Potter can claim anything even if miracle happens, Potter himself has said the results are bad, and fans have been fair. The match going fans were still singing for the team till Southampton game, even last game. Let's not put the shit on fans and put it where it belongs. Southampton is looding to teams 2 tiers below them and dominating us, let's put the egg where it fits.",Chelsea,Yes,jaji2we,t1_jajd2ub

We're clearly struggling with the implementation of the 4231 lineup so go back to basics with 3ATB which the team should be more comfortable with. If Potter (I think he's a dead man walking already) survives then he can get his 4 ATB ideas across during the summer.,Chelsea,Yes,jagsg5p,t1_jagqd18
"I think it's too late, the owners made their choice to stick with him now. This season is finished. There's no way we get past dortmund and the rest of the season is gonna be friendlies.

"I pray we don’t get him, his sides are insufferable to watch and play relegation tier football. Stack boxes and try to score on a counter attack, inspires no creativity. He’s a legend for what he did fit atlético but they were not Chelsea. 

Makes no sense to spend all that money in the attack to then have him come in. I’d rather take another punt at an unproven manager than have him come here. And I do think he’d struggle here if he came",Chelsea,Yes,jai9nd0,t1_jai3pux

"I see your point but striker is a very difficult position to buy for. It’s that and full backs that are near impossible to find quality options. All the elite strikers aren’t up for sale, they’re a bunch of questionable ones that aren’t worth the money like Vlahovic. Then consider we’re only buying from the u25 age bracket from here on out and our options are even more limited. 

I think the better play would be to just use David Datro Fofana but now he’s on Potter’s bad list in his desperation to turn our form around. What was the point of not loaning him in January when the coach will just bin him after barely playing?",Chelsea,Yes,jaglcyf,t1_jaggs73
My concern is how much he bottled it in big moments with his time in Tottenham. They had a solid team at one point but won nothing.,Chelsea,Yes,jait2hw,t1_jainzd3

When there's a very clear plan for the structure of the team it becomes easier to make those ruthless decisions. Easier for the manager to sell those decisions to the owners too. I think a big part of the issue Potter has is that he didn't seem to have a clear plan in the beginning. He was changing the shape and tactics and lineups every game and trying to assess. While the world cup was going on he must've tried to draw something up and asked the owners to get him some players. But when those ideas didn't click either then he has no clout to make tough decisions with. Squad decisions are now about freshness or who needs a mental break. He's now scrambling for results and just rolling dice with his squad and hoping that some random combination he hasn't tried yet will work.,Chelsea,Yes,jaiqqsc,t1_jaigo9l
"> Maybe Boehly and co don't want him to do that because it hurts their negotiating position when it comes to selling them in the summer but our embarrassing league position is what I'm worried about.

Exactly, we need to put the performances and results on the pitch ahead of transfer values.  
We absolutely need to cut the squad down to 25. Bin Auba and Ziyech. We can also send the younger signings like Carney and D Fofana to the U23 as well. Just explain to them the reasons why, that until we move on some players in the summer they just don't have room in the first team.

That would be splendid. Wouldn't have to read your comments on reddit.,Chelsea,Yes,jak0r0o,t1_jajvgft
I think he will be a positive contribution simply because we don't really have a midfielder that can do what he does.

"Boehly did not buy a club fighting relegation battles like the saudis did with Newcastle. They bought a club who’s finished top 4, for 4 straight seasons, top 6 for the last 25 of 26 seasons.

"I've followed Serie A in general a bit this season, mostly through highlights though, but with an eye on Lazio. Sarri has done well to shore up their biggest problem - their defensive record. They conceded 55 before he came, then 58 in his first season, which was the second worst in the top 10. Now they've got the second best defensive record (and GD) in the league.

They weren't good in the Europa League and dropped out of a group that should have been very doable though.

Sarri is definitely doing a good job there though and they're firmly in the mix for a top 4 spot - even a second place finish isn't impossible, there's no firm difference between the teams placed 2nd to 6th. Only Napoli are clearly out of reach for everyone else.",Chelsea,Yes,jahmc22,t1_jahlaqj

The loan didn’t make any sense in the first place unless Boehly though we were going to push for top 4.,Chelsea,Yes,jai4cab,t1_jahl479
That 15M is wasted regardless if he plays or not. The club also spent 18M on Carney and have homegrown players like Mount and Gallagher who could also play in that position and gather more experience which helps their and the clubs long-term future.

You remember 2015/16? That squad finished 10th, where had they finished the past 4 years? What did they win in 2012? These things happen. No team stays at the top forever. They go through cycles. 

Right now, no one in the top 4, aside from City, have been relevant for several years. We want to pretend that Chelsea had a chance? No fucking way. Where had they finished in the table? When was the last time they won the prem? Losing to Liverpool in two separate cup competitions last year should have explained this team didn’t have what it took to be successful. A rebuild was and is needed.",Chelsea,Yes,jakwree,t1_jakw5kp
"Haha no worries! I have no problem being corrected when I’m wrong. 

I do have a problem with the miserable pricks in this club claiming doom and gloom every 5 seconds, and then being even more hate filled when someone tries to look at the bright side.",Chelsea,Yes,jalyv92,t1_jalsmfd
"Very underrated season, and one that massively contributed to our CL-win. It just gets lost because the brexit-fans wanted to shout about Jorginho and how Sarri wasn't a ""Chelsea-man"" - which we now see again with Potter. The squad he inherited from Conte was awful and he just binned Cahill, Bakayoko, Drinkwater, Morata, Cesc. The push to get a ball-playing goalie was really good, but the board bottled it with Alisson and gave us Kepa instead.   

CHO, RLC, Christensen all had a great season, but injuries ruined it for the first two, and the Jorginho, Kovacic, Kanté midfield is what Tuchel relied on for our CL-win. It was a really nice transition to Lamps as well, as he could then add Mount, Reece, Chilly, Silva, Tammy.   
The way he got Hazard involved was also a major improvement on that last season of Conte. The £130m we then sold him for is maybe the best sale we've ever made.",Chelsea,Yes,jahceyn,t1_jah737g
"Tbf anything is better than under Potter but I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt utterly dejected when we were struggling under Sarri. 

Rob Greene even came out with the stories of how the players literally revolted against the manager and his ideas.",Chelsea,Yes,jah3bsx,t1_jah2inp
To think Barkley was once an important player for the team ffs. Only good thing about the the whole thing was the Barkley memes.,Chelsea,Yes,jai0cn5,t1_jah3r4q
This just isn’t true,Chelsea,Yes,jai59a9,t1_jahaaca
Because he’s currently jobless?,Chelsea,Yes,jahbzqp,t1_jahasr3
Just put a clause that says you’re good as gone if we’re 10th before end of the year.,Chelsea,Yes,jagqj7y,t1_jagqd69
This failed experiment might just lead them to change their minds about it. Hopefully. We can only speculate at this point but I definitely believe a coach with a bigger reputation would sort most of our issues out.,Chelsea,Yes,jah2oh8,t1_jah1xju
"I don't know about worse, but he has underperformed at Roma and with Spain. He did well at Barca, but there are questions over whether that was him or just Barca being a very experienced and talented team (much in the way that Avram Grant and Di Matteo were able to get good results with the spine of those Jose teams). I suspect he is a fine manager, but I don't really know how good he is.",Chelsea,Yes,jai6oyj,t1_jahagxp
i’ve heard a lot of not so good but also watching spain in that world cup match… yikes,Chelsea,Yes,jahcel4,t1_jahagxp
did you watch spain at the world cup,Chelsea,Yes,jahcdqh,t1_jahagxp
"God, don't even bring it up.",Chelsea,Yes,jalp51q,t1_jak8vqj
"To be honest I don't see potter managing 20 points in the last 14 games. 15-16 points for a grand finish of 46 points, 65  points next year is an almost 50% improvement. More than enough improvement  for this regime.",Chelsea,Yes,jai38pp,t1_jai2mff
Do you think you're not incredibly transparent?,Chelsea,Yes,jahtdt5,t1_jahscgn
"Tbf should've had a great assist vs west ham but havertz mistimed his run, other than that though i cant think of anything.",Chelsea,Yes,jak1nnf,t1_jajtp7e
"We’ve missed him on open runs several times where he would’ve had a great chance at scoring. He’s also had several good passes outside of the Liverpool match that could have led to goals for normally functioning teams, but we can’t score so it didn’t happen.",Chelsea,Yes,jajvk4s,t1_jajtp7e
"When the guy who owns the club likes to reinforce his belief in potter 3 times a day, as a player, you can't really say much against him",Chelsea,Yes,jaghfyq,t1_jaggltq
Shouldn’t a healthy Kante fix this problem?,Chelsea,Yes,jahzxyp,t1_jahyx13
"Why the fuck are we playing Ziyech then, when he was already banging outside PSG's door begging to be let in? Lol. This club isn't thinking that far ahead enough. Potter will play whoever he thinks will make him win.",Chelsea,Yes,jahpxi1,t1_jahnlvv
"I guess the season isn't done until we lose to Dortmund.

I think if we do lose to Dortmund more focus should be on getting mounts form back up again as well as bringin chukwuemeka and Gallagher some gametime to see if they can improve (not a fan of Gallagher but aware that he needs gametime even if the aim is to sell him). 

I also understand that nkunku will be offering what Felix supposedly offers in the summer.",Chelsea,Yes,jaihktu,t1_jaih0qr
"Yeah my bad 19, it still close to half a season as I meant.",Chelsea,Yes,jalpugm,t1_jajvbcs
"No you can't make that argument. Because he has only Kante out as major absence now, that happens with any manager, injuries doesn't become zero. If he needs everything perfect for results,then he is shit anyway. And most importantly we aren't where we are, justifiably, we were at the very least top 4 team even with injuries, if we are at this level even after adding 600m worth of players then it's bad, injuries also have gone and we are still getting dominated by managerless 20th team. So no Potter can't justify anything, after going half a season with 2 wins.",Chelsea,Yes,jalproh,t1_jajz3j1
"Yeah, i just dont see how they allow him to get away with it, cause then every player would do this kinda shit, and the amount of charges is huge so im assuming they make an example out of him",Chelsea,Yes,jagonsh,t1_jagn3zf
"Or put Badiashile, Silva and Fofana in defence and allow Chilwell and Reece to go forward. I have more faith in them to score than our attackers. When Kante is back this system becomes even more viable.",Chelsea,Yes,jah2765,t1_jagvr5o
Well I know that if cucu played against spurs he would’ve been scape goated,Chelsea,Yes,jaid83u,t1_jai3d8l
Why don't we get Vincent Kompany he has to start somewhere right.,Chelsea,Yes,jahxcbl,t1_jahetf1
Yeah and they shouldn't fucking get their first big move at Chelsea.,Chelsea,Yes,jahnnh0,t1_jahetf1
i agree with you but everyone has a trauma because of that fraud,Chelsea,Yes,jahk3se,t1_jahetf1
It's harder to judge managers without some inside knowledge as to how they work and what their plans are. That's why we've hired a platoon of directors. Hopefully they get it right.,Chelsea,Yes,jahml4e,t1_jahetf1
"We can still keep Zak as a backup as well, ideally we need 2 DMs anyways.",Chelsea,Yes,jagwjza,t1_jagwe5p
"Maybe money wouldn't be an issue if we didn't spunk money on attackers without sorting our midfield out or pay 15M for a 3 month loan on an attacker who would be lucky to get over 7 G+A.

Lmao if we are starting Zakaria next season, we're in trouble. 

Quite clearly we're chancing it on Kantes fitness while we wait for someone real good to come along.",Chelsea,Yes,jah3aww,t1_jagwe5p
"Soton are going down lol, he won’t be as expensive",Chelsea,Yes,jagx51t,t1_jagwlmg
europe has been gone for a while and look at our january window,Chelsea,Yes,jah3qm0,t1_jah20a8
Rice is good but then they're extending Kante as well. Not sure but I don't think we'll spend big on another midfielder in the summer.,Chelsea,Yes,jai0lv8,t1_jah6985
I've wondered that. Neil Bath I suppose,Chelsea,Yes,jah4wxf,t1_jah019i
Because he scored the winner against us and that's how Boehly picks players,Chelsea,Yes,jah1tzq,t1_jah019i
"Would be a mistake to bring him back anyway. Players downed tools for him, they didn't even bother picking them up when potter arrived. I don't care how bad potter is, our players have been absolute dog shit and should be embarrassed.",Chelsea,Yes,jagt5vp,t1_jagmm2q
"We didn't play sufferball lmao.

I swear man people think managers who focus on defence play the exact same way.

When we played anyone other than man city we tended to dominate the ball or be equal possession wise. How many arsenal games under Tuchel were just them getting scalps from opposition mistakes while we dominated the ball? Same for the United matches under Tuchel 

I don't want Tuchel back but it is 9 year old level of analysis to compare Simeones football to Tuchel because we did a park bus job on man city.",Chelsea,Yes,jaibl5m,t1_jai852u
"Somewhere around the Mou mk 2 squad would have been good. But I feel like we’ve tried to move from that profile around 2011 or so and it’s been a hodgepodge of players. 

I also don’t think he’d get the same leeway as he did in Atleti where he practically brought them to modern success.",Chelsea,Yes,jai8rn6,t1_jai7iox
"Just a phrase, bud. 

I think he'd be an Ok choice. Not my first choice but he makes my top 5 list of managers I'd be happy to hear about joining.",Chelsea,Yes,jaj9lwz,t1_jaj80df
I didn’t say I wanted him to I just said I read that this is a possibility,Chelsea,Yes,jakatdr,t1_jak59zx
"I wasn’t saying the lineup is the same as the one we played, I’m saying the lineup they put out is maybe a couple players away from being a standard PL lineup for them. Almost everyone who started has a significant number of PL minutes. It’s not like they put out a team of kids",Chelsea,Yes,jalueap,t1_jakii86
"Did hazard look average? 

Mahrez would have been brilliant here. 

He’d work under both a counterattacking side and as part of the Sarri side later on",Chelsea,Yes,jahaosf,t1_jaha23g
Highly disagree,Chelsea,Yes,jahc9lb,t1_jaha23g
"Yep you are right. I honestly blanked on him. I'll change it to RLC is probably closes in profile who has actually been available recently. Basically, Kante is replacing RLC, Mount, and Gallagher in the past few months and can do things that none of them can do.",Chelsea,Yes,jaiedys,t1_jaicfmf
"You’re saying it takes time it didn’t take Eddie Howe any time at all to bring Newcastle from relegation battles to top 5. It also didn’t take graham potter anytime to bring chelsea from 4th in October to mid table in March. Boehly has made a string of errors in the short time he has been at the club. You have typed paragraphs and none of them is a good defense of the shit he’s been throwing at the wall

How is 15/16 relevant? That was sandwiched by two title winning seasons. Incomparable to our situation now 

Why are you talking about chelsea catching city? Who’s talking about a title race? We are looking up at brentford atm

The decline you are talking about before potter includes cup finals every season, top 4, and European champions outplaying all our opponents just 2 years ago. also was top of the league last year before Covid and injuries. Fast forward to now least goals scored in England top 4 tiers of football since November - that’s a decline",Chelsea,Yes,jakx2mh,t1_jakwree
They are brainless obviously,Chelsea,Yes,janhwkw,t1_jalyv92
"Yes, but looking back those problems seem insignificant now, the guy at least won games and had us in 3rd.",Chelsea,Yes,jah6hx6,t1_jah3bsx
">Rob Greene even came out with the stories of how the players literally revolted against the manager and his ideas.

Rob Green mostly tells stories to make himself sound important. Which is ironic given that his biggest achievement in football is being third choice goalkeeper for a Sarri side that won the EL.",Chelsea,Yes,jah9xop,t1_jah3bsx
Zidane is jobless why don’t we get him then?,Chelsea,Yes,jahc4bu,t1_jahbzqp
Youngest team in the competition so shouldn't be a surprise,Chelsea,Yes,jaikjsm,t1_jahcdqh
"Conte did a 43 point improvement from the season before.

We really should be aiming for 75 points plus next year.",Chelsea,Yes,jaifkhi,t1_jai38pp
I'm ambivalent on Potter tbh. I've accepted Todd probably not sacking him anytime soon.  I'm talking about the wisdom of new owners coming in and changing so much so fast. That's the conversation I'm trying to have. If you wanna just vent on Potter go do that with someone else.,Chelsea,Yes,jahuyx0,t1_jahtdt5
Did really well to set up the corner that ultimately killed us versus Dortmund. Excellent cross into the box and no one could the necessary power on it!,Chelsea,Yes,jak86so,t1_jak1nnf
"No way, man. Mudryk has been a complete ghost since Liverpool. Just check his stats – he has 0.22 xG+xAG in his 5 PL appearances.

And he's probably been our worst player since Liverpool. That's not to say he's a bad player – he has potential for days – I just think he's *really* struggled so far.",Chelsea,Yes,jakbqqn,t1_jajvk4s
"I agree. The way these guys perform on the pitch, I feel it is quite apparent that they dont like him or dont want to play for him",Chelsea,Yes,jaghv1u,t1_jaghfyq
"No, because Kante like to roam rather than sit.",Chelsea,Yes,jai0mxv,t1_jahzxyp
I agree. Ziyech shouldn’t be playing either,Chelsea,Yes,jahq86d,t1_jahpxi1
"We all understood your point, just a smart ass not knowing when to shut up lmao",Chelsea,Yes,jaqh947,t1_jalpugm
Ye makes sense,Chelsea,Yes,jagsqny,t1_jagonsh
"Toney posted a statement and mentioned something like 6 months, we will see what happens 

Weird tho as he did around 263 bets",Chelsea,Yes,jajnrwt,t1_jagonsh
Nah I think the players are safe from any scapegoating until Potter is either gone or gets a few good results.,Chelsea,Yes,jaidqdg,t1_jaid83u
"Kompany started at Burnley, is doing well and will get to prove himself in the PL next season before probably going to a bigger club. The notion that someone has to start their career at a top club in order to be considered a top coach is retarded. There are many factors that go into considering someone a top level coach and it’s not just the club they are in charge of",Chelsea,Yes,jai0kw3,t1_jahxcbl
Ugarte over Kone as well?,Chelsea,Yes,jagwoht,t1_jagwjza
Exactly. Soton most likely won’t be in position to ask silly money,Chelsea,Yes,jagxwue,t1_jagx51t
so are we though,Chelsea,Yes,jah3s6j,t1_jagx51t
Ofcourse you don't care how bad Potter has been. Embarrassing.,Chelsea,Yes,jaguim0,t1_jagt5vp
"That’s fair enough, iirc he was one of the favourites when Mourinho came back and when Conte came in, and tbh that’s where my want for him to be our manager came from and it hasn’t really gone away.

If they’re giving all this time to Potter, surely someone with the cv Simeone has would get more than enough time to get it going.",Chelsea,Yes,jai9kuz,t1_jai8rn6
"I wasn’t correcting you or arguing, just wanted to emphasise that Poch would be a good manager for us.

What’s your top 5 then?",Chelsea,Yes,jajdaat,t1_jaj9lwz
"It's not about him, it's about we making every forwards we sign looking bang average.",Chelsea,Yes,jahcm8o,t1_jahaosf
Yeah I think some fortunes will turn if Kante is fit. But let's see. I think the midfield has been the big problem. As United have shown having some quality midfielders can level up the side.,Chelsea,Yes,jaigle0,t1_jaiedys
"Are you going to actually counter any of my points? Or just say the same things over and over? 

It’s that easy right? So, explain Leicester then. They were 17th the season before they won the prem. It’s that easy right? Where are they now? Why haven’t they been consistently top 4? 

Explain why Newcastle isn’t top 4 anymore and look like shit their past few games. Explain why Almiron isn’t scoring goals anymore. Explain why 70 m Isak isn’t ripping the league apart. Explain why Bruno is getting red cards. Explain why ASM is still a selfish, albeit talented, player? Why hasn’t Howe fixed all that? They caught lightning in a bottle and are coming back down to earth.",Chelsea,Yes,jakxmvk,t1_jakx2mh
Ofcourse anything is better than under Potter haha,Chelsea,Yes,jai0psm,t1_jah6hx6
"Because he hasn’t shown any interest in coaching a PL team. 

Ancelotti is expected to leave during the summer because of the Brazil NT job. Who do you think RM will hire?",Chelsea,Yes,jahe1dz,t1_jahc4bu
"they just pass, pass, pass. no attempts to score",Chelsea,Yes,jail324,t1_jaikjsm
>Conte,Chelsea,Yes,jaikoqg,t1_jaifkhi
"Ok, now we're scraping the bottom of the barrel.",Chelsea,Yes,jakc3s6,t1_jak86so
"We will agree to disagree. Cucurella ignored him for basically an entire match. He had multiple chances to get assists and guys just missed or lost control of the ball. Not saying he’s been perfect, but he’s been far better than the stats IMO",Chelsea,Yes,jaki8wb,t1_jakbqqn
So who do you think is the best partner for Enzo?,Chelsea,Yes,jai8wqj,t1_jai0mxv
He's played there before for France well.,Chelsea,Yes,jaicrss,t1_jai0mxv
Sure lol.,Chelsea,Yes,jaqmasm,t1_jaqh947
Shit! The last i heard it was like closer to 200😂,Chelsea,Yes,jajoso5,t1_jajnrwt
"I guess so tbf. Although cucu has gotten the brunt of it so far even when the whole teams shit, poor lad.",Chelsea,Yes,jaig29t,t1_jaidqdg
You're conflating the point you are making with That top club having to be Chelsea. Let them play their way to the top then after 5-7 years at the top we can sign then. Signing half baked managers with no experience at this level is asking for a disaster. Case in point Potter.,Chelsea,Yes,jai2gdo,t1_jai0kw3
"I don’t know much about Ugarte, my knowledge of him starts and ends with Football Manager. I’d go with Lavia or Kone because those are the two guys I’ve actually seen play quite a bit and am familiar with their games.",Chelsea,Yes,jagzkxz,t1_jagwoht
"Was it potter who sacked tuchel and hired himself? Guys in over his head and shouldn't be chelsea manager, but I struggle to blame him for boehlys mistake. If this was a top class manager I could understand, but this guy managed osterand, Swansea and Brighton ffs.",Chelsea,Yes,jagyxcx,t1_jaguim0
"Jose, Conte, Zidane, Pochettino, and outside choice of probably Gallardo, bonus 6th of Bielsa.",Chelsea,Yes,jajfhqz,t1_jajdaat
"That only happened post Hazard. 

Pedro was a good signing and he did well for us. 

Mahrez would have excelled for us as he would have been a major threat on the right meaning Hazard wouldn’t be double teamed",Chelsea,Yes,jahe43g,t1_jahcm8o
Eddie howe took them from bottom of the table to 5th in the space of 1 year you melon. A cup final reached as well. That’s a success for them. He has made Newcastle a competive side despite the lack of quality in the side. We’ve lost more games in our last 3 than Newcastle has all season. Potter has done nearly the opposite. We are uncompetitive in all aspects. Boehly is responsible for such utter mismanagement. What part of that don’t you understand?,Chelsea,Yes,jakxqgu,t1_jakxmvk
">Who do you think RM will hire?

Tuchel, Raul, or Pochettino. There is a little chance Zidane will back to Madrid considering he had disagreement over transfers with Perez during his first and second stint.",Chelsea,Yes,jahmzzw,t1_jahe1dz
Like I said youngest team in the competition. Also the same team took out Portugal so it's not like they're awful.,Chelsea,Yes,jailvti,t1_jail324
I'm going by the assumption that potter is sacked sorry,Chelsea,Yes,jailn9d,t1_jaikoqg
"Ideally someone like Casemiro or Rodri type, physical DM who can sit and also decent passer.",Chelsea,Yes,jaibfwh,t1_jai8wqj
"Yes, but without much success. His best performances with France was when Kante had someone like Matuidi behind him.",Chelsea,Yes,jaie3li,t1_jaicrss

"Right, so you’re just an idiot who can’t counter an argument, and will continue to say the same thing.

"Tuchel is possible but Poch? That would be stupid in RM’s part.

Don’t know enough about Raul to comment.",Chelsea,Yes,jalqgk4,t1_jahmzzw

Anyone available like that?,Chelsea,Yes,jaig1qw,t1_jaibfwh
"Matuidi always played in front of him or was a winger/wide midfielder, I watched pretty much every tournament game France played from 2016 to 2021.

Matuidi was pretty much never a DM for France. Kante would be the deepest lying midfielder along with Pogba in a 2, then matuidi fills in from the left side sometimes to make it a 3 as a box to box wide midfielder(imagine Di Marias role under Carlo ancelotti at real Madrid)",Chelsea,Yes,jaiga6h,t1_jaie3li
Oh ok I thought you are one of these spamn bots.,Chelsea,Yes,jaqo49t,t1_jaqmgzr

When did I say we should be top you absolute weirdo? What argument have u even said? Just waffle out of you. You’ve compared us to Leicester city you’re hopeless not worth a response,Chelsea,Yes,jaky5f6,t1_jakxvie

They have 5 months of decent form that coincides with LFC coping with an obvious squad churn/transition along with injuries and they honestly think that’s that.

"The sad part about EPL in general, is how the competition is so tight, that ref easily could put the thumbs on the scale to decide who to win the tittle

Obviously we pay more attentions to Liverpool. But remember how in 2013/14 Sterling was on side for like 2m for us and was still marked offside? Then last season City got bs pen from Wolves and I think Everton, when literally any drop points could dictate tittle?

When Ole joined United, the press loves him so much that they gave him like 10 penalties in like 20 games or something. Include goals when the ball was out of bound and after final whistle. Thank fk, Klopp publicly comment about it , and suddenly the extra number of penalties disappeared

Our season, we got winds behind our back for the 'Liverpool win tittle after 20 years' narrative too. Ngl, was benefited from decisions which they would have never given us normally.

This year, City still get their share of flavour. But they still get the worst call ever with that Rashford offside one. Meanswhile the only thing Arsenal has to complain about, is they don't get enough penalties. Fk they only won against us thank to Jesus nonpen was given

&#x200B;

Winning from bs decision breeds confidence. And confidence boost players winning more. None of the Arsenal players who win today, will think '*well lucky there that the ref let us score goal at 98th minute'*. They will just start the next match believe more and more that they gonna win the league after such comeback wins",Liverpool,No,jawmreh,t3_11hravp

Like they are good, yes. Winning back from 2 goals down are not the easy feat. But the fact that there is a nudge nudge of the ref too could give them the final cutting edge to win this. 6 minutes of extra time. They scored the winner at 90+8.

"Put a nail in the ""title chances"" they have for good as well",Liverpool,Yes,jaxv52v,t1_jaxuacr
I think they will splash a lot of cash this summer on attackers. Next season they will be a lot more dangerous and a much bigger threat for top 4,Liverpool,Yes,javpypy,t1_javp08c
Yeah arsenal too almost. If we win tomorrow I will put money on Liverpool against arsenal at anfield.,Liverpool,Yes,jawkii5,t1_jawkbi4
My first thought was this,Liverpool,Yes,jawn8w8,t1_jawn2xd
At least the gap to Spurs would remain the same. I was worried of losing to United and Spurs getting further away. Just avoiding defeat tomorrow will take us closer to top 4.,Liverpool,Yes,jawogia,t1_jawn2xd

"It's a bit cringey tbh, every time they win it's apparently luck or the other side being shit. Fact is they've picked up more than enough points at this stage to be in title contention most years, and they've done it with a young squad. Can't really fault them. I'd rather City won of course but it's a bit weird.",Liverpool,Yes,jawqase,t1_jawmcyp
"I'm surprised by it! Given that United in a title race is actually a possibility thought people would be glad they are further away.

We have to get a win tomorrow.",Liverpool,Yes,jawmrn6,t1_jawmcyp
Fuck refs dude.. u can always count on them to fuck things up. What was VAR doing then ? That's what makes that decision a million times worse. If it happened in the non var era I wouldnt have cared much for it as these fucks ups are expected and things level out  over a long season. But the fact that VAR was brought in to catch this type of shit and they stuck their thumbs up their asses then is unforgivable.,Liverpool,Yes,jax05z4,t1_jawybd5
We're not the ones top of the league so I no longer believe City will go on that run.,Liverpool,Yes,jawam5r,t1_jaw9k2p
"I rather City winning. Just to highlight how badly they are buying the league right now

The EPL atm surely doesn't want City to win, so EPL still looks competitive. But we need to highlight how bad these national state football teams are going to ruins football, NOW. Cause in few years time, when Newcastle get into gears, and United get bought by Qatar. The league will still looks competitive. But the level of competitiveness of when everyone uses toy gun, while the oil clubs nuke at each other

When a 16 years old boy in Brazil could costs like 50 mil, just because if they turns out good, Saudi FC gonna buy him for 500 mil. Then we will see lots of smaller, poorer clubs going bankrupt trying to make bets on that deal.

It will be the current EPL inflation on super steroid.",Liverpool,Yes,jawsngn,t1_jawqzpf

"Lol, all those salty Arsenal fans that were calling Brighton evil for not letting Caicedo go and achieve his dream of playing for them instead. I know a contract extensions like this are done in anticipation of eventually selling a player anyway, but maybe *the player himself* signing an extension can put to bed the stupid narrative people tried to weave that the lad's a bloody hostage or something.

Solanke is a good striker. Think the price is justified tbh.,Liverpool,Yes,jawcytl,t1_jaw9w89
With a minimum of a +4GD as well. I had well and truly given up on top 4 a month ago and lambasted my mate who said we could still do it. Now I'm setting myself up for potential heartbreak again which has been a running theme under klopp. So many incredible highs but JUST missing out so many times.,Liverpool,Yes,jaxbgdw,t1_jax5qs3
"They really don't have enough goals in that team, Almiron went through a purple patch and Wilson is always injured.

"There was only a single league game we went 2-0 down that year, away at Watford. In other competitions, there was only the 2-0 fa cup game against chelsea where Adrian gifted them, that 5-0 villa league cup game during the club world cup, and the 2-0 loss to Napoli in the first champions league game. 

Not only did we never come back from 2-0 down that season, but we never scored consolation goals either. Our biggest strength was taking the game for ourselves from the off and doing opponents from taking control.",Liverpool,Yes,jaxalx0,t1_jax3m5f
I miss that feeling of utter dominance ngl,Liverpool,Yes,jax6n77,t1_jax3m5f
"Yep, it’s their story almost every season. It’s like an art for their club but Palace fans are probably thinking it’s infinitely better than fighting relegation every other season or 2 seasons in a row (lol Everton)",Liverpool,Yes,jaxczas,t1_jawvn5b
Well having one of the greatest front three’s of all time wouldn’t be special if you could have it all the time 😂,Liverpool,Yes,jawsow4,t1_jaws6eo

"The number 8 goes to one of the incoming midfielders. The big one from Dortmund surely, if they surprise me and actually make it happen. 

Nunez for the 9? 

One of Gakpo and Jota for the 10? Or maybe it goes to a new Midfielder.

7 could be a Midfield signing. Or Elliott?",Liverpool,Yes,javhzo1,t1_javhan4

"Top 4 make or break is whether or not you can consistently beat lower half teams, and that is done by having a sharp attack rather than a strong defence

yeah they're clearly a shadow of what they've been the last couple of seasons...it's mental that they can drop like this and barely leave the top 2,Liverpool,Yes,javrpb2,t1_javrgx5
"They've won 4 titles in 5 years, they only dropped off once and it took unatural consistency and a big win against them to absolutely knock them out early in the season, City will pip this title imo.

"I assume Bournemouth pulled what Newcastle tried against us, didn't watch it though so can't really comment.

The difference is we show that we could pull like 10 games winning run before. but they yet to",Liverpool,Yes,jaws498,t1_jawr38s
"Tbh Brighton have probably been at their best this season and are still on basically the same points as us, we however have another couple of gears to click into.

I think we only need to worry about Brighton if we ourselves don't improve, and if that's the case then we won't beat Tottenham to the top 4 regardless.",Liverpool,Yes,jawu8j2,t1_jawr38s
"Think that would take an insane run that I'm not convinced they're capable of. Very good team, will most likely get Europe, but top 4? Not something I'm worried about",Liverpool,Yes,jawvf3d,t1_jawr38s
"Newcastle? Bird brain memories in this thread 🐦. There were 3 goals in the 2nd half (before ET), plus a couple VAR checks, and Bournemouth had an ""injury"" delay during stoppage time, I think.",Liverpool,Yes,jawk7dv,t1_jawjnou
Both teams are full of insufferable twats but hounding the ref works. Remember us not even being given a VAR check for the Pickford horror challenge on Van Dijk because our players didn't scream for it.,Liverpool,Yes,jawl46n,t1_jawkne8

That's as much of an excuse as I need to stick Gravel Pit on again.,Liverpool,Yes,jawj528,t1_jawirzr
Timo Werner was thought of as pretty much a done deal months before the window. The official RBL Twitter was basically laughing about how known that was. Extenuating circumstances made it not happen but those links were as hot as it gets.,Liverpool,Yes,jawyfk9,t1_jawwjit
Gareth Barry maybe? That one seemed to go on forever.,Liverpool,Yes,jawy4t5,t1_jawwjit

"Bernardo Silva is top class as much as he is a prick

"KDB too, on his form great pressing",Liverpool,Yes,javz6cw,t1_javwyq1
I think thats why Klopp wants to turn Elliott into Bernardo.,Liverpool,Yes,javxphk,t1_javwyq1
To me its Suarez or Kane in that Firmino role,Liverpool,Yes,jaw70g8,t1_javwyq1
Bajcetic has shown more in 3 months than Jones has shown in his Liverpool career. They’re not the same,Liverpool,Yes,javb07i,t1_jav8kwe
Really do need to make sure we don’t overplay him at such a young age though going forward.,Liverpool,Yes,javb0wz,t1_jav8kwe
Not going to happen. He's already better.,Liverpool,Yes,javcy3m,t1_jav8kwe
">I have to say though, I hope he doesn’t turn out to be like Curtis Jones.

Lets be honest Jones was never that good. His only strength was that he was good on the ball. Baj on the other hand, tackles and has that directness like Gerrard and is composed like Busquets. I just hope next season he doesn't get the basement treatment. Hell I don't even want him to get loaned out.",Liverpool,Yes,jav9tez,t1_jav8kwe
The Bournemouth player laying on the floor for the first minute and a half of added time I’d imagine.,Liverpool,Yes,jawk591,t1_jawjv0r

"They had Usmanov for a long time, washing Putin's money for long enough.",Liverpool,Yes,jawq6li,t1_jawnkvv
The kid is 19. Paul Tomkins has done excellent work on how players improve exponentially upon hitting their 20s. He still has plenty of time to learn the defensive side of the game and become a great CM.,Liverpool,Yes,jav4soj,t1_jav2pqv
"He’s too young to make a prediction, really.

He’s not quite got the pace for the wing, and he’s too much of a liability defensively to play midfield. Hopefully one of those areas improve as he gets older, and he’ll find his place.",Liverpool,Yes,jav4gay,t1_jav2pqv
Great potential but doesn't fit in a 433. Either we change the system in the future to a 4231 or he changes clubs. Same goes with Carvalho.,Liverpool,Yes,javbvhu,t1_jav2pqv
"People here totally have rose colored glasses on for this kid. If he was playing for Wolves I doubt there would be this much hype about him.

He's very one dimensional and relies too much on his left foot so his play is predictable. His passing/crossing and first touch need a lot of work. He lacks pace to play in the wings, lacks the physicality to play in midfield. People say that Xavi and Iniesta were all small but the gulf in technical ability between Elliot and those guys are galaxies apart. 

Unless something changes with his current rate of development, I'm not sure he will be a mainstay in our team by the time he's 23 where his attributes are not enough to mask his deficiencies.",Liverpool,Yes,javajx0,t1_jav2pqv
"Always get downvoted for saying it, but I don't think he fits the side. Not strong or defensive minded enough for midfield (we need midfielders who can snap into tackles etc) and not pacey or explosive or clinical enough to displace one of our forwards. We don't need bodies as depth any more (this may sound like I'm disparaging him but I'm not, he's a clever player but more of a 10), so he would be an obvious one for me to move on for a decent fee and more playing time at a midtable club. Mainly because I don't think the above is something that he just needs to grow into as he's young, it's just a fundamental issue with fit. On the other hand, Bajcetic is equally young but it's much easier to see a path for him into the first team or at least as strong depth for a key position. I just don't think Harvey has the toolkit to be either a mid or a forward in our preferred system, unless we start playing a diamond or something.",Liverpool,Yes,javb12m,t1_jav2pqv
"Honestly, I hope we go big and get proper mids in the summer - there are some really good options out there- Then I think it will matter less, and he can play a more niche role.

As for a winger option, I’d honestly prefer to see Doak get those minutes. It’s really the issue of pace and drive. 

Elliott could have a role but I want to see serious competition for those positions and whomever can push the needle gets the nod. He’s seems a great guy, exudes love for the club but I do have concerns about whether he makes us more elite or not, it doesn’t appear that way to me compared to other options in the market. We need to start dominating the middle of the park again, and I just don’t see it with him, now.",Liverpool,Yes,jav5zxv,t1_jav2pqv
"> but he is very one-footed 

As is Salah. Probably one of the most one-footed wingers I've ever seen. If you're good enough on that foot, it makes very little difference. 

Elliot's future isn't in midfield, it's in attack. He's a serviceable midfielder but he lacks the skillset to thrive there. He is much better running at defenders, dribbling and picking out final passes. 

For a 19-year-old, his understanding of the game is fantastic, and he's great technically, too. I think he's an important player for us in the next few years.",Liverpool,Yes,javecvd,t1_jav2pqv
"I think they are priming him to be our Bernard/David Silva, Foden type. Not especially explosive, but very incisive passing, excellent in half spaces, runs all day and is a natural for making runs in the box. Supreme technique.",Liverpool,Yes,javapc0,t1_jav2pqv
"I don't think there's a nice way of saying it...but if Harvey is a long-term starter I think it'll be indicative of poor recruitment. There will simply be players who can offer all Harvey can creatively whilst being far less limited.

He's still young and he obviously has decent potential, but the moments of magic are few and far between for a player of his attacking predisposition. He just doesn't offer enough on the ball to justify his weaknesses without it imo. 

After seeing Bajcetic in a few sub appearances I was already sure he was gonna make it (same with Doak tbf), I've just never really got that impression about Harvey. Long-term I see his level being more similar to Ox or Shaqiri than the world class player many seem to think he is.",Liverpool,Yes,javd4qy,t1_jav2pqv
"Super potential, and when we we're facing teams parking the bus he offered us something we were lacking by getting into the half space between the Midfield and Attack.

Unfortunately, letting him get forward more requires more solidity from the other two Midfielders and we've lacked that this year making them all look pretty bad. I think if they revamp the Midfield he becomes much more of an option as an attacking 8 again. 
Also after being taken out for a few weeks, he returned against Wolves and looked a lot better in the physical/defensive side of things. Maybe that was just because Wolves aren't amazing, or maybe it's something they've been working on with him recently. 

I'm a big fan and think he'll be a baller. Think it just depends on whether he can adapt enough to make a position in the 433 his own. Think he's be unreal in the 10, or on the right, if the 4231 was reintroduced.",Liverpool,Yes,javld6t,t1_jav2pqv
"The lad deserves a belter song, bit weird how some lads never end up getting one - always felt that Sturridge deserved a proper chant too.",Liverpool,Yes,jav4wur,t1_jav2pl2
[removed],Liverpool,Yes,jav86x5,t1_jav2pl2
I'd be surprised if they'd be willing to spend 120-150 million on a midfielder when their midfield is already world class. Even if it is united. If they decide to keep sabitzer their midfield would be sorted going into next season. They need a striker more than anything.,Liverpool,Yes,javi8cn,t1_javhk8c
"Rent a crowd, they pay people to go to the match and they still don't make noise 😂",Liverpool,Yes,javrgx0,t1_javqrbr

it‘s ridiculous, yeah.",Liverpool,Yes,javrbwn,t1_javqrbr
They’re expanding it though because they need more empty seats to show what a big club they are,Liverpool,Yes,javr51g,t1_javqrbr
Way too early to say imo. Our next run of games are insane,Liverpool,Yes,jawj1gi,t1_jawiu9m
"Helped them already at the start of the season when Gabriel had a clear arm ball, and Saka was offside for their goal but there “was no camera angle present” for the review. That was a huge momentum booster for them and a massive deflator for us",Liverpool,Yes,jawnqh3,t1_jawn6yf
Like most 'I want to save us from those at the top of the hierarchy' sentiments - They just wanted to replace those at the top with a noble angle on it.,Liverpool,Yes,javoddu,t1_javnmy2
"Yeah no such thing as this ""saving football"" bollocks. The plain simple truth is, every fan of their own club just wanted their own team to win. Simples. No need for people to get all philosophical about it.",Liverpool,Yes,javpg0j,t1_javnmy2

"Honestly Mane might have scored more goals but so often he did confusing things that made you scratch your head. 

Mane had this strange ability to spend 40 minutes doing things that made you say ""wtf Is his decision making this game"" and then bang a goal in that's world class just to give you whiplash. 

I absolutely loved him for that in a way it made him entertaining, and despite the confusion you never really were scared because you knew a goal would come from Mane, Salah or firmino at some point. 


Firmino though was just so god damn consistent. There was two or three seasons where I think he just didn't have a single game where he was off the boil. I can't remember him having a single bad game whilst he was in his prime. The level of consistency he brought whilst simultaneously being able to do silky plays is jaw dropping. It may not have grabbed attention like incredible goals do, but in its own way its as important and as beautiful",Liverpool,Yes,jav5f0h,t1_jav4sqi

"Curtis Jones is a good player, he's better than 99.9% of the World's population, but as a midfielder for a team that wants to win big trophies, he's not good enough. I can see him doing well for a good championship team, and maybe at a mid-table level. 

He had one good goal scored against Everton, and he's living off that. Great players are consistent, he's not.",Liverpool,Yes,javgyc4,t1_javef9x
Because they haven't seen Curtis play for a while and have forgotten how bad he is.,Liverpool,Yes,javf7wm,t1_javef9x
Call me delusional but I don't see why Elliott can't become a player like Gavi. He just needs to work on his defensive contributions more. That Wolves game showed that he can indeed put in some tackles and he already has that pressing intensity.,Liverpool,Yes,javerfa,t1_javef9x
"Unfortunately I don't think Curtis is good enough for us, hes a good player and a nice lad. But at Liverpool we should demand the best. He would be better off at a smaller club.",Liverpool,Yes,javet9c,t1_javef9x
"Jones just never kicked on unfortunately.

Imo Elliott has suffered playing time wise with the Midfield being so poor. Him as an 8 always struck me as moving towards a more attacking midfield. Unfortunately that only works when the two next to him are playing well defensively.

I think him being dropped for more defensive minded options in Midfield led to reactionary fans thinking it was too do with his form and not the necessity of the team to be more defensively solid.",Liverpool,Yes,javj1ax,t1_javef9x
"If it weren't for the HG slots I think both should probably move on tbh. Don't think either are good enough for us long term. Curtis is definitely nowhere near the standard.

Can't see United finishing above City in the league. Also a Bournemouth win puts Everton deeper in the red zone. I'm fine with this.,Liverpool,Yes,jaw7vjj,t1_jaw72iv
Of course we do,Liverpool,Yes,jaw7xtt,t1_jaw72iv
"I am Pro Drama, but I also don't want United in the picture. I'm desperate for a win tomorrow as well, I hope the players feel the same way",Liverpool,Yes,jaw7g1p,t1_jaw72iv
They are 11 points behind now certainly don’t want them getting any closer,Liverpool,Yes,jaw7sgv,t1_jaw72iv
Declan to Liverpool pleaseeeee,Liverpool,Yes,jawg1x4,t1_jawflm2
It’s so packed they need to expand it to 61000,Liverpool,Yes,javt5g4,t1_javt265
"With the way he treats his body, and the fact I think his incredibly adaptable. I can see him being very good for half a decade more at least.

Could be wrong ofc, but even at 35 I have a feeling Mo is going to be quite good still.",Liverpool,Yes,javfo34,t1_jave5lc
"The thing is Mo relies heavily on his pace and that will inevitably decrease as he gets older (he’s already clearly gotten slower) Messi, Lewa and Ronaldo never relied on their pace hence why they were able to stay at a high level well into their 30’s. Ronaldo did rely on his pace to an extent but his brilliant shooting and the ability to be amazing in the air allowed him to become more of a poacher. Mo doesn’t have particularly great shooting technique and isn’t great in the air so I doubt he can become a poacher either",Liverpool,Yes,javhhy4,t1_jave5lc
"I actually think Spurs have gone under the radar as our biggest rivals for top 4

Newcastle have a thin squad that could never score goals; a tough defence sets you up well for the games vs top half teams, but scoring goals is how you beat bottom half teams and that's how you get top 4",Liverpool,Yes,javolay,t1_javmsrn
Looking at Brighton’s fixtures you’re absolutely right,Liverpool,Yes,jawitqi,t1_jawi1zb
"It changes week to week to be honest. Brighton are having a solid season, we certainly can't ignore them.

At least with Spurs though, we still have a result in our hands that can potentially put us ahead of them.",Liverpool,Yes,jawiltc,t1_jawi1zb
Imagine worrying about other teams. We just need to play good fucking football.,Liverpool,Yes,jawi9k5,t1_jawi1zb
Why do we want Leicester to lose,Liverpool,Yes,jawy5rs,t1_jawwkni
Soton getting relegated would benefit us more as there are some salvageable players there. Leicester on the other hand..,Liverpool,Yes,jawz3ce,t1_jawwkni
And two golden boot winners ☺️,Liverpool,Yes,jauy8sj,t1_jauxdmg
Plenty of time for them to turn it around…unfortunately,Liverpool,Yes,jawel81,t1_jawdugr
Might be expensive to sack.,Liverpool,Yes,jawvsh8,t1_jawvg0m
Probably cost them a lot to sack him and they've been struggling financially recently,Liverpool,Yes,jawwlco,t1_jawvg0m
"Every time I think they’re about to pull the trigger, they scrape a win the next game.  Irony of the situation is if they somehow manage to get relegated, I’d rate it at .0001% chance Brendan would stick around to manage a Championship side.",Liverpool,Yes,jawxyxj,t1_jawvg0m
Yeah Europa league is better than no Europe but avoid that Conference league shite at all costs,Liverpool,Yes,jaw2len,t1_javzm8x
*scripted,Liverpool,Yes,jawjsuv,t1_jawjlo4
"That's not how it works. It's minimum 6 and then Stephens sat around on the ground for around a minute, which was added back on to the end as it should be.",Liverpool,Yes,jawk6mk,t1_jawjubf
Adam Smith was down injured for a bit I think,Liverpool,Yes,jawk9xp,t1_jawjubf
Nah could never back the cheats. Anyone but the Mancs.,Liverpool,Yes,jawlcqv,t1_jawl54r
"Annoys me how well run they are, you just know when Caicedo goes in the summer they’ll have someone lined up for peanuts who will slot straight in and be class",Liverpool,Yes,jawig2h,t1_jawhq07
He's basically finished at this point,Liverpool,Yes,jaww1ix,t1_jawvrno
Bobby and Jota weren't,Liverpool,Yes,jaxb9ec,t1_jax8ajm
"pre Gakpo yes. Now no, we are stacked in attack rn",Liverpool,Yes,jaz6kaq,t1_jaz5yib
We do need a salah backup. With firmino gone I can see a 15m deal,Liverpool,Yes,jaz7nzw,t1_jaz5yib
"Depends if we lose any other forwards tbh, right now it might be hard to give him enough first team football",Liverpool,Yes,jb07ne5,t1_jaz5yib
"Nah, just coincidence. Don't need that announcement for Anfield to be rocking against the mancs",Liverpool,Yes,javobnf,t1_javddvk
"""We cheat when we want, we cheat when we want....""",Liverpool,Yes,javx7tv,t1_javvc3j
100%. Hes already moulded to fit our system but he was almost twice as exp as Gakpo.,Liverpool,Yes,jaw3cm6,t1_jaw2kud
"Maybe, we'll have to see how Nkunku transitions into the PL. Same goes for Gakpo as well, it's too early to be judging this transfer.",Liverpool,Yes,jaw2t8z,t1_jaw2kud
so is the plan for darwin to play as winger/center when needed? seems odd,Liverpool,Yes,jaw38ay,t1_jaw2kud
April is going to be a rough ride man.,Liverpool,Yes,jayn9pn,t1_jay0ehn
Then i'm small time asf because god damn i'd love to be scoring a 98th minute 3-2 winner at Anfield to keep clear of City in the title race rn,Liverpool,Yes,jawuw3h,t1_jawqym9
Foden is quite a bit faster than Elliott with his sprint speed and decision making.,Liverpool,Yes,javqnzp,t1_javq7dd
"It's very weird saying he doesn't fit into the City team when you look at the stats but it's true. They are a worst team for the reasons you mentioned. That's not to say his positioning and finishing ability isn't incredible because it is, but Carragher made a point on Sky a month or two ago saying we aren't seeing the best Haaland.

Shame City are one of the few clubs who could afford his wages and were willing to pay.",Liverpool,Yes,javset5,t1_javrmou
"How we getting the ball to him with zero creative midfielders bar Thiago ? 
Nunez creates his own goals",Liverpool,Yes,javsd1p,t1_javrmou
"Who?

Edit: ah Palace are playing, fuck that guy",Liverpool,Yes,jaw89d0,t1_jaw80ea
Don’t forget that he’s blue shite,Liverpool,Yes,jawoy9s,t1_jawodzr
"Their manager

Their diving players

Their moaning and whining players

The fact that Partey starts every week for them

Their annoying fans

There's far more things to dislike about Arsenal than just their manager lol",Liverpool,Yes,jawpv4m,t1_jawodzr
It’s the constant whining that’s annoying while watching them.,Liverpool,Yes,jawp3x8,t1_jawodzr
How will man city win save football?,Liverpool,Yes,javgtcc,t1_javg8rw
It's Teta's Gunners who will save football 🙏,Liverpool,Yes,javh853,t1_javg8rw
"He needs 6 goals in 12 games, he'll probably break it but he won't score the 50 goals that people were projecting him to score after his first two months in the league",Liverpool,Yes,javvdae,t1_javv5rz
"There are rumours that he's fallen out of favour with Pep, and will be leaving in the summer.
Of course we hear all sorts of things, and his agent is probably just playing mind games, but Haaland is already on stupid money, so idk",Liverpool,Yes,javwgoa,t1_javv5rz
That attempt was tragic,Liverpool,Yes,jaw9dg7,t1_jaw8z1b
They don't want to sell this summer. They've been very clear about it and they tend to follow their word on when they'll let a player go.,Liverpool,Yes,jawgoqh,t1_jawgdae
Can’t want a team with that twat Partey in it to win,Liverpool,Yes,jawfyq2,t1_jawenv1
Still plenty of season to go. If arsenal are this nervy against Bournemouth at home then there's a lot more twists and turns awaiting them for sure.,Liverpool,Yes,jawfvew,t1_jawenv1
"Arsenal still have City to play at the Etihad and us at Anfield, I still think the race is pretty open!",Liverpool,Yes,jawgapj,t1_jawenv1
Feel they have more of a swagger than balls. Full of confidence in themselves but thats because they havent had a proper humbling since everyone else is ass this season lol,Liverpool,Yes,jawfzbf,t1_jawfs7r
This game should have never been close. I still don't think they win the title.,Liverpool,Yes,jawg3fe,t1_jawfs7r
"Am I getting deja vu? I'm sure I saw this exact comment just down below from the same user.

Edit: I did! It was this one! You deleted it and then posted the same comment lol https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/11hravp/daily_discussion_march_04_2023/jawnitu/",Liverpool,Yes,jaws8gd,t1_jawqsma
"Matip and Henderson. 

I’d keep Gomez because he’s younger, homegrown and Matip has been just as bad",Liverpool,Yes,javhlei,t1_jave4et
Gomez and Henderson stay.,Liverpool,Yes,javj6ry,t1_jave4et
I would choose Gomez and Henderson to go.,Liverpool,Yes,javfhle,t1_jave4et
"Matip for me, about to enter his final year, injury prone, already 31, not homegrown. Get something for him while you still can, and can always look to upgrade on Gomez a season or so later.

Fabinho is the other one, his stamina is just so shocking I can't see him returning to playing every week. Replacing him will also be expensive and he would bring the biggest fee in. Henderson is homegrown and a leader, manage his minutes and let him become the new Milner.(when we first signed him, and he rotated in regularly)",Liverpool,Yes,javjwye,t1_jave4et
"We've played same number of games as Newcastle, no?",Liverpool,Yes,jawl8t9,t1_jawkjim
we have same played as Newcastle,Liverpool,Yes,jawl4w0,t1_jawkjim
"We don’t have any games in hand on Newcastle. We’ve both played 24 games, after we play tomorrow they’ll have a game in hand",Liverpool,Yes,jawl4ew,t1_jawkjim
They also have to play each other.,Liverpool,Yes,jawll9m,t1_jawkjim
"This is bs, there were a lot of times where we got lucky in the 18/19 and 19/20 seasons. Every team needs luck",Liverpool,Yes,jawnu4p,t1_jawnitu
Mate this was literally us lol,Liverpool,Yes,jawo9w9,t1_jawnitu
Haha recency bias at its finest,Liverpool,Yes,jawonxb,t1_jawnitu
try whole season for his high standard. defo starting to decline,Liverpool,Yes,javr6uq,t1_javqopp
he‘s not having a great season tbh,Liverpool,Yes,javrcuo,t1_javqopp
"Think that's just that young section, we could definitely do with something similar to get some life back at Anfield",Liverpool,Yes,jawcjae,t1_jaw9jpn
Mirror lol. Pipe already confirmed these rumours are rubbish and Diaz isn’t going anywhere.,Liverpool,Yes,jauu9lq,t1_jautye4
absolute nonsense,Liverpool,Yes,jauu75n,t1_jautye4
Let’s buy all the left wingers.,Liverpool,Yes,jauvomj,t1_jautye4
"Contracts details aren't public so where ever you got the info, it might not be correct. TAA and Robbo have the same agent so I would assume they have similar contracts.",Liverpool,Yes,javkte3,t1_javjn17
I think it has already been said that those wages are wrong. He signed a new contract in 2021 with improved wages.,Liverpool,Yes,javku2e,t1_javjn17
"robbo came on a 8m price tag , i think his wages are reflected from when he joined , like i remember minamino having low wages too , but kinda surprised robbo didnt get much increase in wages when he signed last contract",Liverpool,Yes,javkavc,t1_javjn17
They draw 1 game and lose at etihad they lose on goal difference,Liverpool,Yes,jawjzn4,t1_jawjrn1
Our inevitability was way stronger in 17/18 season but we still lost sadly,Liverpool,Yes,jawjwif,t1_jawjrn1
Tbf the prematch thread is up.,Liverpool,Yes,jax95rz,t1_jax08u0
"But remember, it's Liverpool who lives in everyone else's heads rent free.",Liverpool,Yes,jax19e7,t1_jax08u0
"> He posted a gif of an Arthur cartoon a few hours before we got Arthur on loan ok big deal.

I mean, it kinda is? How would you guess Arthur Melo?",Liverpool,Yes,javildz,t1_javhg7d
"If we finish 5th, we don’t go to CL if City wins it.

If you’re out of top four, you can only go to CL if you win CL or EL, not other teams.",Liverpool,Yes,jawse1m,t1_jawqzu7
"id  take europa, dont want them winning the CL",Liverpool,Yes,jawrujm,t1_jawqzu7
Yeah haha....consistently coming back to win games is a bad thing and shows their shit mentality,Liverpool,Yes,jawnccp,t1_jawmeem
"According to my Fifa expertise, with the right chemistry style, yes, he's a great replacement! 😂",Liverpool,Yes,jawf555,t1_jawava3
he plays left wing,Liverpool,Yes,jawaziv,t1_jawava3
"No enjoying things ever, only misery",Liverpool,Yes,jawfupd,t1_jawfmph
"One is a LW, something we have loads of

One is an injury prone midfielder, something we also have loads of",Liverpool,Yes,jav5wfz,t1_jav51ww
"Ah yes Rafael Leao would definitely be willing to come and be a 5th Choice attacker + hes a LW that wouldnt fit our RW spot, and bring in Maddison to play where exactly? Last time I checked he doesn't fit the RW and CF spot here at all.

We need like 4 New Midfielders this Summer, and AT LEAST 1 New CB. Pau Torres isn't realistic seeing as Villareal wouldn't want to sell, and he would cost a lot.",Liverpool,Yes,jav5yb9,t1_jav51ww
"Honey it’s 4pm, time for another LW",Liverpool,Yes,jav6pan,t1_jav51ww
It’s so obvious you’ve never watched Leao play,Liverpool,Yes,jav680i,t1_jav51ww
I know you’re not insinuating what I think you are lol,Liverpool,Yes,jawmr60,t1_jawlxl3
Our reserve team needs a left winger?,Liverpool,Yes,jawp9eh,t1_jawlxl3
"If we win tomorrow I'm quietly confident of top 4. Newcastle haven't won a league game since Mid-January and then lads, it's Tottenham. If we can't finish top 4 then we really don't deserve it.",Liverpool,Yes,javvytc,t1_javvp3t
"I'd actually rather play ECL than EL if we had the choice.

Know it's a meme but mixes it up a bit",Liverpool,Yes,javxxnr,t1_javvp3t
Great keeping is what it was,Liverpool,Yes,jaw6d9y,t1_jaw5qo1
It’s pretty much been all spurs not really done much,Liverpool,Yes,jawc5u2,t1_jawafg4
Lots of rumours we are getting him,Liverpool,Yes,jawbl0f,t1_jawbaz9
"No, it's hilarious watching watching him fail again.",Liverpool,Yes,jay2j6n,t1_jaxz93t
"Sacked, back to everton so he can be with them when they finally  get relegated.  Dyche to West Ham to get them a 15-16th place finish.",Liverpool,Yes,jaynf90,t1_jaxz93t
Can't stand the constant talk of the f-ing quadruple for them.,Liverpool,Yes,jayddf2,t1_jaxv52v
"We kickstarted their season by letting them beat us at Old Trafford, now it's our turn to bring a stop to that nonsense.",Liverpool,Yes,jaz0kdg,t1_jaxv52v
They already spent 100m combine in Isak and Gordon,Liverpool,Yes,javrcbr,t1_javpypy
Don't really care about the Arsenal bit. Them losing doesn't give us anything,Liverpool,Yes,jawqo3a,t1_jawkii5
"Agreed, it was the same when they played against United, dominated the second half. Bit rich to call it luck when we did it countless times in our 97 and 99 point seasons.",Liverpool,Yes,jawpytr,t1_jawjor3
"Still another 12 games for them to go, including going away to City and away to us.

A lot of Football for them to still play.",Liverpool,Yes,jawkrfj,t1_jawjor3
Bournemouth at fault mate. Laid on the floor for the first 2 mins of added time.,Liverpool,Yes,jawkhz9,t1_jawk00n
"""They have been training with me dos, tres, cuatro times""

David William Moyes",Liverpool,Yes,javkx7y,t1_javkq3c
Getting into the top four is vital and City isn't really a major rival. I will support them unreservedly.,Liverpool,Yes,javkt1a,t1_javkkj7
"It's envy, Arsenal are getting all the luck we perceive ourselves of lacking in previous seasons. 

Ironically other teams probably thought of us in a similar light before",Liverpool,Yes,jawnhsv,t1_jawmrn6
This is such a weird reaction. We desperately need midfielders in the summer – with one being a defensive midfielder. Why are you happy that one of the top defensive midfielder targets is now off the market? That just means more competition for the remaining targets.,Liverpool,Yes,javbtnd,t1_javak8a
The contract has no release clause according to Brighton tier 1 journo,Liverpool,Yes,jav957o,t1_jav5etd
At least we have won it all recently. Would be tragic to be this close and not get any trophies the past few years,Liverpool,Yes,jaxepnc,t1_jaxbgdw
but we know we've been shit,Liverpool,Yes,javzz57,t1_javxt64
"Once Rashford or Casemiro dip in form/get injured it's over for them, they've been genuinely amazing for them so far. I see Arsenal as more of a team effort, injuries can't break them, if Saka is out of form even Nelson can score",Liverpool,Yes,jawl2b0,t1_jawkq3r
"You'd hurt yourself. Last I checked, robots are made of metal.",Liverpool,Yes,javwa0u,t1_javw5vc
I'm sure Jude will want the iconic 8,Liverpool,Yes,javhw9f,t1_javhplq
"We have way too many nice guys in the team now, we need more Robertsons in the starting 11",Liverpool,Yes,jawpm3u,t1_jawl46n
"Not just handballs... even random shots that should be a goal kick they were complaining that it should be a corner

Even complain about throw ins to Bournemouth , free kicks, everything

Arteta must know it works as he keeps leading the protests literally every single time",Liverpool,Yes,jawphyx,t1_jawlkta
[deleted],Liverpool,Yes,javz28c,t1_javxf1y
Is orange,Liverpool,No,jawc03y,t1_jawbt34
"So they don't have a proper RB, much less an attacking one. Ouch.",Liverpool,No,jawc8u3,t1_jawbt34
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin) I think I'll join you digitally,Liverpool,Yes,jawmb8q,t1_jawj528
Fekir had the Liverpool kit on at one point and still didn't happen,Liverpool,Yes,jax0b9f,t1_jawyfk9
What changed the course of Werner’s transfer to LFC? I think he could have been better with us than he was at Chelsea but still really glad that one didn’t work out.,Liverpool,Yes,jaxcrt6,t1_jawyfk9
"Himself, Mane and Salah would have been a big fuckin problem, imagine that press",Liverpool,Yes,javxmgk,t1_javxd5h
"Completely subjective, other fans hate Robbo because he winds people up",Liverpool,Yes,javy13e,t1_javxrfb
Never heard of him honestly,Liverpool,Yes,javxtza,t1_javxnlm
That's not happening imo,Liverpool,Yes,javxut0,t1_javxphk
One of Jones' biggest strengths was that he was scouse. We so wanted a Gerrard 2.0 we tried to will it into becoming reality. Had that screamer against everton and is okay but is clear he is not 'generational'. A squad player at best.,Liverpool,Yes,javc6f9,t1_jav9tez
"Was he down for a minute and a half ? Felt like less 
Fair enough so",Liverpool,Yes,jawl0ju,t1_jawk591
"Yeah, to justify a long-term place in a side which wants to push for trophies you really need to be top class to justify such a key role in the team.

At the bare minimum I reckon he'd need to become on par with a player like (LFC) Coutinho and i'm just not seeing it. And as somebody else has mentioned even when Coutinho left it was a net benefit to the side.

If we let Elliott's potential enter our minds when it comes to long-term first XI planning then it'll be to our own detriment.",Liverpool,Yes,jaw0rf8,t1_javajx0
When we had a genuine world class player in that role of attacking 8 playmaker cutting in on their strong foot (Coutinho) and we still got better when we sold him partially from gaining more defensive solidity in the midfield. Let alone a half decent but nothing incredible young prospect who can't run. He just doesn't work in our set up and he isn't good enough to justify working the team around for him.,Liverpool,Yes,javppuy,t1_javb12m
"This is exactly how I feel, you just worded it much better",Liverpool,Yes,javaiu1,t1_jav5zxv
"Why are you comparing harvey to salah,

In midfield you can't be as one footed as harvey is, he really needs to work on that, you can't get around it unless you are messi or salah, completely different posisitons to playing as a number 8 in midfield anyway.

Unless you are messi or salah yeah, but why are you using these players as a yard stick?

It doesnt matter as much playing as a winger sure, but in midfield you can't be as one footed as harvey.",Liverpool,Yes,javiqzn,t1_javecvd
"He's still too one-footed and lacks the physicality to be a top attacker, in our system our forwards need to be lethal and Harvey just ain't it. Can people honestly say that they'd be happy for Elliott to be Salah's successor in the first XI?

Even when it comes to fellow youngsters, the eyeball test between him and a player like Doak is night and day in that position.",Liverpool,Yes,javyyz5,t1_javecvd
I think so too....I just don't think Elliott is of the level required to become world class there and we can't afford to settle for anything less in the current PL climate.,Liverpool,Yes,jaw085o,t1_javapc0
"All of those guys are in a different league in terms of technique and skill even at the same age. Elliott isn't even as skillful as someone like shaqiri who was never more than a backup for us.  This is not even mentioning the complete absence of pace and physicality (those you mentioned are much quicker and stronger also), and he has no right foot at all.

He has good vision and decision making but he's just not someone who is ever going to be a key player for a team challenging for titles.",Liverpool,Yes,javp6hh,t1_javapc0
I fucking love belting that out man. Its so awful its just brilliant.,Liverpool,Yes,javcjir,t1_jav86x5
They have one world class midfielder in the twilight of his career.,Liverpool,Yes,javn1z8,t1_javi8cn
"Casemiro has 1 or 2 seasons before the inevitable DM drop off, Fred is 29 and has been elevated by Casemiro, Bruno turns 29 this year and hasn't been consistent since the covid season 

Eriksen looks like he's truly on the wane at 31, and no one has any idea how Sabitzer would look in their team. That then leaves Scooby Doo McTominay and the ghost of van de beek 

Not only would I not say a Casemiro-Fred-Bruno midfield is world class (they're 3rd), they've definitely bought for ""now"" in mind, probably to ease Ten hag in, and this will be their ceiling, like us in 2019. They definitely will be on the lookout for fresh blood if they want to get competitive for the trophies that matter",Liverpool,Yes,javksa7,t1_javi8cn
"The issue is, if they want to, they can spend £120m.",Liverpool,Yes,javim7q,t1_javi8cn
"city ""fans"" being paid actors is my favourite stupid conspiracy theory that i'm totally willing to believe in",Liverpool,Yes,javrsne,t1_javrgx0
The sound of my thumb hitting the screen is generating more sound than that stadium,Liverpool,Yes,javrq85,t1_javrgx0
"Expand stadium.

Accounts with links to owner buy the available tickets.

Ticket holder doesn't attend game as they are in Abu Dhabi.

Receive clean money to spend.",Liverpool,Yes,javrogf,t1_javr51g
it‘s just for pumping more money into the club as revenue. they‘ll just buy all the extra tickets every game.,Liverpool,Yes,javrj1b,t1_javr51g
"Like imagine if we can sack ref every time they fk us over. 

But yeah that the sort of things referee have to face now. Fk other clubs and that fk Webb will come out to defend you. Fk Arsenal over, and they have to publicly apologise, and even referee may face the sack",Liverpool,Yes,jawo7me,t1_jawngck
"Yeah. That's a valid reason for punishment. How many refs were punished for the Pickford murder attempt? Oh, zwro? Hm. Guess Liverpool's players didn't nag enough at the ref.",Liverpool,Yes,jawokz6,t1_jawngck
It was said when we went through a rough patch during January. The scapegoating against Elliott was massive back then,Liverpool,Yes,javezot,t1_javeuc7
Barca are in trouble again in the summer they need to sell,Liverpool,Yes,jaw02kr,t1_javzndt
*[Laughs at Arsenal]*,Liverpool,Yes,jawdt76,t1_jawdn6u
"burn has been solid at left back, they have not conceded many this season, he's solid at the back",Liverpool,Yes,javr5e2,t1_javq1ov
"might be, i have to agree.",Liverpool,Yes,javpoza,t1_javpnga
"Fuck that, real club every time",Liverpool,Yes,jaw96vr,t1_jaw8sx6
"I'm agreeing with this. City winning is like ""meh"".  I respect Arsenal as a club, but on the other hand I can take joy in seeing their fans missing out on a title.",Liverpool,Yes,jawb5w8,t1_jaw8sx6
"With a game in hand, a win turns it into 8 points, which has been caught up from this position",Liverpool,Yes,jaw7xv3,t1_jaw7sgv
"Yeah i don't see him losing his legs overnight like many others, he takes too good a care of himself.

Even when he does, he'll still be a very good striker.",Liverpool,Yes,javhfxq,t1_javfo34
">I actually think Spurs have gone under the radar as our biggest rivals for top 4

Spurs have an easier fixture list looking at theirs compared to ours, that's our problem the way I look at it.

Means we have to beat them at Anfield.",Liverpool,Yes,javpvy8,t1_javolay
"Probably not a we thing, more of a me thing.  Plus a high score line would put them (Soton) above Everton which is more what I was referring to.",Liverpool,Yes,jax0kpb,t1_jawy5rs
If we want one team to go down is West Ham to snatch Rice or something.,Liverpool,Yes,jaxfm2u,t1_jawz3ce
"Leicester's owners make most of their money from Duty Free shopping, mainly in Bangkok. Covid absolutley ruined tourism. And even though Thailand re-opened pretty early, most of their consumers had been Chinese tourists. China only started letting people travel for pleasure in January. So for 3 years they had very little revenue, hence the lack of spending and no money to tell B Rodge to F Off. Which IIFC would be 15-20 million.",Liverpool,Yes,jay1whq,t1_jawvsh8
"I’m backing us for top 4 and to beat them. 
We never win at etihad so I think that will be a draw . I fancy us with jota and Bobby vs Arsenal they always score. 
I see city beating Arsenal there so they lose by one point or two 
They have the Toon away too
Not backing anyone just know the tiny margins and see it costing them",Liverpool,Yes,jawll68,t1_jawlcqv
Isn’t he like 38 or something?,Liverpool,Yes,jaww8js,t1_jaww1ix
He's probably going to be an inside forward like Mane was.,Liverpool,Yes,jaw3qut,t1_jaw38ay
That's not my point. The nonsense comments about them being lucky etc.... I love nothing more than a late winner!,Liverpool,Yes,jaxbnau,t1_jawuw3h
His technical abilities are amazing.,Liverpool,Yes,javqwz6,t1_javqnzp
He's also deceptively strong. He looks like a twig but uses his body extremely well.,Liverpool,Yes,javwewn,t1_javqnzp
"I love Nunez, but he does not create his goals. All his goals have come from assists, nothing wrong with that. But he is not that kind of player.",Liverpool,Yes,javsxj3,t1_javsd1p
That and the 'injury' team talk at 65 mins each and every fucking game.,Liverpool,Yes,jawpxsg,t1_jawp3x8
"It's a joke about all the times basically every neutral wanted City to win instead of us.

Oil state cheating > ""unbearable Scousers"" doing it fairly, apparently.

So yeah I don't really care but see the logic in Oil state cheating > Lego man fairly.",Liverpool,Yes,javj42a,t1_javgtcc
"He most likely will ofc, but he's not been at a 0.5 goals per game ratio since the new year",Liverpool,Yes,javvrad,t1_javvdae
"Well such a stance only strengthens their negotiating hand, i'd be very surprised if they don't entertain negotiations if a club wants to break the £100m barrier and Gvardiol asks to leave.",Liverpool,Yes,jawh2t4,t1_jawgoqh
Yeah we could do with a singing section. No drums though; for me they just make the atmosphere seem forced and unnatural.,Liverpool,Yes,jaz03b6,t1_jawcjae
"The Mirror aren't even the direct source, they say that it's something ""CalcioMercato"" are saying.",Liverpool,Yes,jauyibl,t1_jauu9lq
I think he can be a long term replacement of Salah. I love Jota but maybe he can be part of a swap deal.,Liverpool,Yes,jav5cbi,t1_jauvomj
"My guy was working in Primark or something 10yrs ago, maybe his idea of a good wage is more relative?",Liverpool,Yes,javl07g,t1_javkavc
yeah we are guessing Douglas Luiz at that time. Arthur's loan was a huge surprise,Liverpool,Yes,javjg8h,t1_javildz
[deleted],Liverpool,Yes,jawtxi3,t1_jawse1m
"true, we got like 200 left wingers now haha",Liverpool,Yes,jawb268,t1_jawaziv
"Are you enjoying it now?

Will this game even matter to you if we don't beat United tomorrow? Arsenal schadenfreude is such a lame cope",Liverpool,Yes,jawg68j,t1_jawfupd
We signed 3 LW and only one plays LW. Jota and Gakpo both for CF roles,Liverpool,Yes,javl3t0,t1_jav6pan
"He's a midfielder. We are losing at least 3 this summer. Need bodies, they can't all be Jude Bellingham",Liverpool,Yes,jawoxfi,t1_jawmr60
"Both, to be fair. You still have to finish that.",Liverpool,Yes,jaw6gh5,t1_jaw6d9y
Yeah it kind of feels with them getting him they are expecting him to go but it’s Chelsea and that would be giving them too much credit,Liverpool,Yes,jawbyxf,t1_jawbl0f
"Is he our plan to fix that RM spot? He's a tad more competitive physically than Elliott, but a long way from what we need there.",Liverpool,Yes,jawcky2,t1_jawbl0f
Rookie numbers,Liverpool,Yes,javrf6z,t1_javrcbr
"I'm not happy he's offf the market he would be have been a good buy. What I'm sick of hearing is every podcast or transfer thread repeatedly mentioning him (along with others we all know). It's just repetitive and tiresome. Sure if we REALLY wanted him and he wanted to come here he wouldn't have signed contract. 

So let's just move on",Liverpool,Yes,javc28j,t1_javbtnd
We have a trophy for THIS YEAR already. The disrespect for the vaunted community shield  🛡 😤,Liverpool,Yes,jaxklhe,t1_jaxepnc
"I am not complaining. Been by far the most successful period of my lifetime and for me personally I wouldn't want to be state owned and financially doping our way to trophies.

Just merely stating that coming so close as much as we have is heartbreaking. The slip in 13/14 was the hardest to take because that season was the most fun I've had as a fan and it was such a cruel way to lose it.",Liverpool,Yes,jaxq1ke,t1_jaxepnc
"Agreed, but also feel like this is Arsenal's only chance this season. They're not making easy work of it and we know those effort levels aren't sustainable. I think they'll have a big drop off next season like we had in 2014-15",Liverpool,Yes,jawmhud,t1_jawl2b0
"IIRC the reason he likes the number 22 so much is because it shows his ability to ‘do it all’ so he likes it because it shows his ability to play as a 4,8 or 10",Liverpool,Yes,javj544,t1_javhw9f
That court case is going to take years. I very much doubt that.,Liverpool,Yes,javzemu,t1_javz28c
They don't really use traditional full backs in their system. It's by design. Both of their full backs play inverted.,Liverpool,Yes,jawcdzt,t1_jawc8u3
"That was during a window, though. Werner was outside a window, from a winter, heading into a summer.",Liverpool,Yes,jax77et,t1_jax0b9f
It’s totally understandable why it didn’t his agent was trying to change things at the last second,Liverpool,Yes,jax2xyb,t1_jax0b9f
"It was said it was Covid. He had a release clause and we were not ready to pay it in one shot because of the economic uncertainty. We then bought Jota, where we could pay Wolves in installments.",Liverpool,Yes,jaxhs8w,t1_jaxcrt6
Chelsea gave him like 250k/300k in wages,Liverpool,Yes,jaxxckf,t1_jaxcrt6
Nah they're very different. Silva is a proper cunt,Liverpool,Yes,javyme7,t1_javy13e
"Plays with Lorient in Ligue 1, kind of a break out season for him so he's not that well known.",Liverpool,Yes,javyux8,t1_javxtza
Too soon to tell tbh. Elliott is still just 19.,Liverpool,Yes,javy5kt,t1_javxut0
Nobody has ever thought he would be in any way shape or form Gerrard 2.0…..,Liverpool,Yes,javeo4t,t1_javc6f9
A 22 year old kid shouldn't be a squad player though. He should be loaned out to get as much minutes as he can.,Liverpool,Yes,javcrzk,t1_javc6f9
Almost exactly,Liverpool,Yes,jawl2gz,t1_jawl0ju
"Absolutely agree - and Coutinho brought goals too at his best. I wouldn't say Elliot 'can't run' tbh, but I don't see him as a particularly amazing passer (whereas Coutinho had a wicked eye for a pass even at 20) and isn't someone who'll change a game like Coutinho could at all.",Liverpool,Yes,javqn1z,t1_javppuy
"I'm comparing them because, *as my comment literally says*, Elliot's future isn't in midfield. He's being used there as a stopgap.",Liverpool,Yes,javk7nf,t1_javiqzn
"It's way too early to write anyone off at 19. Gerrard, famously, was told he was too physically inadequate at a young age and spent time developing to ensure he was the right bulk for the PL. 

Elliot has a *long* time to improve all weak areas of his game. Seeing nonsense like this just highlights to me how people here expect young players breaking through like Mbappe & Foden are the rule rather than the exception.",Liverpool,Yes,javzidd,t1_javyyz5
"I didn't know that it was a theory, but I'm also fully on board with it",Liverpool,Yes,javs31r,t1_javrsne
"Haha but in all seriousness, nobody is talking about how City are clearly inflating attendance figures to boost revenues with years",Liverpool,Yes,javrxsn,t1_javrq85
"No it wasn’t, stop talking bollocks…",Liverpool,Yes,javf465,t1_javezot
His 1 v 1 defending is extremely poor. Obviously he has other strengths but if you run at him he's a joke.,Liverpool,Yes,javtkrs,t1_javr5e2
"That’s exactly it, because its a real club it would suck more for me. I don’t want anyone other than Liverpool to be successful. I can brush off City winning it. Either way any club other than Liverpool sucks. A pick your poison thing",Liverpool,Yes,jawbymk,t1_jaw96vr
"So, would you prefer ManU win or ManCity? Cause ManU is a ""real"" club, I suppose?",Liverpool,Yes,jawehch,t1_jaw96vr
Hell yeah,Liverpool,Yes,jawc015,t1_jawb5w8
"yeah, our next 5 are unbelievably tough. Will decide a lot.",Liverpool,Yes,javrmvz,t1_javpvy8
I realise it was probably to do with Everton now,Liverpool,Yes,jax6y3f,t1_jax0kpb
Arsenal are going to drop more points than that. They have a tough schedule. Fulham away is next.,Liverpool,Yes,jawmcw2,t1_jawll68
36,Liverpool,Yes,jawwhk3,t1_jaww8js
36,Liverpool,Yes,jawwgl6,t1_jaww8js
"True, but Nunez is a completly different player so i have no idea why they compare the two. Against wolves he was playing left back, winger, cdm and attacker. Haaland can be completly invisible if hes not fed balls by his teammates.",Liverpool,Yes,javu8pr,t1_javsxj3
Haaland at City doesn't create his own either he's a poacher for them basically.,Liverpool,Yes,javzkqk,t1_javsxj3
Do you see haaland doing the run Nunez made vs wolves where he chipped it past a player and exploded with pace down the line?,Liverpool,Yes,javvylk,t1_javsxj3
They huddle every 10 mins like an nfl team,Liverpool,Yes,jawte1z,t1_jawpxsg
Which is Italian Mirror basically 😂,Liverpool,Yes,jauyot4,t1_jauyibl
Pretty good match to be fair thanks for asking. Liverpool being shite doesn't mean I can't slag other teams. What retarded mental gymnastics is this,Liverpool,Yes,jawgtqj,t1_jawg68j
"Not as easy as it looked, Bournemouth players ain't exactly Firmino level",Liverpool,Yes,jaw6vbm,t1_jaw6gh5
"Don't really have an opinion here, but just putting it out there that a lot of South American prospects if they're about to move to Europe, they sign a new contract to make sure their old club's getting something decent out of it.",Liverpool,Yes,javjl51,t1_javc28j
"yeah ill never get over 13/14 with stevie's chance to go out with the title.

i do feel a little grumpy about city's financial doping keeping us from an even more incredible period and have to wonder if one or two signings would have made the difference for us, but it would be MUCH worse without having won the lot along the way",Liverpool,Yes,jaxx3sv,t1_jaxq1ke
He's a good footballer but doesn't have the same aggressive tenacity to be able to play centre mid in the way Silva does,Liverpool,Yes,javyf0q,t1_javy5kt
How new are you to football?,Liverpool,Yes,javemss,t1_javcrzk
"Fine, but only the best players ever can be so one footed, so my comment is still valid.

Harvey will not be salah, messi, robben tier winger, lets be honest.",Liverpool,Yes,javko81,t1_javk7nf
"Your above statement could be used to invalidate any doubts shown towards any youngster ""what do you mean David N'Gog isn't gonna be the next Torres? Nonsense, he's only 19!""

If it's okay to hype up youngsters then it should also be okay to be critical, such is the way on a football discussion forum.",Liverpool,Yes,jaw2j67,t1_javzidd
"Yep, i've never met a City fan IRL, I'm convinced they're fictional.

I live near Leeds, Leeds fans and Man United fans and Liverpool fans are fucking everywhere....even the odd Chelsea or Arsenal fan but City fans? Not one.",Liverpool,Yes,javsb0t,t1_javs31r
What bollocks? Even Salah was shit on during that period,Liverpool,Yes,javfrvn,t1_javf465
He does get a lot of undeserved criticism,Liverpool,Yes,javgao1,t1_javf465
"It was. Haven't seen anyone say sell him specifically but definitely seem a lot say he has no future at the club. 

Mostly after being shoehorned into LW. It's crazy considering he's 19 and already a solid player in the squad.",Liverpool,Yes,javiago,t1_javf465
Fuck you,Liverpool,Yes,jawnlgc,t1_jawehch
"April 1st to April 9th is City away, Chelsea away and Arsenal at home then we still have another 4 PL games to play in April alone.",Liverpool,Yes,javtdmt,t1_javrmvz
"Watch his goals at Dortmund, explosive goals, with him sprinting with the ball. City’s style of play has really hindered his explosiveness, but he’s still scored 25+ goals.",Liverpool,Yes,javwhoz,t1_javvylk
What are we slagging them off for again?,Liverpool,Yes,jawjnok,t1_jawgtqj
"To be honest, pre Klopp I would have bit your hand off for an fa cup win and a top 4 finish. They wouldn't have even had to have been in the same season.

For basically my whole life we have been a cup team (we won the league when I was 1). I don't think a worse team will ever win the champions league than the 05 team. If you did a combined 11 with 2019 winning squad it's basically just the 19 squad. Gerrard gets in, possibly Carragher. I think people would argue for Alonso but he wasn't the player he went on to become later in his career.",Liverpool,Yes,jay06zp,t1_jaxx3sv
"Jesus fucking christ man, theres always this one guy trying to be a smartass and provoke other people. Imagine thinking theres anything wrong with saying a 22 yr old should be getting as much game time as possible.",Liverpool,Yes,javf6yc,t1_javemss
"He's also nowhere near as good as any of our forwards, so the guy's point is moot in that he'll never be 'an important player in our attack'. Wouldn't get a sniff ahead of Diaz or even Gakpo.",Liverpool,Yes,javvsj5,t1_javko81
"Yeah, as a forward he really doesn't seem to be anywhere near that band but it's taboo to say so...people will just say ""he's young"" ad infinitum.",Liverpool,Yes,javymej,t1_javko81
"Your argument embodies just how intensely football fans scrutinise young players. Here you are, desperate to point out that Elliot won't be good enough for Liverpool in the future, despite him being a teenager with his best footballing years well ahead of him. No wonder young English talents become disillusioned so easily; they've only got to glimpse at social media to see thousands of middle-aged adults slinging their dismissive opinions around every single hour.

No one can definitively say how Elliot will turn out but, for a 19-year-old playing out of position in a team distinctly lacking confidence, I think he's doing a fantastic job.",Liverpool,Yes,jaww2bh,t1_jaw2j67
I have to admit there are a few City fans who are aged in their 50s in my local town in the south east of Ireland. I'm convinced that they are just contrarians who had to support the opposite team to their brother or uncle or whatever,Liverpool,Yes,javsums,t1_javsb0t
"Show me a single comment let alone many of people actually suggest Elliot being sold.

People were rightly criticising because in midfield he’s not great, but certainly improving.

I’ve been here and not seen that typed even once, maybe at best you see a rogue idiot but to suggest it was “many fans” is bollocks.",Liverpool,Yes,javg55n,t1_javfrvn
"He gets a lot of deserved criticism too but come on mate did you see fans clamouring for him to be sold?lol

The lads talking waffle",Liverpool,Yes,javgclx,t1_javgao1
"BVB have good technical midfielders though 
We’re more built on running and pressing. 
Trent is our most creative player",Liverpool,Yes,javwpuh,t1_javwhoz
Teams in the Bundesliga set up very different defensively compared to most of the  Prem teams when we play against them,Liverpool,Yes,javzhf8,t1_javwhoz
You're right mate Arsenal gonna walk the league every year from now till the end of time. I'll make sure to not enjoy football matches again sorry about that,Liverpool,Yes,jawmlcx,t1_jawjnok
"yeah prime gini was not as iconic but he wouldn't be easy to displace from the team. i love alonso though so its hard for me to pick. same for me though. We were the best in the world at times recently and probably one of the best teams ever. As much as I hate barely missing out on more, I'm not taking that for granted.",Liverpool,Yes,jazntud,t1_jay06zp
And you think it's healthier in the long-term to overhype youngsters from a young age? It's at the point where suggesting he isn't the next Iniesta or David Silva is met with defensiveness. Do people not realise just how few players can reach those levels? No wonder English talents become disillusioned so easily when they feel they aren't fulfilling those ridiculously high expectations.,Liverpool,Yes,jawz6gu,t1_jaww2bh
No you see alot of it especially people saying he’s got no future at the club but it’s mainly just people being reactionary,Liverpool,Yes,javglwk,t1_javgclx
"Exactly, players like Trent + Robbo would be great for Haaland, imagine those two feeding him the ball + working alongside Nunez. That team would be destruction.",Liverpool,Yes,javwwkq,t1_javwpuh
I'm just asking a question...,Liverpool,Yes,jawmoca,t1_jawmlcx
"So, in your mind, it's better to write them off and doubt their ability instead? How odd. I've never said Elliot could be the next Salah in our team, I've simply said his future lies in the attack and his one-footedness won't hinder his performances because other players have shown that you don't need to use both feet equally to be amongst the best. I'm not saying he's the next Messi, but I am saying he looks far better when used in an attacking way rather than in midfield (where, actually, he's still showing his ability & desire even though it's not his natural position and he's working within a very dysfunctional midfield).",Liverpool,Yes,jaxbf0n,t1_jawz6gu
Then I can only assume it’s a time zone thingy I luckily avoid as I’ve never seen anyone suggest him sold,Liverpool,Yes,javgtbe,t1_javglwk
"It would be the same with Nunez though we’d still be very weak to transition and he doesn’t press well .
He’s terrible press actually",Liverpool,Yes,javx5pm,t1_javwwkq
Asking a facetious question you know the answer to already,Liverpool,Yes,jawnbvl,t1_jawmoca
"He's better in attacking roles for sure, but to justify a starting place in those roles long-term...you need to be of such a high level that its difficult to see Elliott reaching it given his physical limitations. 

I think his best position is probably similar to Coutinho's role at LFC, but it'd be optimistic to think Elliott can reach that level and then force us into a tactical shift to accommodate him. 

Think it's best to control expectations, if he becomes a world class player then great, but we should not plan for it and not allow it to effect recruitment",Liverpool,Yes,jaxf3ij,t1_jaxbf0n
Where is your joy? You seem so miserable from these last few comments 😅,Liverpool,Yes,jawno6r,t1_jawnbvl
"I have grown up to the ripe old age of 31 and watched Liverpool my entire life, for the most part that was alongside my old man who passed away two years ago last week.

After all his years of watching them - many, many before I was even born - he always used to crack on to me about how Firmino was up there with the best he's watched (although wished he'd stopped getting his teeth done!)

It feels like the end of an era in more ways than one. I absolutely fucking love Bobby. With every player that leaves we move one step closer to a squad full of lads who my dad never got to see pull on the jersey and that makes me feel extremely empty.

Anyway, I know he'll get the send off he deserves. Hope he gets whatever he wants from his next move, gave me many years of joy and some incredible memories.",Liverpool,No,jasqae6,t3_11gszr9
Press conference day again. Holy hell where did this week go,Liverpool,No,jaq3wvj,t3_11gszr9
"I'm hoping for a shift to 4-2-3-1 next season. Nunez and Jota as strikers with a bit of space to roam. Gakpo in behind. Salah on the right, Diaz on the left. Elliott, Carvalho and Doak players that can sub on.

It would take some of the pressure off of having to get new midfielders too. We've got Bajcetic, Fabinho, Henderson and Thiago for the positions behind them. I wouldn't want to rely on those offcourse, so 2 in would be required I'd guess. Maybe one out too. Then next summer shift someone again for a new player.

Can still shift to a 4-3-3 if we get the right players in for midfield. Injection of pace and technical ability por favor. On top of doing the dirty work offcourse.",Liverpool,No,jarp02w,t3_11gszr9
Did not expect to see Caicedo signing a new contract at Brighton but good for them keeping a young talent they helped develop.,Liverpool,No,jasbava,t3_11gszr9
Dortmund is flying. I hope they win the league,Liverpool,No,jasr735,t3_11gszr9
United fans are cocky as fuck man. I haven't missed this.,Liverpool,No,jasyess,t3_11gszr9
"Kone ugarte Jude 

Could this be good midfield for us. Saw someone posted on Twitter this rebuild only takes  200mil or so.

All of them under wins lot of duels, very physical and bit of flair in Kone and Jude with ball carrying ability.
Ugarte is like deep playmaker.",Liverpool,No,jaqqmlf,t3_11gszr9
I love Bajcetic. I love Nunez. The whole reason why the season is still enjoyable for me is watching them play.,Liverpool,No,jaqg2ra,t3_11gszr9
"I'm never gonna forget Bobby's 18/19 performance against Arsenal and particularly, his second goal. The way he danced through them so effortlessly whilst the defenders around him were falling over and making clowns of themselves. 

Such a shame that he's leaving.",Liverpool,No,jar3076,t3_11gszr9
"barca yesterday showed what to do against this real team. sit deep and use your chances.  
yes, we‘re 2-5 down, yes it doesn‘t look good at all. but i‘m delusional when it comes to our chances. and if there‘s one team in world football that can overcome the odds, it‘s us.  
anyway, full focus on sunday. a win would be a massive statement. let‘s fucking do this.",Liverpool,No,jaqnsoh,t3_11gszr9

"Fuck me, why are some United supporters convincing themselves the greenwood case is complicated. Brain dead scum honestly.

He's a rapist, manipulating cunt who broke bail to make contact with the victim resulting in police losing a key witness. If he wasn't a fucking idiot id accuse of him of plotting the pregnancy as a way to garner sympathy and get him off without punishment.

If I was a united supporter I'd rather see him dead than wearing the shirt again.",Liverpool,No,jaqqyg9,t3_11gszr9
I hope the team can learn something from RM - Barca match and device a plan,Liverpool,No,jaqjkoj,t3_11gszr9
Think I’m gonna be in tears when that last si senor rings out final match.,Liverpool,No,jaruq2j,t3_11gszr9
Im gutted…ive only been a supporter for the last 10 or so years so relatively new but Bobby’s was the first kit I was able to buy back in 2017-18. Doesnt feel real that he wont be a part of this club after this season 😭,Liverpool,No,jas9orz,t3_11gszr9
"Bobby leaving is heavy heart stuff, and is definitely the most sad outgoing player for me since Coutinho at the time.",Liverpool,No,jau7cu8,t3_11gszr9
"Good goal from Emre Can the man. Turned on to watch Bellingham but Lipzeig has been dominant throughout and unlucky to be 2-0 down. Not much of Bellingham in this game, but Garvidol looks dominant on the ball.",Liverpool,No,jasr0kd,t3_11gszr9
"According to Plettenberg, Bobby won’t join another premier league club because of his love for Liverpool, this goodbye is gonna be really heartbreaking 😭",Liverpool,No,jatqy25,t3_11gszr9
i‘m sad that bobby is going to leave but i suppose it‘s the best for both parties. he‘s a legend for our club anyway. i hope he can stay healthy wherever he goes.,Liverpool,No,jar2nbt,t3_11gszr9
Seeing these legends leave the last couple of years and being a bit emotional just makes me dread the day Klopp leaves even more. Not ready for it at all,Liverpool,No,jas6jm7,t3_11gszr9
For a club that is run so well. Having potentially 4 players leave on a free is insane. This is like Arsenal a few years ago whereby each season big players left for free instead of capturing good fees for them,Liverpool,No,jarbw3x,t3_11gszr9
"Firmino one last game vs arsenal?

"Watching Inside Anfield and that scene with Bobby in the tunnel just watching on, before coming on, is heart wrenching.",Liverpool,No,jasiubz,t3_11gszr9
"Really upset about Bobby. One of my favorite lfc players in the klopp era. Couldn't believe the news when I heard he was leaving but, everything comes to an end. I am gonna miss Bobby. Will always be remembered as a red.",Liverpool,No,jat2vbo,t3_11gszr9
Ferdinand saying Bellingham should join United because it would be better for his future lmfao. Man is a complete clown,Liverpool,No,jau0g82,t3_11gszr9
"Curious to see what team we start against United especially in the midfield.

My guess is it’ll be Bajcetic-Fabinho-Henderson. 
Definitely praying Henderson isn’t fatigued.",Liverpool,No,jau5rfm,t3_11gszr9
"after next season we should be getting roughly 500k per week wages off the books, frees up the wage bill for incomings!",Liverpool,No,jau9d4a,t3_11gszr9
"As long as its not Real Madrid, i would assume we can win on our day.",Liverpool,No,jaqj5ak,t3_11gszr9
I am happy with a boring draw against United on sunday. We need to keep momentum and defence wise keep stable. I like us to sit back and counter them as they did at OT. We need to become hard to beat and just get this point on the board. 14 games to go we need to fight and Anfield need to wake the fuck up and sing all game!,Liverpool,No,jaqlhst,t3_11gszr9
Hearing Si Senor for the last time when Bobby’s on the pitch is going to hurt me to the core. I’m not ready for it,Liverpool,No,jaqykgi,t3_11gszr9
Firmino deserves a proper sendoff by winning the UCL and getting top 4,Liverpool,No,jarwpc6,t3_11gszr9
Kill united before you leave Bobby,Liverpool,No,jarjjpe,t3_11gszr9
"Just rewatched the highlights from that wolves game. 

At the time I was a bit annoyed at Tierney but now after watching it again I'm four times as annoyed. That Fabinho yellow was even more ridiculous than I remembered it, and it's so blatantly obvious jota got pushed now being able to watch it again. 

But what pisses me off more is how blatantly commenters and broadcasters try and hide dumb decisions. Like initially when fabinho gets tackled they're talking about how it's dangerous play from the wolves player, and then the moment they realise its actually Fab getting booked they just transition to ""oh it's a difficult call"" when moments before they where acting like it was a clear foul on Fab. 

Then the jota goal the commenter deliberately don't comment on the push on jota and in fact none of the replays even really show it during the game, but it's clear as day on the highlights later. 

It just feels as though Tierney clearly is biased against liverpool. I don't think the broadcasters are particularly biased against liverpool but at the same time they're so desperate to defend referees at the moment that they end up defending clearly wrong decisions, either genuine mistakes or bias. 

Like we get it refs get a lot of stick and a fair bit of it is undeserved. But by defending referees when they blatantly fuck up you make it impossible to defend referees when they're getting unwarranted stick. Because people just assume the commenter once again defending shit refs and ignore them.",Liverpool,No,jasui48,t3_11gszr9
It really probably is the best time for Bobby to go injuries are a constant problem for him now and just doesn’t look the player he once was,Liverpool,No,jaqtgq0,t3_11gszr9
"With as sad as the Firmino news is it really streamlines our attack now.

Striker - Nunez & Jota

Right Wing - Salah

"Something from the Jurgen Presser not seen anyone comment on but it was alluded to on this week’s Analysing Anfield - Klopp said, “they’ve obviously built  this team not for the next 20 years but for now”.

Think what he’s referring to is Casemiro specifically - he came in as a panic buy, overpaid for after they lost their first two league games. He’s obviously slotted in superbly for them and has filled in the gap at CDM they were crying out for for years.

However, given his age, you expect that in a couple of years, when the Ten Hag project will peak and they will be expected to be challenging on all fronts, Casemiro will be in decline and they’ll have to find a replacement.

I don't have a great amount of confidence he'll be back to his best on a timeframe that works for us. Gomez seems to have just fully collapsed, I do not trust seeing him on the team sheet in any match of note now.

I ask because I think there's one player I really, really like, although he'll be incredibly expensive. Not Gvardiol (though he'd be PHENOMENAL to add to the squad), but Kim from Napoli. He is astoundingly good, a very complete defender, I think he'd really add to our side.

"Klopp has to get this game tactically right and not give acres of space for the likes of Rashford to exploit by playing a high line. 

We have to dig in and play on the counter attack like we did against Man city to get the win. Too many casual fans seem to think Ten Haag is some tactical genius and Klopp is a novice when it comes to tactics. We have to surprise them and make use of Nunez's pace on the wings, this is where we can take advantage of their weakness. AWB isn't a great defender 1 vs 1 and if you give Nunez some space to get his touch right, he can leave him behind eating dust, same for Rashford vs Trent. 

Klopp has to get the team selection spot on. I wouldn't be opposed to bringing Bobby back for this game and instructing him to sit on Casemiro like he has done against Rodri before. 

If not Bobby I would start Gakpo and tell him to do the same. Start Bajcetic and fabinho in midfield and bring Henderson back in the lineup instead of Elliot, the game can be won on the wings instead of midfield.

We can give a drubbing and shut their fans up for good. I am hoping for a 3-1 convincing win. Up the Reds.",Liverpool,No,jaqs2e9,t3_11gszr9

With the Bobby news that's likely Ox, Keita, Bobby and Milner all leaving for no money this summer alone. Add in the likes of Origi, Can, Gini, Lallana, Moreno, and Sturridge over the past few years, and that's a lot of money we've missed out on.

"Thoughts on Gakpo taking up a midfield position once Diaz is back fit? 

If we’re going to persist with an attacker like Elliott in midfield, even though it’s obvious he’s not as effective there, why not slot Gakpo into that position with Nunez up top and Diaz left? (Obviously dependent on form, though if he gets anywhere near his pre-injury form then he walks into the team). 

Gakpo is showing promise as a false 9 in the last few games, and he’s becoming really good at holding the ball up and progressing it either through his passing or through holding and carrying the ball forward. 

At the very least I think he’d be a better option than Harvey…who I’m not knocking btw, he’s obviously brilliant but I feel he’s being wasted in that midfield position. I’d rather have him as a backup to Mo.

All of them except Sturridge are either playing week in week out for a PL team or a top 5 European league team that are in european competitions.

There's only one person winning the Balon D'or this season and he could be injured for the whole season from now.,Liverpool,Yes,jaqgyci,t1_jaqdhzl
Depends what they class as a ‘candidate’. He’s been the best player in the world since the World Cup and has the 4th most G+A in Europe. If United do the treble or quadruple he’ll definitely get top 5. We all know Messi’s already won it but if Rashford keeps up this form he’ll get top 10 at least,Liverpool,Yes,jaqdo5w,t1_jaqdhzl
He’ll be in the top 30 and maybe crack the top 10 but that’s about it. He’s good but he’s not there yet.,Liverpool,Yes,jaqfw4a,t1_jaqdhzl
"Honestly it hits me so hard but it may be for the best even though it hurts. 

I still think Bobby has a year or two left in him but at the same time if he is declining I'd still remember Bobby as the utter dazzler he was, than have those memories ruined a little bit by a shadow of himself playing for us well past his best. 

Bobby will go down as one of my favourite lfc players of all time. I think to many he will be a player they remember most fondly.",Liverpool,Yes,jat1e9m,t1_jasynt6
"Can see Milner extending another year with a further wage cut.

Its about £25m annual cost with the wages of those that are leaving though which is big.",Liverpool,Yes,jar4d9s,t1_jar2i1g

"Why do you think so? I feel we can shut down Rashford cause of Konate being back and helping Trent on his side. 

Casemiro scares me we shouldn't let him control the tempo of the game, hoping Klopp can find a way to keep him quiet.",Liverpool,Yes,jasrezy,t1_jasq6u8
Harvey needs to be more cube shaped,Liverpool,Yes,jaq91vf,t1_jaq5pq8
"Shaqiris left foot was an absolute wand. He was probably the cleanest striker of the ball in our squad at the time.

Elliot doesn't really have that left foot wand. He just doesn't seem to be able to strike the ball with that power.",Liverpool,Yes,jaqcoln,t1_jaq5pq8
"Not to be harsh on Harvey, but they also have a lack of speed in common",Liverpool,Yes,jaqcfc2,t1_jaq5pq8
"Hes left foot  lack of precision, Shaq is sturdy he can take some powerfull shots, harvey is no where near if we compare him to Big Shaq.",Liverpool,Yes,jaq96fq,t1_jaq5pq8
"I actually think he reminds me more of someone like Lallana. Technically good, but not great, not very big, not that fast; but trying to compensate with high work rate and clever positioning.",Liverpool,Yes,jaqapsk,t1_jaq5pq8
"You're being downvoted for no reason, i don't get this place sometimes. You're just trying to start a conversation. God damn.",Liverpool,Yes,jaq8uk8,t1_jaq5pq8
"He's physically like Shaq in that they're both short, stout and not that quick

But technically I think they're pretty different other than the fact they're similar positionally",Liverpool,Yes,jaqhle1,t1_jaq5pq8
"Looking more and more likely now. Makes sense now when Pep Ljinders was rumoured to call him the ""missing link"".",Liverpool,Yes,jasn66u,t1_jaskqrw
partially i think so. A little more versatile since he can be used on the wings also,Liverpool,Yes,jasnks3,t1_jaskqrw
If he was then it's terrible management because he plays nothing like Bobby,Liverpool,Yes,jasld98,t1_jaskqrw
In that he will play in the front three yes. I have yet to see another number 9 ever that plays like Bobby and trying to find one is a fools errand. Better to just adjust our play style to a place where we don't need it as much and move on.,Liverpool,Yes,jaslx8g,t1_jaskqrw
"Thinking so, and I think Carvalho will get better and better and be a good option as he develops.

"There's so many draws for so many teams that an unlikely run is bound to happen at some point, there's about a 1/500 chance of it happening so not even that unlikely in the scheme of things. You can't be serious that you want an investigation?",Liverpool,Yes,jaqjm45,t1_jaqdakb
"I remember we had a lot of home draws in the EfL and FA cups runs in 2011/12, don't know if it was as many as 9 in a row",Liverpool,Yes,jaqfs74,t1_jaqdakb

Dunno the numbers but Leeds have a stupid % of away draws in FA Cup last few years.,Liverpool,Yes,jaqti2u,t1_jaqdakb
He'll get a UCL club. Unlike Ronny he still has something to offer.,Liverpool,Yes,jarcl9p,t1_jaqx7uu
I think Konate on Trent's side will be a massive help as compared to someone like Gomez playing as a cb. I remember Konate doing well to keep Vinicus Jr quiet in the cl final.,Liverpool,Yes,jas5rln,t1_jas0avn
"Nope. Barca don’t rely on their fullbacks for creativity so Xavi can do that, Trent is basically our only creative output so he has to stay on",Liverpool,Yes,jas1gtb,t1_jas0avn
Then you kill our creativity he still caused them plenty of problems anyway so it didn’t really work,Liverpool,Yes,jas0dru,t1_jas0avn
Gomez would still get rinsed by him if he was fit to play,Liverpool,Yes,jas0t0j,t1_jas0avn
That means he isn't going anywhere now.  Not at least till season after next.,Liverpool,Yes,jasssju,t1_jaskrqy

"Can see Bobby setting up a goal for jota and Nunez in this scenario and then scoring the third one himself for a good measure.

God I am gonna miss the guy. What a legend. Never complained about anything and always smiled. Sad to see such role models go.",Liverpool,Yes,jat1f38,t1_jasyn9x
"matip fair enough but it would be dumb to get rid of gomez barring a big offer. he just signed a new deal and is young, homegrown, and can play centrally or as a fullback. he doesn't need to start 40 games a year to be considered worth keeping around.",Liverpool,Yes,jathvdt,t1_jatefp4
"It depends on funds. If we don't have enough id rather invest all in midfield (if thats even possible is another story) if we have more funds, we should get another CB also.

Gomez is just too unpredictable, don't know which Gomez will turn up so he's not someone we should be seeing on our defense anymore at least as a CB. I would be open to sell him or would want him on a loan to have consecutive games to develop his consistency. He isn't going to get that developed here as a CB unless we are willing to have him collapse multiple times during a season.

Kim is a good alternative and i am a little biased since i'm Korean lol. He has a 15 day buyout clause that opens on July 1st. So thats something clubs might target. He refused to delete that clause right now so i guess he is testing waters also",Liverpool,Yes,jatlk94,t1_jatefp4
"Seems like the plan is to bring in a young CB not sure if thats at the expense of Matip or not though.

Inacio, Silva and Gvardiol are the names that have been chucked about all young ball playing CBs.",Liverpool,Yes,jatiikj,t1_jatefp4
"I definitely think we do.

Virg and Ibou I trust a lot at CB, but they're not guaranteed to play the majority of the season together, while Joe and Joel are simply not as reliable as they used to be. We're not quite screaming out for a CB as much as midfielders, but maybe we should be.",Liverpool,Yes,jaul98i,t1_jatefp4
"We have Phillips and Williams too right? Lads could use some time on the pitch. Main issue seems to be players being overworked. So there needs to be healthy rotation. Getting a cb like Gvardiol would be good, but it won't be a priority. If we can find a good Fabinho replacement and couple of good attacking midfields, then suddenly we are a lot stronger defensively as well as offensively.",Liverpool,Yes,jausf2i,t1_jatefp4

">With the Bobby news

What's the news?",Liverpool,Yes,jaqttv8,t1_jaqtmym
"I think he is more likely to move if BVB wins the league, as it would be the perfect time to go. You don't want a situation where they come close and Bellingham feels he wants to stay for another year to give it a real go at winning a big trophy with them, he seems to clearly like them.",Liverpool,Yes,jasnh2y,t1_jasdiyl
"On the flip side, winning the league with Dortmund might help him find peace with leaving the club in the place they're in.",Liverpool,Yes,jasxfr3,t1_jasdiyl
Lol thats sad. Let BVB win Bundesliga if they deserve it,Liverpool,Yes,jaslp5k,t1_jasdiyl
"Or he could see it as the perfect way to bid goodbye to Dortmund and start a new chapter/challenge in his career

Thiago left Bayern in a similar way",Liverpool,Yes,jasmb90,t1_jasdiyl
I think with the emergence of Bajcetic this is a possibility for sure. He often tucks in to form a pivot with Fabinho as mentioned by Klopp and thus this allows more attacking freedom for the 3rd midfielders demonstrated against Wolves with Elliott playing further forward in attacking transitions.,Liverpool,Yes,jar0h3l,t1_jaqs1sw
"I can see us playing a 4231 from next season not this tbh. We have too many players who can play the 10 role in this team. Elliot, Carvalho, Jones, Gakpo and Bobby if he chooses to sign an extension. 

Bellingham is also comfortable in a double pivot as he plays there for BVB. This season Klopp has reverted to his safety first 433 with fixed roles and not much rotation, he won't experiment much I feel other than rotating some players to keep them fresh.",Liverpool,Yes,jaqtloj,t1_jaqs1sw
About as relevant as the ‘articles’ you read.,Liverpool,Yes,jas3hxy,t1_jarhzx0

"Klopp is certainly too loyal at points, I don't think there's anything wrong in pointing it out either.",Liverpool,Yes,jauka9b,t1_jaugoe4
what the fuck are you talking about,Liverpool,Yes,jauhjok,t1_jaugoe4
"Its working fairly well right now though, they can both interchange during games as well.

I kind of feel like  the long term plan is still Darwin through the middle its just right now he's more effective on the left, I remember reading that Klopp put Lewandowski at attacking mid when  he arrived becasue his overall game wasn't good enough so playing there allowed him to learn and improve which I feel like is similar to Darwin.",Liverpool,Yes,jaqzxpd,t1_jaqzb6a
And it yet it somehow works. Nunez has been really good on the wing and likewise with Gakpo central.,Liverpool,Yes,jaqzifm,t1_jaqzb6a
"darwin‘s best position is on the wing and gakpo is the bobby successor.  
it‘s working well and it will continue to do so.  
and it‘s not like our wingers don‘t get central to score (sadio and mo). our cf just needs to drop deep to distribute the ball and that would be a waste on darwin.  
not sure why so many on here are so hung up on this. trust the plan the club has ffs.",Liverpool,Yes,jar2z72,t1_jaqzb6a
"Klopp takes players and develops them as something else all the time.

E.g. Mane as an inverted winger, Bobby as a false 9, Gini from a winger into a CM, Trent was RM at underage level, Elliott from RW to CM. Even bacjetic was originally a CB.",Liverpool,Yes,jarbkhz,t1_jaqzb6a
"We already replaced him with Gakpo and Firmino can only play through the middle where we have 3 players who are all ahead of him.

Paying him to stay as a 6th choice forward when he's in his 30s and starting to decline would be a mistake.",Liverpool,Yes,jarsjx3,t1_jarn6wx
"He's hardly played all season,  it's sad he's leaving but all good things must come to an end.",Liverpool,Yes,jatbatz,t1_jat5tjn

Firmino was like 6th choice we probably don't need a replacement with Carvalho there,Liverpool,Yes,jarxmo1,t1_jarx9ep

"Origi we tried to sell but declined. Sturridge and Clyne were constantly on crutches, gl selling them. Moreno went to a decent club but Villarreal don't even come close to a similar wage-bill as us, even 5 years ago. Can ditto. Wijnaldum we possibly could've sold, but he was still of use to us, so I doubt Klopp actually wanted to.

Ox, Keita, high wages always on crutches. Firmino very good player that we probably could've sold but didn't want to ourselves.

When some of these players are at a high you can sell them to anyone but likely don't want to. When they're on a low it gets a lot harder to sell them seeing the wages they're invariably on when playing for us.",Liverpool,Yes,jaro30u,t1_jargu1f
"All of them....

Wijnaldum - Played just over half the minutes at PSG last season as he did with us, discussed being disillusioned with his move there and has since been moved on.

Origi - 608 minutes in 16 apps this season for Milan (38 per app). Out of 33 possible appearances - not exactly week in week out.

Clyne - 14/13/16 appearances per season since he left. Not week in week out.

Moreno - 18/5/24/12 apps per season. Not week in week out.

I'll give you Lallana as he's on the back end of his career and Emre Can fair enough.

You say they all play week in week out for PL/European teams. In reality they are mostly now all squad players for much smaller teams than Liverpool - and were, almost as soon as they left.

How much do you think we were going to coax out of Milan for an Origi who played just over 300 minutes in the last two seasons with us? A very similar number of minutes for clyne.
These guys simply did not have value. 

The point is they shouldn't have been given the contracts they received in the first place. Ox and Keita both were given long term contracts in the knowledge that we couldn't keep them fit for the duration.",Liverpool,Yes,jasjjcy,t1_jargu1f
"And yet people still show the same sentiment ad infinitum. 

For instance people complained about Hendo's extension whilst they called for Bobby to be extended.

"Yeah, there were some promising signs in the Wolves game though.",Liverpool,Yes,jau7732,t1_jau70th
"There was some mad stat I'm sure I saw someone post in the full time thread. Like Tierney on average gives a penalty every 3 games. He's reffed liverpool 22 games,  so assuming Liverpool got the penalty half the time and the opposition the other half you'd expect him to have given liverpool 3.5 penalties. He's given liverpool zero penalties in his entire career. 

He's just blatantly biased at this point.",Liverpool,Yes,jaswddj,t1_jasvtzu
"I didn’t deny any of that, in fact I said it myself. The issue still remains though, and it will be something they will have to deal with - literally my entire point.

"Lol, Man United fan slithering into the Liverpool sub.

No one’s said you haven’t bought young players, wtf are you talking about.

"It could definitely be an option for next season, however what I’m suggesting is we stick to the 433 as usual, but instead of playing Harvey in cm we pop Gakpo in there…just for the remainder of the season. He’s both more mobile than Harvey (which will help with the press from an advanced midfield position and to provide defensive cover which Harvey lacks in) and more of a goal threat at the same time. It’s a way to get our potentially 4 best attackers on the field at any given moment…because if we stick to trying to be more solid at the back then our attack won’t suffer as much",Liverpool,Yes,jaqv0sx,t1_jaqtloj

">And it yet it somehow works. Nunez has been really good on the wing and likewise with Gakpo central.

Has Gakpo been really good centrally though? 2 goal contributions in 10 games averaging a G/A every 392minutes...

Playing at LW this season he has 30 G/A in 24 games. Averaging a G/A every 65 minutes. 

I get the Dutch league isn't the PL and the PL sample size is obviously smaller but he's played 186 games on the wing and 26 at CF. His output is significantly better on the wing. 

And when we get Diaz back he will go straight out on the Left and Nunez will go centrally, where, imo he's at his best and most dangerous.",Liverpool,Yes,jar7gly,t1_jaqzifm

"If it had been a 1 year deal, it would have been a win win. 

The plan with the other forwards isn't exactly clear either. Darwin is supposed to be a 9, who is playing mostly wide, Gakpo is a winger who is playing mostly 9. Jota is always unfit.

I genuinely wanted Coutinho to leave because I didn't even think he made it to our best 11.

"We were never gonna really get anything for Sturridge but the fact we still had after his last decent season was 5 year prior just sums us up.

All the others went to decent clubs so it just shows they had some value in them. We could of sold Origi and got decent money for him after 18/19 season.

Keita and Ox will end up at decent teams. Ox probs a mid level PL club and Keita will probably go back to a decent German side. So again it shows they had value in them.

I'm not talking about silly money, I just mean we should have got rid of all these players a couple years previous when they all held that bit more value and it frees up wages and spaces in the squad.

Us having 11 midfielders on the books this season has surely hindered us signing in that area in the last 2 windows. Hopefully this is now the start of a change now.",Liverpool,Yes,jarpst5,t1_jaro30u
">How much do you think we were going to coax out of Milan for an Origi who played just over 300 minutes in the last two seasons with us? 

That's exactly my point though, it's about selling them at the right times. Origi 18/19 scored a few HUGE goals for us in the CL and that winner against Newcastle. His game time was limited but he was very effective when we needed him. We should have gone to him after that season and explained the situation and tried getting rid. He had value 100%.

Fair enough the other maybe not starters every week but they obviously had value for other top clubs to take them.

Keita's injury record pre Liverpool was great. And we've only given him 1 contract so don't know where you've got that from tbh. If you are trying to imply that we couldn't have had a taker for Keita in the last few years you are just chatting shite haha. He's been in his 'prime' years the last few years and half our fans still think he's the best thing since sliced bread. The fact he will end up at a top club playing European football shows he has some worth in him.

Ox was always a worry with injuries but even then it's the same, we could have easily shifted him over the last few years. We have a big problem with keeping hold of dead wood. Hopefully this summer will be the end of that",Liverpool,Yes,javs8ij,t1_jasjjcy
">He's just blatantly biased at this point.

Yup in the game against wolves. He made three major decisions against us and I felt they all were wrong lol. I was just feeling lucky he didn't send Fabinho off in the second half after giving him a wrong yellow card in the first.

But if you are suggesting 424 with Nunez, diaz, Gakpo and salah then you need two top high energy midfielders to play that role.

That's the main problem when you're one of the clubs with the highest wage-bills, you can probably shift a lot of your players but do they then want to go?

I agree entirely on your last paragraph though. Keita and Ox moving opens up space on the wage-bill. 

I could see Jones leaving too and Milner retiring. Then maybe one of the players that's a mainstay for now leaving too. Like Fabinho or Thiago. Great players no doubt, but if you can't get them fit enough it becomes a burden.",Liverpool,Yes,jartyw8,t1_jarpst5
"But did anyone actually want Origi sold after that season though? It's an absolute mad argument we can have here to be honest, because you can use his good year that season to say we should have sold then and I can say that season showed what having him in the squad was worth more than the, what, 10m we may have sold him for? You even said it yourself, he was very effective for us. So would it have been worth the fee? Hindsight is of course a wonderful thing.

You can say the obviously had value point about anyone. (And you are being VERY generous by calling Bournemouth, Brighton and Villarreal top clubs). Every footballer on the planet has value, doesn't mean teams are willing to pay money to buy them out of their contract. Put it this way, we could have done with Origi at times this season - but at no point would we consider buying a player like him would we? It's almost a risk free option for teams to take them for free - wages aside of course. 

And with regards Keita, the other half of fans (of whom I presume you are one) believe he is utter shite.

">Both goals coming while be was playing central, after playing most of those games not looking great on the left.

People keep saying this Idk if you are just lying to suit your agenda or you actually don't know but....

Gakpo has played 2 games at LW (1st being his debut) and has played 8 games at ST. 

We haven't seen enough of Gakpo on the left to judge him. So how you can say he's mostly played on the left not looking great. It's just a pure lie.

I actually thought he looked good on the left on his debut. His only other appearance on the LW was 3-0 loss against Wolves where all 11 players looked fucking awful.

">That's the main problem when you're one of the clubs with the highest wage-bills, you can probably shift a lot of your players but do they then want to go?

Bit of a cliche that. You've got clubs coming up from the championship taking players like Lingard on 200k+ a week. 

Origi declined Wolves but did we make it clear to him he had no future here? Going off other players situations I very much doubt it. If we sold him after the 19 season he'd of been 24 years old and had just been pivotal in us winning the CL he'd of had numerous takers if we made that clear to him.

Keita is on 120k a week currently. BVB and Leipzig average salary is 80k per week, But both have several more experienced players well over 120k a week, which Keita would fall in anyway. The fact we were debating giving Keita a new contract as little as 3 months or so ago show this situation has nothing whatsoever to do with no one else offering Keita decent wages.",Liverpool,Yes,javvjom,t1_jartyw8
">But did anyone actually want Origi sold after that season though?

The fact you've asked that show you obviously have this sentimental problem the club have. He had a good impactful end to the season but still played little to no minutes. So why wouldn't we sell him then? He'd of been 24 with 2 years on his contract and had just won the CL with us. We'd of got £20m+ for him defo. 

The season after he started 4 PL games and the season when he left he started 2 and Alisson scored more goals than him. He was never gonna end up getting decent game time so why not sell him when he had value? There's no answer to that.

I didn't mention Bournemouth anywhere? But tbh I'd say any PL club is a top club in the grand scheme of things. And Villarreal won a European cup less than 2 years ago and compete in Europe most years so trying to argue with my point there you really are clutching at straws LOL.

I don't rate Keita at all, you are right. But we've been one of the 2 or 3 best clubs in Europe over the last 5 years. Keita isn't good for us. Doesn't mean he won't go to another club and do well. Like I said previously he will 100% go to another club playing European football in Germany or Spain or something. So what makes you so adamant we wouldn't have been able to shift him at all the last 2-3 years? We are in a world now where Forrest have been promoted and spent 200m+ on about 30 players and giving players like Lingered 200k+ a week. Chelsea have just signed Mudryk who'd previous played 30 career games in the Ukrainian league at 22. And have give him an 8 year contract on 200k+ a week. UTD have spent £100m on Antony who you can see literally has no quality whatsoever. 

Trying to suggest that 2 years ago someone wouldn't have took a punt at a 26 y/o Keita for £25-£30m is just so utterly ridiculous it's beyond me. would of freed up £12m+ in wages as well. Yet we've decided to pay him 120k a week for an extra 2 years for him to give us nothing is just shocking business from the club. It's as simple as that.

">This time we don't know them, we lost to them very early and they got really good a month after that.

Don't we? Watching them against Leicester told me two things clearly, if you intend to play the high line against them either take your chances ( and trust me Leicester wasted like two to four good chances) 

Or don't be clumsy In defense. That Faes guy literally gave the ball away so easily which led to a break and Rashford goal. 

Either way I am more comfortable playing the liverpool way thanks to Konate being back and Nunez/salah being in good form, jota showing his old fighting sport, Gakpo being settled into the squad now (but I still think Klopp will drop the line back maybe not all the way back but possibly a mid block) 

As long as we don't lose the game in the middle I feel we can do well. Hoping we take their game to them, play quick transitions and play counter attack and utilise Nunez pace along with Salah's link up play to cause havoc. 

Also the game being at home and anfield roaring will definitely help us take the game to them. 

I'll take the score draw, you predicted but I have a feeling this will be like the match in the covid season - United team coming in high spirits having been in good form and we needing a win to keep chances of a top four hope alive.

No, what a nonsense thing to say, but I'm not sure why you're so pressed about him playing a different position. He needed time and now he's playing really well through the middle. That's where his good performances have come so why change it?

The whole 'it's working so who cares' argument is also super strange and invalid to a certain degree. We've won 3 of our last 10 games. And although we look like we've hit some kind of decent form in the PL, I wouldn't say we've looked great in them wins personally.

"How can 1 persons opinion make them a walking contradiction? you are clueless. 

I don't rate Keita, but Klopp's given him 13 appearances this season and there was talks about Klopp wanting him to have a new contract. up until very recently most of our fan base had him down as our best midfielder haha. 

Most players that are sold are sold because they are surplus to requirements, if that meant they were worthless to everyone else, most players would be retiring as teenagers lol. Mad I've had to explain that to you 😂

Football is a game of opinions, it's what makes it so good. I don't rate Lisandro Martinez, Seen him play a good few times this season and just honestly don't get the hype around him. Yet to a lot of pundits/ex pros he's the best defender in the league this season.

Just because players haven't worked out with us doesn't mean another manager wouldn't take a punt on them. It's worrying that you can't get your head around that 😂.

And regarding Origi, that's not what I said at all. He barely played that season but his impact in a few games towards the end of the season would have upped his market value and doing it on the CL stage would put him in the window. Rather then letting him rot on the bench for 2 years to go on a free? 

You do understand that football is a business yes? Why would we not sell a player who had no future with us whilst he actually had some value? And trying to make out no one would have took him is also laughable. We got £25m for Brewster who made 3 appearance for us.

He doesn't play these three in the league, also decided to rest Dembele. 

And in the second leg he had no Gavi due to suspension, pedri due to injury, no Dembele and he decided to play Sergi Roberto on the left lol. 

I think he was on a self sabotage mission and just wanted to get out of the competition. In one of his comments he even said that ""it's hard to motivate Lewandowski for the Europa league"" lol who says that before an important tie.

Also they were lucky to face Newcastle at a perfect time, where their form had dipped leading to the game and they had karius as their starting Gk ( no thanks to us)

It'll be a while before Diaz is back to full fitness, and either way Nunez & Gakpo have to compete with Diaz and Jota. For those two positions. It's a good problem to have.

If you remember the preseason before last Ox was playing as a false 9...it was depressing. But maybe Klopp has just been looking for a Bobby alternative/replacement since then and things Gakpo is capable to be the player to do it?

>he didn't develop them players into new positions at all

Mane switching wings wasn't much of a change tbf, but Gini played mostly as a winger/AM for Newcastle, I don't anyone but Klopp was thinking of him as a fairly defensive minded, hard working CM.

"Gini was a central midfielder his entire career before he joined Newcastle, it was actually Newcastle that converted him into an attacking winger role. 

Trent was developed into a RB by Pep Ljinders when he was managing him in the academy. He played loads of positions including CB haha. Same goes for Bajcetic he played CB in the academy but then got developed into a midfielder. You can see from his frame he'd never be a CB. You can't give Klopp credit for that, players play allover at youth level, Carra played as a striker for England at youth level. You can't read too much into these things.

Milner is just a versatile experienced player, Wouldn't class him filling in at full back as Klopp developing him at all tbh.

Mane yes was a predominant right winger but had played a lot of games on the left still. again putting him on the opposite wing isn't re-developing him.

Klopp I'd say is currently attempting to re-develop Elliot as a more disciplined 8 rather than a 10 or a winger. There's a lot of question marks over Elliot in that position atm though. He's took a lot of criticism whilst playing that role.

And yeh he's developed Firmino into one of the best CF in world football for a 3-4 year period. 

I don't wanna sound like I'm slating Klopp, I just don't think what you're claiming is true. I also don't mind the way we play with Gakpo and Nunez either.

We never gave Fabinho a proper deputy, and I don't think TAA and Salah really had any direct backups that were good enough to rotate and fill in when needed (ala Tsimikas for Robertson). 

Salah has been an ironman, but even he needs to have a break every now and then.

TAA, somewhere in the 2nd half, took the game by the scruff of the neck and I couldn’t be happier. He looked a man possessed which is exactly the kind of attitude needed from him. Thought Salah was largely wasteful while Harvey had a couple bright spots he was generally wasteful as well. Such is the standard we have set over the last 5 years. 

If we decide to pass and move, like we did for the 2nd goal, we trounce United at the weekend. I think Gakpo out wide left with Nunez playing through the middle drifting out wide coupled with Salah tucking in is what we need. Overlapping midfielders will require Baj and Harvey to switch sides, giving the FBs a runner and causing overloads in the channels.

"The last time [I tried to defend Harvey Elliot](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1034mut/jones_enough_is_enough_underfire_elliott_cant/j2wrqhe/) on this subreddit the hivemind was convinced he'll never be a midfielder for us.   

Yes his passing from deep is sometimes too risky, and yes he's not strong enough yet, but on the evidence of last night he has the ability to be a mainstay for us for a decade. Having a midfielder with the instinct to turn towards goal and attack every time he picks up the ball is extremely rare. Love him or hate him, we're a better attacking unit when he's on the pitch.",Liverpool,No,jam244m,t3_11fuqn5

"Not sure why people think Bajcetic is more of an 8 or more well suited to be an 8, he's looked solid there but when he's been a holding mid its clear his skill set is much better in that role.

Don't even think Klopp plans on playing him as an 8 long term either considering the rumoured transfer targets are all CM's so far.",Liverpool,No,jamog1i,t3_11fuqn5
I couldn’t watch last night so I don’t know for sure but could it be argued having that goal disallowed gave the motivation the lads needed to score 2? If so that’s a slight glimpse into the mentality of last season,Liverpool,No,jamgwda,t3_11fuqn5

"I was just looking at the reactions of the spurs fans recently, and i feel a bit bad for them not getting over the hump in terms of winning a cup, as a LFC fan we often take cups like the carabel or the FA cup for granted but honestly speaking if some teams just one of them they'd be over the moon, and it would mean so much. even united as much as despise the club winning a cup after a 6 year drought meant more and in there view is a catalyst for something big. if we are out of the CL which looks likely i wouldn't mind seeing spurs win it as unlikely as that prospect may look for them",Liverpool,No,janwuhr,t3_11fuqn5
I never liked Ronaldo but now I hate him more.,Liverpool,No,jaorkus,t3_11fuqn5
Remember in the summer when everybody who said Carvalho and Elliott aren't midfielders and wouldnt suit our system got downvoted to oblivion because the all infallible Klopp would make them the next Bernardo Silva? Right now its happening with Mount. Anybody saying hes not that good or he's not what we need is getting needlessly downvoted.,Liverpool,No,jamo24y,t3_11fuqn5

We seemed to have developed an obsessive compulsion to split the CBs and pull a midfielder back to make a back three and then pass between these three players for large portions of the game to pull the other team out. Seems so risky in my opinion.,Liverpool,No,jam49pt,t3_11fuqn5

"Would really like to see Doak on the left instead of the right, playing as a right footed  right winger as much as he suits that role does limit the options you have a bit whereas  on the  left  he could dribble past multiple players with option to pass or shoot instead of just having the cross as an option",Liverpool,No,janr54c,t3_11fuqn5

Meanwhile my 2nd (ish) team [stayed alive yesterday](https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2023-03-01/southend-united-confirm-clubs-14m-tax-bill-has-been-cleared), think they've been in this situation like 10 times before but always find the money *just* in time, it's a miracle. 🤨

Why couldn't they find it earlier and not put their fans through the wringer of will we have a club next week?

Important bit of perspective anyway, main club in a city half the size of Liverpool almost 💀 bc of a £1.4m tax bill. Darwin's agent probs got more than that, it's mental.

"As much as I’m really frustrated with the Keita situation, surely it isn’t his fault for being injured all the time? Feels like it’s down to the coaching team to realise his fitness was never going to fit Klopp’s style of training/play. Some of the joking comments are alright but a lot of them aren’t very kind",Liverpool,No,jam3f3y,t3_11fuqn5
"Really liked Harvey’s midfield performance in the second half, that was promising. Him Bajetic and Bellingham who says no?",Liverpool,No,jang3eg,t3_11fuqn5
We have looked solid since we went back to false 9. Nunez is a very different kind of player and the team hasn’t adapted to his style of play. His direct style of play stretches the game well but then he is caught up ahead with a big hole left in the midfield which is usually covered by our false 9 who is usually our first defensive player. Jota should continue for now. He gives all the benefits of a false 9 and is a better goalscorer than the other options.,Liverpool,Yes,jalgm5x,t1_jalfl17
I might be overreacting here but I think Bajcetic has single handedly changed the course of our season.,Liverpool,Yes,jalhb14,t1_jalfl17
So infuriating. It’s like he was getting off on calling us poor every 5 seconds before we scored. After we scored he barely said anything.,Liverpool,Yes,jalny9g,t1_jalg1h2
"Not only is he from Greater Manchester and history of making mistakes causing Klopp to say something but every game there is even more controversy. 

It's not like he has 2-3 games go by where he fairly/correctly officiates the games. Every time he's shocking and there are decisions that he's made where seemingly everyone agrees should go one way but he determines the opposite. 

He wants fucking off, not just binned from our games but out of the game completely.",Liverpool,Yes,jam35v6,t1_jam2lzd
I feel like you can put  the majority of Prem refereeing down to just incompitence instead of any bias but when a referee is so consistently shit for one team you have to look at there being some sort of bias.,Liverpool,Yes,jam3acy,t1_jam2lzd

"I just wish he decided to turn up vs. Madrid, we had a really good shot at winning this year's UCL",Liverpool,Yes,jan8ps6,t1_jampeii
I've convinced myself that his drop in form was first due to expecting his baby and then thinking about/caring for the newborn. His performance yesterday could mean the baby is finally letting him sleep a bit more!,Liverpool,Yes,jampsqe,t1_jampeii
The yellow for Fab especially was crazy. We aren't allowed to try to avoid getting two footed anymore.,Liverpool,Yes,jall88b,t1_jalhpjj
"I don’t see how that isn’t a foul. Don’t get me wrong, I was devastated that it was ruled out but regardless of him being “pushed” he clearly sticks out a leg to kick at the ball and instead just takes out the player (forgot his name).

He has proper main character syndrome.,Liverpool,Yes,jalx703,t1_jalvwkt
"Yeah. Very inconsistent. 

I mean maybe he figured Bajcetic was making a professional foul, that’s fair if you make that the line, but Wolves midfielders were allowed to just bear hug players to take them out of break aways.

"Rooney didn’t have a healthy lifestyle outside of football which definitely contributed to his downfall

"Klopps had run ins with Tierney before and you can see why, zero consistency in what he calls as a foul, last night wolves were allowed to kick the shit out of Bajcectic, I can see why Jota goal was ruled out from the still frames of the contact with Dawsons leg, but it doesn't take into account there were 3 players going for the ball, Jota got pushed by one defender into the other - anywhere else on the pitch likely not a foul",Liverpool,Yes,jalnau9,t1_jallohu
"Forget who it was but in 1st half we got a free-kick for someone basically getting kicked in the face, Wolves fans ""same old Scousers always cheating""

I know it's banter etc. but chanting that over some UFC shit? And what turned out as one of the only calls we got all night? 😡

"Tbh I get why the goal was disallowed. I believe Jota was pushed into the defender so it shouldn’t have been ruled a foul, but I get why they did say so. Honestly I thought the reffing was okay.

Yeah. I actually like Harvey in midfield when he has the right partners. Same story as with guys like Lallana and Ox. They can add much needed spark; but it falls apart if they don’t have more defensive minded midfielders to rely on.,Liverpool,Yes,jalyot3,t1_jalm9ll

"I hate FSG but I think even they aren't foolhardy enough to pretend like there's been no issue with our performance even if the end result is top 4

Konate was a year too late, but he was bought in response to 20/21's CB collapse. I have faith they'll go for a midfield revamp this summer, esp with Ox and Keita going (and possibly Milner) - I just don't have faith they'll spend enough to buy what we need, but that's a separate issue",Liverpool,Yes,jam6g8a,t1_jam53b6
"I really hope we do get top 4, but it seems unlikely atm; there's also no way FSG would think that would pass, I'd bet on us signing 3-4 players this summer, one of which would be a big name/money",Liverpool,Yes,jam6nyo,t1_jam53b6
"Mount can also play in a variety of positions, which could really help for cover. Could be, dare I say, the replacement for Milner (if that’s even possible)",Liverpool,Yes,jamg05f,t1_jamevod
I don’t think Mount would demand those high wages with us. The reason why he’s making those demands to Chelsea is because he’s been their best player for the last 3 seasons so he feels that he should be rewarded with a big contract. He hasn’t done anything to prove he deserves that big contract with us. I’d expect his wages to be around 150k a week if he joins us which is decent considering we’re getting rid of nearly 300k a week in wages with Ox and Keita,Liverpool,Yes,jamnj1n,t1_jamm79f
"The way we structure deals might show as low wages but our wage expenditure shows regardless that people earn exceptionally well here, although it’s clearly reward based rather than flat rate.

Mounts wage won’t be that high ofc but with bonuses potentially it might reach that.

Personally all the noise around I would be amazed if there hasn’t been tentative talks between the club and his agent already.",Liverpool,Yes,jamvpgt,t1_jamm79f

"Luca Stephenson was playing mindgames that led to the final missed penalty.

The Reds then run straight to our goalie. It looked like straight through the Porto player that missed.

"Its my preffered 3 that we go for as well

The homegrown issue might throw a curveball in though which is probably why we are wanting Mount",Liverpool,Yes,jam7zdp,t1_jam7oy2

"If I was him, I wouldn't sign. Chelsea are so high risk right now, their plan basically hinges on 70-80% of the players they've bought being good enough to play the next 5 years and selling the rest without too much of a loss.

"If Klopp can get his arm around him and tell him about how he is going to be part of a new 3 (Mount, Bajcetic and Jude anyone?), I think we can get him. 

Chelsea signing tons of talent on way more money should be enough to make him unsettled. Plus Chelsea fans treat him like dirt.",Liverpool,Yes,jam90h7,t1_jam5qd0
">Thing is you have to be stupid to turn down a move for Mount. He will turn it around.

Can I genuinely get an explanation on this please? So far i've only seen people in this thread saying we need him but rarely does anybody explain why.

">It simply makes no sense to me that he'd just fall off a cliff at 29 without even having had some massive injury, after having been a top 3 DM in the world for year

That is right.... But he has actually been on a decline for the last 12-18 months. I can remember saying a good few times last season about how poor he had been, especially in terms of how slow he was and how easily he was getting beat. But at the time we were winning every game so it doesn't even get picked up on. 

It's still bizarre as he's in his prime years really. And although he's been relied on a lot with no real cover. There is plenty of midfielders that have played more minutes than him so can't just be put down to being burnt out.",Liverpool,Yes,jamd591,t1_jam98f5

It’s okay the refs level the playing field by never calling any fouls on him so I guess everything even to the defenders.,Liverpool,Yes,jaqr90h,t1_jaogfnl
We should buy a DM regardless of emergence of bajcetic the midfield comes with a lot of workload not sure Stefan is ready for that type of load. We should look for hybrid type DM ugarte probably he can play as lone 6 also in pivot with bajcetic.,Liverpool,Yes,jam72lq,t1_jam17bz

We've seen flashes of what can do with his great progressive dribbling, he's pretty quick and powerful for a CM as well which helps with the dribbling aspect of his game but its hard to do that consistently when your team doesn't have a lot of the ball usually.",Liverpool,Yes,janir6b,t1_janc0ul

He played well but I don't think he was amazing to the point where Robbo should be dropped for him,Liverpool,Yes,janjg3o,t1_jangpzo
"Robbo needs to shore up his decision making going forward, always moving, but that end product just hasn’t been there, particularly in scenarios like the one Tsimi got his assist from. 

Defensively, we haven’t been great but can’t fault Robbo there, so that’s a toss up for me.",Liverpool,Yes,janjd2r,t1_jangpzo
"Yeah, kinda wish we went in for him. The lad was resolute that he wanted to stay in Barca but we were one of the teams most likely to turn his head and didn't try...probably because of his wages",Liverpool,Yes,jaoep7y,t1_jao3l7f

"Being ""found out"" is one of the most ridiculous cliches in football, like it's some great mystery how teams like to play and not obvious from watching them.

 Other teams have known for years how we like to attack and how we like to defend, but they haven't been able to stop it because we've been so good at it. This season several players are below their level from previous years, it's as simple as that.",Liverpool,Yes,jalqe5s,t1_jalmh09
"it‘s mostly bullshit because it‘s an easy excuse.  
it almost always comes down to players not performing like they used to.  
  
just look at ancelotti after real won the champions league against us last season. he said he knew exactly what to expect and that we‘re easy to adjust to play against. yeah, he tactically outclassed us, right. it‘s not like they had their keeper save their asses all game.",Liverpool,Yes,jaln65c,t1_jalmh09
We haven’t been figured out so much as we’ve just been shit.,Liverpool,Yes,jalot4e,t1_jalmh09
"People said the same thing in 2020/2021 and then we got 92 points the season after and almost won the quadruple

Sure, there might be some frustrating games here and there, but even prime Barcelona struggled to break down teams in the odd game

Klopp's system is very very effective and if he has the right players and are on form, we will win most games

Teams havent ""figured us out"" but more the players havent been good enough this year",Liverpool,Yes,jalp57f,t1_jalmh09
"There are videos out there but I watched too many and I can't recall which ones they were, sorry. But I'm sure if you just look at tifo football on YouTube or even medium.com you could find something there, that's where I get all my football analysis from.

From what I remember it's basically: Klopp's system relies heavily on 2 things to create goals
1. aggressive pressing in the attacking third and
2. our fullbacks

1 doesn't work anymore because everyone now knows this is how we win games so they stop trying to play out from the back and just hoof it long; they'd rather give us the ball in our own half than lose it in their own half, there's actually a lot of this analysis on medium.com but I can't find the specific articles, sorry again. 

Which is why Klopp has since transitioned us into a possession based side that relies on a mid-press instead, in an attempt to bait teams to play out from the back instead of hoofing long balls. 

(I swear there are direct quotes from Klopp and his team but I don't know where to find them right now I'm so sorry)

As for 2, once we transitioned to a possession based side that does a mid press instead of a high press, pushing the full backs so high up only leaves the flanks badly exposed. It was also a weakness with the high press but because our press was so good last time (both during the high press and mid press phases) the flaws weren't so bad. It's only now that everyone knows to target the flanks because they know our fullbacks are gonna be a little higher up, that's why defensively we've become so bad. It doesn't help either that our midfield has run itself down and people like Henderson, Fabinho and Milner don't have the legs to cover for our fullbacks as well as they used to, Wijnaldum was actually pretty good at doing this but we sold him :(. 

Couple this with the fact that teams know:
- fullbacks leave space behind them
- TAA is the defensively weaker of the 2 fullbacks
- you can't get pass van Dijk easily
- we defend with a narrow backline

the go-to tactic to breaking us down is simply to:

send the ball into the left channel (where Robertson is), drag our backline across, overload TAA with lots of tall people and then cross it over for them to head in.

that or

send the ball into right channel, 2v1 TAA (tho they could 1v1 him and still come out on top), drag the RCB and the RCM over, ping it back into the centre were because the RB, RCB and RCM are all dragged across, there's plenty of space in the middle now and they can create good chances from there. 

All these problems are just flaws with Klopp's system, every system has one, which is why you gotta keep evolving before the enemy catches up to you.

The offense problem existed ever since we stopped our high press system, the defensive one only got exacerbated really bad recently but we could still over-achieve and nullify those effects because Klopp got all our players into an overperforming streak. You can see how in our title winning season 19/20, we had to scrape through a lot of times. Our front 3 had to keep pulling tricks and moments of sheer brilliance out of their magic hats to win us games and this is reflected in our XG for that season. Again I don't have the numbers with me, I'm really sorry, but you can see that we massively overperformed our XG. 

We've been massively overperforming ourselves for at least 2 seasons now. the 20/21 season was a glimpse of what was to come if we didn't do a massive rebuild. That 10 game run at the end where we got 26 out of 30 points, how many of those were from overperformance and individuals stepping up when we needed it the most? Look at TAA's last minute strike against Aston Villa, or better yet, Alisson's only goal for us, the beautiful headed goal from a corner (""... a hero needed in red, or maybe black...""). We can't do that anymore because all of our guys are tired, years of nothing but a monster mentality and a fierce desire to keep going no matter what, no human can keep it up forever, not even our boys.

tldr: Teams have figured out the flaws in Klopp's system and because we haven't evolved quickly enough, they've caught up. Save for a massive rebuild (and maybe a squad overhaul), we aren't gonna be doing as consistently well as we used to.

It's the end of an era gentlemen, it's over for good. But that doesn't mean we are done and dusted, we just need to rebuild, be it minor system tweaks and completely tearing things down and starting afresh. But you can be sure that whatever change we do, there's only one man who can do it and take us into a new period of success. Juergen Norbert Klopp.",Liverpool,Yes,jalpm46,t1_jalmh09
"There are a bunch of videos discussing our downfall and what's wrong with our tactics but I haven't exactly found a video that says we've been found out. But teams kinda have figured us out through the years mostly because aside from blistering counter attacks, we mostly play a pressing high line, compact midfield and bomb our fullbacks forward. Now you could say City and Arsenal play the same way too but they haven't been figured out and you're partially right and the reason is they move the ball faster inside the opposition box and both teams play with creative technical midfielders that contribute a lot to their G/A. 

Ours on the other hand lack these creative midfielders. Something that we've been asking and craving for a while. Thiago kinda is creative but he doesn't score or assist much. That is why we've struggled over and over again to break low blocking teams. 

There's also teams targeting the space left behind from our fullbacks, specially on Trent's side. Of course this issue was always there its just that we had competent midfielders who covered these spaces. Our press also used to work meticulously so the opposition team didn't have much time to exploit these spaces but now they get all the time in the world because our midfielders don't don't close them down fast enough.",Liverpool,Yes,jalqhcy,t1_jalmh09
"I’ve done it 4 times now coming from the states, hospitality is the cleanest way. Do you overpay? Of course, but it’s great getting the anxiety of how and when out of the way.",Liverpool,Yes,janrkyy,t1_janawg1
"This question gets asked a lot and the answer seems to be the same. My understanding is hospitality is the only way. Depending on when the season starts, if its still pre-season when you are here then perhaps a friendly may be an option? Other possibilities could be going to an away game and sitting in the home end.",Liverpool,Yes,jancek2,t1_janawg1

They never really looked like scoring, was more nervy about us gifting them something...",Liverpool,Yes,jalp5n0,t1_jalgceu
"Yeah they had a low block, which essentially surrenders possession to avoid overloads in high danger zones. We’re good at counter attacking though, especially with Darwin on the pitch, so if a team presses us higher up the pitch, the outlets are there for us to hurt them. Nunez really looks like he’s settled and is seemingly improving every week, think he’s going to get a decent amount of goals before the end of the season.",Liverpool,Yes,jan7jsb,t1_jan4ta2

"A lot of people use him as a scapegoat.

He isn't that good in defensive aspects of his game but there were people blaming all our defensive problems in the 1st half of the season purely down to him as if it was his fault TAA, VVD and Fabinho were having nightmares.",Liverpool,Yes,jam2ojy,t1_jam244m
"I love Harvey and I'm desperate for him to succeed with us and fulfill his potential, and I agree that he gets slaughtered unfairly on here but...I dont think the strength issue is ever gonna go

He's so short that if he bulked up to the point where he could fit one of our 8 positions strength-wise he'd be way too stout and slow. It worked for Trent because he's like 5'11 and has the frame for it, and it could also work for Curtis because he's 6 foot plus, but if Harvey put on a stone or 2 he'd immediately lose a lot of his drive and explosiveness that makes him stand out in the first place",Liverpool,Yes,jam778b,t1_jam244m
"People saying he'll never be a mid for us are being ridiculous but he does need to bulk up if he wants to be a mainstay in the CM role longterm. 

I think he's fine at the moment in any game where we are expected to dominate but I wouldn't trust him to start at CM against top sides.",Liverpool,Yes,jam658n,t1_jam244m

"If  we get 2 or 3 CMs next summer, what do you see his role as being?",Liverpool,Yes,jan839z,t1_jamog1i

"It’s very invasive and the whole club, manager and players have to be on board. Plus people would have to be interested enough to watch too. 

Klopp has gone on record saying he would never consent to something like that happening during his tenure.

"Not at all over 12 games to go, anything can happen. I take a draw anytime over lost right now. We need to play prime Jose style to get into top 4. Win ugly , waste time when we are up. I honestly don't care.",Liverpool,Yes,jalhg5q,t1_jale6rw
"Elliot has played in midfield for all his Liverpool first team career, therefore he is a midfielder",Liverpool,Yes,jalsek8,t1_jals7j7

A lot of the players we buy don’t see to be at ‘the level’ we need but then with good training under Klopp they become world beaters. I can see that happening with Mount and Nunes because they’re clearly very talented players,Liverpool,Yes,jamnqwo,t1_jamk326

No?,Liverpool,Yes,janhxgn,t1_jang3eg
"I’m so torn on Elliott, Klopp clearly loves him, his attitude and desire is evident but if you watch him when he doesn’t have the ball, he’s a little scattered, ineffective on most close outs and physically doesn’t have the qualities that I think we need in that role. 

For example would I take Nunes over him, 100%",Liverpool,Yes,janjn5i,t1_jang3eg
His output on offense does not outweigh his vulnerability on defense.,Liverpool,Yes,jannwir,t1_jang3eg
"I know everyone says he doesn't have the pace for the wings but we haven't really tried it very much and we haven't got another backup for Salah there.

"Depends, you'd like a midfield that can progress the ball without needing one of the forwards to remove himself from the frontline to help out, one less body nearer to goal won't help us score. But if it works, it works.",Liverpool,Yes,jalpq44,t1_jalm60y
"The scheduling of the world cup has fucked it. The teams who went deep in all comps last year are struggling without the usual rest periods.

"It's not magic it's about game styles.

Trent grew up so fast,Liverpool,Yes,jalod5n,t1_jalo5cy
"I think I was less crazy about trent because I remember how crazy I was for flanagan. I remember flanagan’s first game, the crowd cheered ever tackle, every pass, it was amazing.

Also probably a bias against defenders :/",Liverpool,Yes,jalobn2,t1_jalo5cy

"It's easy to say ""not real fans"" ""not true supporters etc."" I get what you're saying that many probably aren't from Manchester. Although Hillsborough chanters who manage to get tickets to Liverpool away are almost certainly Mancs.

Im seeing grown men on Tiktok and Twitter get 100,000s of likes on posts responding to this. Grown men saying disgusting things and putting it on the Internet before even doing a quick Google search to realise what they're saying is completely false.

"Even giving squad players sub appearances to give rest to key starters is a good shout. If we're three goals up, then I don't mind Salah or Trent getting subbed off to get a breather now and then if we have quality backups and depth. 

Of course, with added depth, there's the added benefit of competition and rotation to mitigate injury risks and such players can easily fill in if the starters do get injured.",Liverpool,Yes,jao74n6,t1_janzt4r
I think that’s why we’ve seen kilman links as of late. Matip out kilman in?,Liverpool,Yes,jam82kn,t1_jam7zdp
Thurams duel rate success is pretty low. Sub 50%. Isn’t ideal for me,Liverpool,Yes,jam9zgf,t1_jam9rg8
"Still 4 trophies in a season has never been done before and also it means them winning the league aswell which is just terrible

Edit: In fact it's just them winning the league that bothers me they can win the other 3 (they probably will) I can live with that",Liverpool,Yes,jambbxm,t1_jamayqf
"Young midfielder with legs, no major injury record, homegrown 

What else do you need? Not every player is gonna be Bellingham level",Liverpool,Yes,jamj0op,t1_jama4ja
"At his best he's good at creating and scoring goals while still doing a decent amount of defensive work. Best comparison, IMO, is he'd be what Ox was meant to. Whether he'll turn it around I don't know.",Liverpool,Yes,jame4my,t1_jama4ja
the medical team: hold our beer,Liverpool,Yes,jamklv3,t1_jamgpw8
"A big reason for wanting Mount is that he's homegrown.

I'd rather Kone but Mount could be really good under Klopp he's a workhorse with good technical qualities and goalscoring ability from midfield.",Liverpool,Yes,jamgynz,t1_jamgbhz
"How can you say that when the team has an 18 yo who 2 months prior was playing u23 games starting every game 

Any midfielder who has legs is currently welcome, mount is a starter for Chelsea ( or at least should be ) and performed well under previous managers, Nunes is a 24 yo with no injury record 

If those 2 players don’t cost 80+M, it’s a good buy 

I don’t get this subs mentality of “this player is not good enough”",Liverpool,Yes,jamic9d,t1_jamgbhz
"I agree with this but that’s not to say Darwin hasn’t been great. He could finish more chances but just look at how we play without him. He’s essential for us. Def top 5 this season, I love watching him.",Liverpool,Yes,jamrajc,t1_jamaj8l
"My exact thoughts. 

When watching Salah this season he isn't as effective as he previously has been but 29 goal contributions in 34 games speaks for itself",Liverpool,Yes,jamcfsp,t1_jamapp1
"Agree with this. Our current tactic isn't getting all that we can out of Salah either, which has been incredibly frustrating.",Liverpool,Yes,jang9ly,t1_jamapp1
You're an absolute miserable bastard on this sub. You're on here constantly backing FSGs lack of spending yet you'll turn around and shit on the players? Weird behaviour,Liverpool,Yes,jamim6m,t1_jambov8
"Alisson, Salah, Bajcetic are the only ones who have been better imo.",Liverpool,Yes,jambuhd,t1_jambov8
The El Cashico,Liverpool,Yes,janeb87,t1_jamph3r
"He needs to get his confidence back. He had a brilliant tackle in the Wolves box, and then he fluffed an easy assist to Darwin because he passed as if he was afraid of the ball.",Liverpool,Yes,jama70u,t1_jam9mgf
There’s a definitely an argument to make that his defensive capability compensated for gaps at the back especially in who’s lining up next to vvd,Liverpool,Yes,jamalsu,t1_jam9mgf
I'm not against selling him either I'd still prefer that but I think if  Bajcetic is seen as the one to takeover that spot  then having Fabinho there as a rotation option isn't that bad.,Liverpool,Yes,jam1m1z,t1_jam1dd3
The thing  is if you sign someone like Ugarte they're likely going to start most games and that limits Bajcetic's chances.,Liverpool,Yes,jam26wz,t1_jam1fjx
United apparently also want him,Liverpool,Yes,jamma7v,t1_jamiaiv
"Think it was more a brain dead ref tbh. It was a foul, just a harsh yellow",Liverpool,Yes,janjsx0,t1_jandd5a
"Yea we did that for like 20 min, then we ran out of gas",Liverpool,Yes,jaogpkx,t1_jaogcao
"I’d genuinely pick Milner over Henderson for this right now, Milly has shown he’s adept at filling in at RB so can help cover Rashford and he’s honestly playing better than Hendo",Liverpool,Yes,jam39cl,t1_jam0td8
"I think Hendo atm should be on a one game on, one game off policy.  It doesn't have to work that way everytime but let him run himself into the ground, have a break, do it all over again.",Liverpool,Yes,jam2p1o,t1_jam10f4
I sure hope so,Liverpool,Yes,jan56dg,t1_jan4utx
"I don't doubt Kante is still good on his day, just can't comprehend the appeal here. Signing a player who you can maybe rely on for 30% of the season on his wages is absurd and not fitting of the type of risk a top club should be taking.",Liverpool,Yes,jao0121,t1_jan5nu5
[deleted],Liverpool,Yes,jamok6c,t1_jamjzzq
"I looked at the heat map for Bellingham this season and while he's pretty much everywhere on the pitch, there is a tendency to move right more than the left when going forward. I think Klopp is aiming for him to play the RCM role and then Mount would be the LCM since he clearly has a left side bias going forward.",Liverpool,Yes,jan1g02,t1_jamzfk7
We can focus on more than one player at a time- and we should,Liverpool,Yes,janbuzo,t1_jamzfk7
I'd take Kone + Mount + another CM/DM over Bellingham alone,Liverpool,Yes,jan8kt2,t1_jamzfk7
Jude will get number 8,Liverpool,Yes,japb68z,t1_jap6xt0
Yeah that’s the narrative I’m trying to understand. I think we’re just not executing perfectly.,Liverpool,Yes,jamf0vv,t1_jalp57f
Thanks for this. Very insightful. So it’s basically just lack of evolution and fresh personnel more than a tactical masterclass by like everyone in the world.,Liverpool,Yes,jameqit,t1_jalpm46
That interplay between Moutinho and Sarabia at the start had me worried.,Liverpool,Yes,jalwv6z,t1_jalp5n0
"You can tell Darwin has bought into the philosophy and system. Just wants to see the team win, I’m not worried about him at all.",Liverpool,Yes,jandxr1,t1_jan7jsb
Yep. Tough situation all around.,Liverpool,Yes,jalj0sn,t1_jalit8e
"I think we need to lose this outlook that the lad is being hard done by. Yes it's not ideal for the club that we have to rely on him but he will be absolutely buzzing, I don't feel for him at all.

Representing Liverpool at 18 is a fucking dream come true. Ask any of Fowler, Owen, Gerrard, Trent if they think people should have felt for them back then.",Liverpool,Yes,jallvx9,t1_jaljy90
He's meant to return to training proper this weekend,Liverpool,Yes,jam6iwr,t1_jam4vd4
"Play 3 at the back with Trent as the wingback, or 4222 with him as the wide midfielder.",Liverpool,Yes,jao4sci,t1_jao30i5
"Trent has 2 assists the whole season this year lol

If we start with Salah, Nunez, Gakpo/Jota, and have Diaz come off the bench, I'm sure we would be able to score 3 without Trent

Ideally Trent should start but Klopp doesn't seem to want to play him anywhere else on the pitch so I'm not sure where he would play 

Starting with Trent as the RB leaves us with Benzema/Vini 2vs2 against our CBs, which is...not ideal",Liverpool,Yes,jao5e01,t1_jao30i5
"Gomez started his Liverpool career at LB and was solid, played a lot of games at 19 years old. How long have you been supporting us?",Liverpool,Yes,japi65s,t1_jap7c1k
"Klopp and Pep have been converting number 10s into 8s and (false) 9s for a decade now, don't see that changing either. There's not much difference between an attacking 8 and a 10 anyway in a high press system, if you look at where Harvey is receiving the ball on average he's between our 9 and Salah. It's basically where you want him.",Liverpool,Yes,jamaynn,t1_jam8zam
"This isn't really true though. Plenty of players have bulked up a lot (Salah if you want an example close to home) and not lost pace. Adding muscle to the legs, the hips and the core is vital for every player between after they've stopped growing upwards.",Liverpool,Yes,jam8drx,t1_jam778b
I reckon he starts against Madrid.,Liverpool,Yes,jam6r07,t1_jam658n
"As a 6, he honestly has whats needed to be a world class holding mid in the future and you don't find those very easily so having one thats came through the academy is massive.

He just needs to bulk  up a bit and to keep gaining more experience there isn't any big holes in his game already at 18, apart from a little bit of sloppiness on the ball at times but thats something  thats will get ironed out over time",Liverpool,Yes,janhx93,t1_jan839z
"Imo he's either the starter at DM or he's the back up to a new DM after having lost a competition during the summer camp sessions. 

Jude and Thiago are the first-choice #8s with Henderson, a second new midfielder, a third new midfielder (maybe, depending on whether they sell Jones), plus Milner and Elliot as the reserves.",Liverpool,Yes,janfaz3,t1_jan839z
I'd be happy to be proven wrong:),Liverpool,Yes,jamyzoj,t1_jamy83a
"Finally, our gini replacement.",Liverpool,Yes,jam1u0n,t1_jam1mnm
"We haven't seen him at his best when he's played against us thats why, we have seen flashes of what he can do even yesterday he went on a really nice run past 3/4 players.

He's a legit great progressive dribbler,  I'm not convinced thats what we need if we are getting Bellingham as well though.",Liverpool,Yes,jam22sc,t1_jam1mnm
"We have done when the press doesn't work. Definitely. But we seem to have abandoned the press to do this entirely instead. Maybe I'm wrong, it just seemed to scream out at me yesterday.",Liverpool,Yes,jambc4e,t1_jam97ns
Definitely. Hope he’s fit all the way through the run in now. We need him.,Liverpool,Yes,jalf537,t1_jalez1g
Actually 14 games still remaining.,Liverpool,Yes,jali7io,t1_jalhg5q
Tbf he has plenty of time on his hands to make the transition into one later down the line,Liverpool,Yes,jansi4k,t1_janroxr
"Idk man. You could say the same about Nunez but in that case it was clear he had something special, even if he was/is very raw.",Liverpool,Yes,jamt6ir,t1_jamnqwo
More like 200m for 2 midfielders of that quality.,Liverpool,Yes,jamlsny,t1_jamlfuo
"I think we need someone like Bellingham , but someone like Casemiro not in position but a side changing signing, like what VVD did for our defense. And the third a guaranteed starter , Kone and kephram are both there between the 30-40m range",Liverpool,Yes,jamqpsp,t1_jamlfuo
Yeah alright a lot of people say no,Liverpool,Yes,januiff,t1_janhxgn
"Talking RW back up, I think long term we prep for Doak in that role, he looks like he has more explosive pace, two-footedness and an intangible aggression that I’d prefer to see over Elliott in the same role TBH. Up to the two lads to battle it out I guess.",Liverpool,Yes,janv2w5,t1_jantujk
Nearly 5 years in and I don't remember what it's like not to be tired.,Liverpool,Yes,jamuray,t1_jamr1ao
About to have my first end of May/June - why is it so exhausting?,Liverpool,Yes,jan7y6w,t1_jamr1ao
"You're probably right, but I saw the drop in form in the time when his wife would've been pretty pregnant to now being severe while end of last season felt more like he was exhausted. Obviously all hefty speculation. Just glad he put in a quality shift yesterday and optimistic it'll stick",Liverpool,Yes,jamyqyh,t1_jamslb4
"Fair enough, I can see that being true.",Liverpool,Yes,jandafa,t1_jamxuyo
"They are

The problem isn't the players they're signing on an individual level its how they are going about doing it, signing that many players at once, overpaying for a lot of them and I can gurantee Potter isn't even the one wanting them its Boehly so he's signing players the manager probably doesn't even want.",Liverpool,Yes,jam32zu,t1_jam2mq0
"You say that, but our success under Klopp was defined by a midfield that did not progress the ball and a forward helping out and we scored tons of goals, and moving away from that system has made us defensively worse.",Liverpool,Yes,jalreno,t1_jalpq44
"Since the disaster at Wolves and Brighton, we have tightened up at the back and the past month we have been good, we're slowly finding a way to get the attack up to speed too. If you spend all your time whinging about Henderson and FSG, then you won't have noticed it.",Liverpool,Yes,jamm8bo,t1_jami191
Definitely. But City walked into our trap. Utd on the other hand won't.,Liverpool,Yes,jalu76w,t1_jaltu4t
The Holy Boys,Liverpool,Yes,jam7ore,t1_jam1nxl
I love all my Bellinghams equally,Liverpool,Yes,jalzfmc,t1_jaly6e4
"he's promising, i reckon",Liverpool,Yes,jalyju2,t1_jaly6e4
"that‘s not what i‘m saying, though.  
we obviously need a constant flow of new players. that‘s one thing we idiotically didn‘t do in the last transfer windows. and it shows in the midfield. there we do need quite a few new players.  
but the attackers really are sorted imo. of course, if someone else might be available i‘m not against bringing in a new player but the front 3 are currently the least of our problems.  
  
what i meant by not needing much was more like the tactics are still working if we have a midfield that can run. we just don‘t have that right now.  
i‘m not defending fsg by any means, they can fuck right off if they don‘t provide funds in the coming summer window.",Liverpool,Yes,jalmzfb,t1_jalm97o
"Yesterday the commentator said something along those lines, he said Trent must feel like a veteran while playing alongside Harvey and Bajcetic. This reminded me on how far along Trent has come and how fast he grew up.",Liverpool,Yes,jalq20c,t1_jalod5n
I'll never forget when we beat City 3-2 and he flattened Milner (sorry James). Insane roar,Liverpool,Yes,jam1nx0,t1_jalobn2
Elliott do that too but he sometimes misplace the passes,Liverpool,Yes,jalnu9k,t1_jalnp4s
Ali kinda fucked him there tbh a lesser talent couldve looked real bad with that,Liverpool,Yes,jamgn0v,t1_jamfdla
"Above Barcelona in terms of sheer difficulty of progressing. Of course a round of 16 tie doesn't defeat a semifinal tie in terms of 'greatness' 

I don't think there's any argument that going to the Bernabeau with *this* squad is significantly more miraculous than what happened at home at Anfield against Barcelona. 

Coming back from 3 goals in one half is more difficult than 3 in a whole game so I would give the CL final the edge of course.",Liverpool,Yes,jaojda0,t1_jaoj1zb
"Spurs have much nicer remaining fixtures than us, we have a decent chance but spurs have got to be major favourites",Liverpool,Yes,jamamta,t1_jam8z5l
"Wouldn’t necessarily be for a season, but I’m sure he’d make himself available if the time called for it, regardless of the position he’s in, just seems like that type of player. Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that tho by getting our transfer policy rights so he shouldn’t need to play in a fullback role (if we get him)",Liverpool,Yes,jamnk21,t1_jamml5l
"Yes, he was the last one to take the penalty for Porto and he missed.

Edit: he took second to last penalty and missed that.",Liverpool,Yes,jalw5we,t1_jalvtk2
Pickford?,Liverpool,Yes,jao0gq1,t1_jany3ny
Ander Herrerat,Liverpool,Yes,jao1gxl,t1_jany3ny
Wouldn't be against it Kilman looks good especially on the ball but Wolves would probably ask for a lot of money.,Liverpool,Yes,jam8f0v,t1_jam82kn
Oh I didn't know that. Although I guess duel win rates can always be improved right? We could also look at Lavia or Onana (if Everton gets relegated). I think both of them are fantastic players.,Liverpool,Yes,jamalir,t1_jam9zgf
"Yeah it would be dreadful to see but still not the proper quadruple, city claimed one a few years back with the community shield",Liverpool,Yes,jambo2n,t1_jambbxm
"Technically they won  4 under Mourinho with both domestic cups,  Europa league  and community shield

Its like saying our 2001 treble is the treble when its not.",Liverpool,Yes,jambw8i,t1_jambbxm
">Not every player is gonna be Bellingham level

why get him then if were going for bellingham? bellingham does everything mount does but better and hes younger.",Liverpool,Yes,jamjodo,t1_jamj0op
what i dont understand is Bellingham is all that you just described about Mount and more. So why do we need to go for 2 similar profile players? Why not save the money and go for Kone? At least with Kone you know that he's going to be defensively solid.,Liverpool,Yes,jamk2dt,t1_jame4my
He does seem like the kinda player Klopp could get to the next level and make truly world class Ill give him that,Liverpool,Yes,jamhktg,t1_jamgynz
"Obviously Id take them in a second if its them or nobody but Id much prefer the other players I mentioned or Ugarte. I think these three are not a balanced midfield, they are all attack minded and there isnt a true dm there. Replace either nunes or Mount with say Kone and Im happy.",Liverpool,Yes,jamj48v,t1_jamic9d
">How can you say that when the team has an 18 yo who 2 months prior was playing u23 games starting every game

Huh? Maybe because Bajcetic is fucking good and a defensive minded mid? I mean imagine you have Mount instead of Bajcetic in this midfield, what the fuck will Mount provide? You think he's going to stick tackles in like Baj did yesterday? No fucking way. Imagine a midfield of Mount Elliott and Fab, like fuck me does that look good to you? I think you're out of loop here, Bajcetic isnt some kid that we're overhyping like we did with Jones. He's actually good thats why he's starting and fucking Jones is not. If any 18 year old would walk into our team then Jones and Elliott would have started games for us a long time ago.",Liverpool,Yes,jamllnx,t1_jamic9d
">I don’t get this subs mentality of “this player is not good enough”

Nobody said this. Theres a difference between a good player and a player that we actually fucking need. If we got linked to Neymar would you be content with it? He's a world class player but we dont need him.",Liverpool,Yes,jamm3oi,t1_jamic9d
Yeah easily top 5,Liverpool,Yes,jams4g8,t1_jamrajc
Yeah can't deny the fact his numbers are still really good but he's been very frustrating to watch this season a lot of the time.,Liverpool,Yes,jamd8ir,t1_jamcfsp
Because he's been shit.,Liverpool,Yes,jamlx0e,t1_jamim6m
"**Thiago** has been better. He even changed his style of play when what we needed was solidity, physicality, and ball-winning in midfield. 

**Robbo** has been better, as well. Perhaps his decision making in the final moment has been poor but his energy going forward and defensive solidity has been dauntless. 

I think Darwin has a bright future. And he has been a threat for us, but all of our forwards ""have been a threat"" this year, at various times. They've all struggled, too. Darwin's no different.",Liverpool,Yes,jamdhba,t1_jambuhd
Bajcetic? He wasn't even in the first team until like a month ago,Liverpool,Yes,jamrifw,t1_jambuhd
He has been brought in as a goal scorer and has less goals than Firmino while topping the missed chances stat. We're 10 points better off if he could finish.,Liverpool,Yes,jamc3ya,t1_jambuhd
">He needs to get his confidence back. 

Confidence doesn't make you 3 yards slower than the rest of the midfield though, he looks like a player that has lost loads of physical ability and you don't just get that back.",Liverpool,Yes,jame56m,t1_jama70u
"Agreed, also had some decent interceptions by closing early. It isnt all that special but it is what he has to do for now and build it up again",Liverpool,Yes,jamaguf,t1_jama70u
"Bajcetic can play across the midfield though. So he will have plenty of minutes. 

Currently our midfield is in bits. We've actually got no dependable top class quality players who we can rely on week in week out. 

Fabinho and Thiago at their peak are top class, but Fabinho has been run into the ground and Thiago is injury prone. Henderson and Milner are good quality players but aged and can't be relied on. Kieta and Ox are ridiculously injury prone. Jones doesn't seem to have got any better than he was 5 years ago when he's really at the age now where he should have been a regular in the starting 11. 


At the moment our 2 most dependable midfielders are Bajcetic and Harvey, who are teenagers and still very much developing. 

Signing even 3 top quality midfield players at this point wouldn't limit Bajcetic and Harveys development in the slightest.",Liverpool,Yes,jam4fhn,t1_jam26wz
"I'd agree if it was Rice or Tchouameni for example, but a player like Ugarte wouldn't be upset if he's sharing minutes with Bajcetic, I think.",Liverpool,Yes,jam3jva,t1_jam26wz
Bajcetic is likely going to be an 8 anyway,Liverpool,Yes,jam3m7p,t1_jam26wz
"Yeah the issue is that Klopp does not have a Plan B and instead of bunkering down the team in the area and play long balls for counter attacking he keep the same style which was suicide.

Madrid Favours space, don't give them that",Liverpool,Yes,jaoj442,t1_jaogpkx
I'd rather start Hendo and then sub him for Milner once his legs fall off around the hour mark.,Liverpool,Yes,jam6ien,t1_jam39cl
"People still getting downvoted for suggesting someone is better than Henderson. The state of this sub. At least if someone goes by Milner, they get knocked to the ground. Hendo just stands there and watches.",Liverpool,Yes,jan0d8i,t1_jamok6c
Its hard to predict what the plan is for Bellingham if he signs since he can play  every role in midfield to a really high level already.,Liverpool,Yes,jan2o0j,t1_jan1g02
No way we skipped last summer transfer window just to not buy him this summer transfer window? We will be a laughing stock,Liverpool,Yes,janbkye,t1_jan8kt2

"Yeah I agree. I think the biggest hole in his game at present is that he seems to tire after the 60 minute mark and becomes less mobile, but that will surely improve over time. Paul Tomkins has done excellent work on how players dramatically improve in their 20s, excited to see what the future holds for young Stevie B.",Liverpool,Yes,jank4n4,t1_janhx93

"Those VVD-like signings were a one-off thing. We just happened to get it thrice with him, Mane, Salah, and if you want a 4th I guess you can say Alisson. Honestly if we can get 3 new midfielders who are good (Mount & Kone tier) i'll take that over getting Bellingham",Liverpool,Yes,jan8z8k,t1_jamqpsp

"There's a common problem that businesses with a lot of outside capital run into - misallocation. We've seen this over the last decade in tech, where venture capital flooded in and businesses were able to sustain huge losses until the central banks stepped in and hiked. Now a lot of these companies immediately fired 30-70% of staff and had to trim a lot of (useless) opex to become more efficient profitable (or less lossy) machines.    

 I think the Brighton scouts are probably excellent at what they do - industry leading, in fact - but the usual process for buying a player would be to identify the type of player, have a long-list, get it down to a shortlist, see who is available, make a cost benefit analysis of each target and go for that player. If the player isn't available now then maybe you wait a year or move to your second target. Chelsea right now have been told that they MUST spend £600m this year and that they can sign every target they want. The process is accelerated and inefficient. It's wasteful and scattergun.   

I'm sure Boehly is a smart guy but that's probably the problem. He thinks he's coming to Europe to teach people how football should be done (just read his own comments) but there's a reason that a lot of things are the way they are and there's a reason why nobody historically has bought £600m worth of 23 year old talents in the January window and thrown them together under an inexperienced manager and expected everything to work. It'll be at least another 6 months and probably another manager before they know for sure if even half these players are actually good enough.",Liverpool,Yes,jam6gaq,t1_jam32zu
"But that was while we still employed a high press and created mainly from that high press. Now that we've become more possession based our midfield needs to do more to progress the ball than relying on a dropping forward.

Ideally in the summer we can get a midfield overhaul. Ox, Naby, Mikner and Jones can all be cleared out at minimum and that would mean if we could bring in 3 quality players those 3, Fabinho, Bajcetic and Thiago all competing for the starting 3 spots with Henderson and Elliott and backup supporting options when required.

">This is just conjecture, there's no evidence that building lean muscle makes you slow - it's universally understood to be the opposite. More muscles in your legs, hips and core make you faster (duh?)

For one thing, no it really isn't lol 1) its pretty basic biomechanics - there's diminishing returns on size = power = speed, which is why sprinters have big legs but not as big as hill cyclists or power lifters 2) footballers need a balance of fast *and* slow twitch muscles because they're in a hugely endurance based sport

And the main thing is that having big legs and hips rarely have direct impact on the ""strength"" of player relative to how we describe the strength of a footballer unless they play/run/shield a certain way like Hazard or Wijnaldum

Harvey certainly does *not* carry a football like those two, and is very upright when going into duels, and would need a bigger back, shoulders, arms and chest  to shield better.

That Barca side easily walked the league that year, I think they were on another level 

Going into that game, we were not at full strength, which I think reduced our odds even more compared to this game. We're (hopefully) going in with a full strength side against Madrid, I don't think anyone wants any youngsters to start in that game

I'm not saying a comeback is likely to happen against Madrid or anything, but I think that Barca result is easily one of the most miraculous comebacks of all time and would edge it ahead of a comeback against Madrid in terms of difficulty",Liverpool,Yes,jaopk90,t1_jaolwvx

> Joe Gomez had the same thing where he bulked up his upper body  

Exactly, it's just useless muscle for footballers. They need a strong core, hips, glutes and legs. Feel like I've said this half a dozen times now. But bulking up those muscle groups will also make him faster as long as he doesn't overdo it.

Definitely not, adult don't suddenly get a lot faster, even an Olympic sprinter - who trains in a fraction of the aspects a footballer needs to train - will only get marginally faster once they've gone through puberty

"The Times reporting that Arsenal are confident of beating Chelsea to Rice for £80m this summer, that's another midfielder we've had links with off to someone else from the looks of it.

"It's crazy to think we would have recorded a loss if we would have won the cl or Pl last season as it would mean FSG would have to pay more bonuses to players and staff. 

It would seem the way we are structured as a club under FSG, finishing runners up is more beneficial to the owners than winning the league or cl. 

That's why it makes sense they invest minimum into the club, just enough for us to keep challenging for the top four,  ambitious managers like Klopp are actually a hindrance to their own model rather than an asset. 

That's why Arsenal owners released they needed to rip apart their model and had to back Arteta in the transfer market or face the wrath of the Arsenal fanbase which was already at their necks. 

Fsg might be at a similar stage where they decide to either back Klopp or turn the fanbase against them.",Liverpool,No,jaicv8x,t3_11evwv9

He is also press resistant, good at ball progression, good passing stats as well. Even his interception rates are quite decent and a good block percentile. 

I think Bellingham and Kone can form a strong partnership together. 

Also he would cost less than say Caicedo who would cost something around 70 mill plus and Rice who Westham around 80 mill. Kone is as good as them and would cost half the price.",Liverpool,Yes,jaijlu0,t1_jaigjgh

">They're not going to spend.

Yes that's why actual investment is paramount especially this summer. Imagine if you are Klopp and how would he feel especially when he came out and said the owners need to put in money this summer. He would feel betrayed if he didn't get backed in the window, especially after all he has done for the club with less resources than any manager in the top 6.

Where have they said that?,Liverpool,Yes,jahia0c,t1_jahevk9
I park down whitefield road they have load of free parking down there and then it's about a 10 minute walk down to the ground. Isn't bad getting out of there after either.,Liverpool,Yes,jah36yu,t1_jagoanj
You'd have to be an idiot to go to city with the charges hanging over them.,Liverpool,Yes,jahy87d,t1_jahtqxu

"I saw the patrick berger update on red men YouTube channel. The way he said it would seem, he either wants to come to us or remain in Dormuntd for another year if we dont make cl (but that would mean he is no longer eligible to be classified as home grown in PL if he doesn't makes the move this summer)

Don't think any top athlete would go to Man city at the moment especially with that case hanging over their heads. It would be a PR suicide especially for someone like Bellingham who has painted himself as a player who cares more about the sporting merit of a project rather than money.",Liverpool,Yes,jahvi14,t1_jahtqxu

De Bruyne by some distance for me,Liverpool,Yes,jaiah8k,t1_jai9q6k
Fabregas was also an underrated player why don't you include him into the conversation as well. He seems to have been a forgotten talent nobody talks about.,Liverpool,Yes,jaidw5h,t1_jai9q6k

"Yes and no. 

I do think a few very good players is what’s needed, particularly if we are aiming at doing something noteworthy in the 23/24 season. 

I think we ideally get just two midfielders. One #8 and one #6. If we did that, (don’t need you lot to comment on size of the if) we would probably be able to build something pretty amazing from there. 

I know it sucks but we have to fix the starting 11 before we start worrying about the depth too much.",Liverpool,Yes,jaicccw,t1_jahqk1t

"The new justification I saw recently was that Qatar ownership wouldn't make a difference for Man Utd.

"The investment talk is just laying the groundwork for the summer excuse. There won't be investment. Then they'll say our budget will be 'modest' because of no investment. Add that to the no CL excuses and FSG are cooking up another top tier non-transfer window.

"FSG do not care if we win trophies. FSG manage us like a business, not a sports club. All FSG cares about is the bare minimum, they *will not* spend their money to make us more successful.

"How do they benefit from this ""propaganda"" exactly?

A 3rd party would invest to either a: test the market with a view to eventually investing more/full sale or b: invest with the projection that even with the investment required in the squad, it'll prove lucrative over time.

Not everything is a conspiracy, this is just business to these people.",Liverpool,Yes,jahx1u9,t1_jahrwtj
"I think the plan is to sell the club to an investment group bit by bit and over time. That's the exist strategy fsg seems to have decided over instead of being bought out in on go. I wouldn't be surprised if they end up selling their stake and becoming a minority owner at the club and eventually selling their stake and getting out.

It's more of a medium term to long term planning than immediately getting bought out.",Liverpool,Yes,jahsufq,t1_jahrwtj

"3 midfielders are the starters

What about the other midfielders that will leave on a free?",Liverpool,Yes,jah7k7p,t1_jah5oj1
"Agreed. My hope is we replace Ox, Keita, Fabinho and Gomez/Matip with four quality first team players. No Sepp Van Den Bergs or Adrians, please.",Liverpool,Yes,jah8fsx,t1_jah5oj1
I think some people forgot how difficult it is to incorporate new players too. You can’t just change half the starting 11.,Liverpool,Yes,jahjg39,t1_jah5oj1
"I think that's a slight exaggeration there a lots of people who wouldn't be that surprised if we didn't get him, especially if he went to Madrid.

"The psychology of upvotes/downvotes is actually incredible. If people see a conversation where someone is upvoted and the person replying is downvoted, there's an immediate tendancy to side with the upvoted person.

This is very realistic... I am ready to be disappointed with our summer transfer antics,Liverpool,Yes,jahqrc3,t1_jah8bmb
"There isn't much difference in terms of prize money in winning the league or coming runner up. 

The winner gets about 44 mill and runners up get about 41.8 mill. Even if you make the top four the disparity between winning the league and making top four isn't much. 

While in the champions league the max sum you can get for winning the competition without losing any group stages is a sum of about 85.14 mill euros. 

We got around 81 mill euros for making the final in Kviy some year back.

So again the difference wouldn't be much, we might have actually earned more than even Real Madrid considering they lost a group stage game to Sheriff and lost a game or two over two legs on the way to the final. 

The amount of money going into paying bonuses and incentives to both players and staff would have actually put us into the red when the reports would have come out.",Liverpool,Yes,jaimick,t1_jaik7ue

"The flipside to that is that it takes zero analysis and tactics if Klopp did play a Henderon-Keita-Milner midfield tonight. It was genuinely the most horrible midfield 3 performance I've ever watched for this club.

For jude, someone who says himself and has shown, its not about money, and he very much cares about success meaning a lot. City isn't a good fit because they're cheating cunts where success means fuck all.

United is a decent project but we've still been far better over the last 5 years and players look at that more than 1 season.

What we know for sure is that they don't want to use their own money for funding a rebuild but are happy to use others. 

So I don't see why they would go all the way to put out news that they are seeking investment into the club, have Klopp come out and make statements putting pressure on them to fund a rebuild and then back out of all of that at the last moment.

That would just make them public enemy number one, spark a civil war in the fanbase and most importantly lower the evaluation of their own asset.

">Why would you pour your own money into an already profitable business?

But Fabregas had a longer peak than any of these players and his versatility would put him over any of these names for me at least.

He started off at age 16 in an arsenal side which had proper leaders like Veira, Gilberto Silva in midfield and still broke in and he was playing at a good level even in his 30s and  could play so many roles from deep laying playmaker to a 10 or even false 9 so effectively.

However many millions the city spend, without him they are trash.",Liverpool,Yes,jaidtkf,t1_jaicf9x
">with the slowest striker's up-front with him

It isn't Fifa mate haha. 

Giroud has been a top striker for the last 10 years, there is a reason he's played for the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea and Milan. Winning WC, Serie A, CL, EL, multiple domestic cups. As well as being Frances all time top scorer.

Using him as some sort of an excuse and like he was a burden on Ozil is totally invalid haha",Liverpool,Yes,jaiftrm,t1_jaicf9x

">but if you want to sell nobody will give more than half the value

There's a nice trick I learned where you can get more for selling players, you basically offer to clubs for a really low amount and that catches the AI's attention and then you keep raising the price little by little until you get what the players value should be.",Liverpool,Yes,jairw5t,t1_jairelg

I don't care if the majority of fanbases have civil fans, especially when it's large international clubs like Chelsea. When there's a far too significant portion of a fanbase behaving like Scum, that deserves to be called out.",Liverpool,Yes,jai9wpb,t1_jai6lc2
That's fair.,Liverpool,Yes,jaiee1c,t1_jaidtkf
"Giroud pace couldn't keep up with Ozil playmaking. This was widely known. Also, it's a reason why he's constantly shipped off to multiple clubs because he gets benched because of his pace.

">It's not going to drop. Liverpool is a household name and one the most famous clubs in the history of the game

If they don't allow the funds for the transfers that we  need then we will  continue to drop because it would mean less chance of getting in the CL which will lead to the value dropping over time.

We've never been in this position where the funding is so badly and clearly needed so literally no one can say with confidence that we won't spend just becuase of previous seasons where we didn't.",Liverpool,Yes,jahxay1,t1_jahvk2g
"So if you get more money for winning, and we'd have paid more if we won - why have you decided, based on nothing at all, that the bonus would scale more than the prize money? Why would the club not base the prize money they give out on the money that they win?",Liverpool,Yes,jaiv0z6,t1_jaiuh3d
"Thanks lad, wasn't quite sure why that comment was made. It's like people want others to appeal to the majority and they become insulting. But, I appreciate you.",Liverpool,Yes,jaiepu4,t1_jaieip6

"> why have you decided, based on nothing at all, that the bonus would scale more than the prize money? Why would the club not base the prize money they give out on the money that they win?

Cause we made a loss last time we won the cl so it's not based in nothing at all. Use some common sense our profit is 7.5 mill not 50 mill.

Hence the accusation thrown at FSG that they invest minimum in the club not to win but to just to maintain a top four finish.",Liverpool,Yes,jaivhtw,t1_jaiv0z6
You do not understand comprehension. I am rooting for you.,Liverpool,Yes,jaivofn,t1_jaivk27

Could've funded our EPL 2 title charge with that money /s,Manchester City,Yes,jb1d97w,t1_jb1d20w
7 now 😂😂😂,Manchester City,Yes,jb1dz06,t1_jb1dfqo
"Lol no Pep team has conceded 6 goals, and the 5-2 Leicester loss was the only time a Pep team conceded 5 goals. ETH isn’t even top 3 in the league.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1f7gu,t1_jb1edon
Well them being back can't affect us at this point I guess. Just need Madrid to knock them out next week so they focus on their top 4 chase.,Manchester City,Yes,jb1g7co,t1_jb1frud
Why not both?,Manchester City,Yes,jb1g9vd,t1_jb1frud
Fuck one time i was sure the rags were gonna win and they get fucking battered. I'm searching for the highlights lol,Manchester City,Yes,jb1molg,t1_jb1jfpg
It was mind-blowing! Enjoy the highlights/replay!,Manchester City,Yes,jb1nee9,t1_jb1kqht
"if you live in the States, you can probably catch the full replay on Peacock. If not, Nbcsports will have extended highlights on youtube",Manchester City,Yes,jb233bs,t1_jb1kqht
"Wouldn't even class the 1-1 Leipzig with the others. Everton and Forest are gimmes for title challengers, really. Leipzig (A) is a tough knockout fixture to navigate, because of what Guardiola says german crowds and teams can be like. They had all the signs of a team that could shock City: top crowd, pace in behind and energy in bags.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0n5x1,t1_jb020xz
Love how Barca fans are trying to distance themselves by saying “Bartomeu” was responsible for everything. As if he wasn’t their president or elected by them and doing things that favoured their club.,Manchester City,Yes,jb0ofyc,t1_jb0i7yh
What happened now?,Manchester City,Yes,jb0qtle,t1_jb0i7yh
🤝,Manchester City,Yes,jb18zka,t1_jb18ejb
"Can't even imagine that. Gundo is a class act. Fernandez is just rat trash. 

But the difference is that if Gundo did that, he'll get booked, but rat can go on without any bookings.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1dee3,t1_jb1cf7c
"He's 100% still that guy, they just need more technical quality in their team.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1cm6a,t1_jb1cfn4
"had me in stitches ngl

Liverpool and Utd are what paying the media's bill so yeah,Manchester City,Yes,jb3got3,t1_jb2ah7v
Ahhh music to my ears,Manchester City,Yes,jb3nc34,t1_jb3b5l5
Nah a 9-0 mayhem (Burton Albion style) would have felt more appropriate if Pep felt like it.,Manchester City,Yes,jb3jv85,t1_jb3j0dp
Next season,Manchester City,Yes,jb4bxx4,t1_jb3j0dp
Definitely. Without him our team just wouldn't be the same this season,Manchester City,Yes,jazkjqt,t1_jazi1oh
His interception was phenomenal in the box in the first half. That shot was going in. Ruben had an equally flawless sliding interception in the second half.,Manchester City,Yes,jazlhm2,t1_jazi1oh
Ake and grealish if he maintains his current form should be nominated alongside haaland.,Manchester City,Yes,jazuq8s,t1_jazi1oh
Definitely. Attacking players get all the limelight but Ake and Rodri have been our most consistent/important players this season.,Manchester City,Yes,jazteiz,t1_jazi1oh
"Might sound a bit strange but Akanji would also be eligible in my opinion. Seamlessly integrated into our squad and has put in an incredible amount of minutes. I think we would have had a massive trouble with depth (both at RB and CB) without him.

As much as a I love Haaland I would enjoy seeing either Rodri Ake or Akanji take the prize.",Manchester City,Yes,jazyrdi,t1_jazi1oh
"Nah, United to lose. Scousers are nowhere near the title race.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0ufrd,t1_jb08zkj
same. can both teams lose?,Manchester City,Yes,jb0o26e,t1_jb08zkj
The only time I will celebrate a Liverpool goal,Manchester City,Yes,jb14npd,t1_jb1499z
Would always favour Liverpool over United as long as they are not our title rival,Manchester City,Yes,jb18kmf,t1_jb184mq
"Bruno still leading that race by a comfortable margin, but yes Garnacho is in the mix now",Manchester City,Yes,jb19pll,t1_jb19k2r
Glad to see it’s not just me that thinks he’s got a punchable face.,Manchester City,Yes,jb19rvt,t1_jb19k2r
"Not his fault though, that’s a requirement to join them",Manchester City,Yes,jb1a84u,t1_jb19k2r
I was thinking exactly this thing.,Manchester City,Yes,jb1a0p8,t1_jb19k2r
United Lose,Manchester City,Yes,jb1cpmp,t1_jb1cf5n
Don't forget the greatest CDM in football history.,Manchester City,Yes,jb1fvg3,t1_jb1ehlm
9D chess from Utd to con Liverpool into thinking theu can come back only for RM to snatch it away,Manchester City,Yes,jb1hyzv,t1_jb1hcfa
Liverpool are down 5-2 going to Madrid for the second leg. No chance they overturn that.,Manchester City,Yes,jb1lvzv,t1_jb1hcfa
I wonder if its Plantar fasciitis..... that can be nagging and the only way to fully heal it is to not use that foot.,Manchester City,Yes,jb3142q,t1_jb2fb95
in this day and age how hard is it to just diagnose that thru an MRI ffs,Manchester City,Yes,jb2id9x,t1_jb2fb95
The butcher got butchered,Manchester City,Yes,jb1b5ro,t1_jb1ajm1
"Would be nice if Liverpool caught the hubris bug and got their teeth kicked in next game

Edit: they have Bournemouth away next. So maybe not. But the one after that.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1nhg0,t1_jb1mzdt
Liverpool did it multiple times too in the last 5 years but still an npc,Manchester City,Yes,jazli06,t1_jazl977
KDB will arrive precisely when we need him. I just feel like he’s going to have some good moments before this season ends.,Manchester City,Yes,jazgszu,t1_jazfawd
Dw I'll sort it out. I just need my sparring gloves.,Manchester City,Yes,jazuw4q,t1_jazfawd
"They were supposed to be back under Mourinho, then Ole, now Ten Hag… you’re definitely right.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1bvri,t1_jb1awhi
they also go hammered at Brentford 4-0 😂,Manchester City,Yes,jb1frnh,t1_jb1f293
Jude like a TAA instagram post.... he's going to Liverpool for sure now 😂😂,Manchester City,Yes,jb2s12u,t1_jb2i2p0
What?,Manchester City,Yes,jazpasr,t1_jazo0we
a draw is the way,Manchester City,Yes,jb177mg,t1_jb16z5g
On April 1st🫠,Manchester City,Yes,jb1asa0,t1_jb1aflt
Don't worry arsenal have to play them at anfield,Manchester City,Yes,jb1bj4b,t1_jb1bc2w
"i mean assna still have to play at anfield, at least we are at home",Manchester City,Yes,jb1bgfd,t1_jb1bc2w
We already lost to Liverpool at Anfield. They’re not the same at the Etihad.,Manchester City,Yes,jb1bmbg,t1_jb1bc2w
They turn up against us regardless of form. May as well enjoy them destroying United,Manchester City,Yes,jb1blry,t1_jb1bc2w
Doesn't matter because they always turn up against us anyway,Manchester City,Yes,jb1bwlk,t1_jb1bc2w
It's Anfield.,Manchester City,Yes,jb1bh1b,t1_jb1bc2w
[deleted],Manchester City,Yes,jb1c8od,t1_jb1bc2w
Imagine if they came back against Madrid. I would be impressed tbh,Manchester City,Yes,jb1nad5,t1_jb1m1ci
"Yeah I’m really torn bc I’d like to see either side get battered, but I think a draw easily makes the most sense for us.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0z2wa,t1_jb0yla6
It’s bullshit… our 6-1 and 6-3 win over united looks amateurish,Manchester City,Yes,jb1e6xc,t1_jb16sh5
"Well, its a win-lose scenario. Liverpool in top 4 is losing scenario but at least seeing utd lose is such a satisfying thing.",Manchester City,Yes,jb190wa,t1_jb18uk9
Yeah I was really looking forward to them missing out. Spuds and Newcastle won’t get the job done.,Manchester City,Yes,jb19hzt,t1_jb18uk9
4,Manchester City,Yes,jb1a8cr,t1_jb19w72
Tbh I still think Diaz gets in before Nunez or Gakpo,Manchester City,Yes,jb1dtyh,t1_jb1d7dg
"PSG might also pay a lot, since one of their FB's is currently uh facing some potentially bad charges.",Manchester City,Yes,jb12qig,t1_jb0yt1t
Remember the last time we sold a LB to a rival?,Manchester City,Yes,jb1532z,t1_jb0yt1t
"scripting would take over and try to get atleast 1 undeserved goal in and try to make it 7-1 or 7-2 even. 

But I also suck at fifa and you should ignore my takes.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1gmw4,t1_jb1dwdk
"Jack Grealish by far. He was superb yesterday, even without any goal contributions.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0h0co,t1_jazf3wq
They both had a meh game but Grealish was clearly the more impressive of the two.,Manchester City,Yes,jazlopo,t1_jazf3wq
Agreed. Mahrez is clutch but foden is absolutely undroppable and grealish is on fire rn,Manchester City,Yes,jazk7mx,t1_jazk3u6
Been saying since Day 1 that Foden is better suited for the right wing. I hope Pep keeps putting him in that spot the man is an absolute menace coming in on his left foot,Manchester City,Yes,jb0k22y,t1_jazk3u6
instant yellow for City players lol,Manchester City,Yes,jb14ir8,t1_jb14atf
"Bernardoooooo Silva

Running down the wing

Silva

Makes the blue boys sing

Silva

We are going Istanbul*

(*location change for CL final each year)",Manchester City,Yes,jazsa2u,t1_jazikl9
Last time i backed liverpool to make it top 4 they almost won the UCL lmao,Manchester City,Yes,jb180ux,t1_jb17k4h
For once I actually enjoyed him ripping apart the opposing defence haha,Manchester City,Yes,jb18aty,t1_jb181iv
"IDK, Man Utd are a shadow of Real Madrid, lacking the silky one-touch passing to capitalize on counters. Anything is possible but Real Madrid is likely to just park the bus in the second leg even more than usual.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1bs59,t1_jb18par
"Whole back line got absolutely rinsed by the same play Chelsea used in the FA Cup semi final to score on us. Incredible how we let the same thing happen to us twice. Walker pinched up and got caught out the way Cancelo had before, and Zinchenko was too slow to react on the other flank.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0128r,t1_jazvdtb
"The only one that I think there’s any argument for is Zinny, his presence was huge regardless of if he was playing or not. I think that’s something that we’re now missing and has also been a huge advantage to Arsenal.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0btx0,t1_jb030zr
"I mean having the current version Sterling wouldn't really have helped us much, his old form doesn't seem to be coming back. Jesus we straight up upgraded on so that's not a problem. The one we miss most is Zinny and that too because our starting LB decided to have a temper tantrum, we were at least alright in the fullback department before that.",Manchester City,Yes,jb07mih,t1_jb030zr
"You cant please everyone

. If Rodri was penalised for his handball against everton (who then score the pen and we tie) and pool won the league , everyone would scream "" pep should have signed a striker, we need a proper #9""
This season, we aren't winning so now the narrative is we are better without a striker.

The reality is this season we are very slow and lethargic. Too many players with shocking form and poor attitude. If we kept players like sterling, the dressing room would be a mess because he really didn't want to be there.

Arsenal have been extremely hungry this season. Every player works Thier ass off. Our players,  for whatever reason have been extremely of the mark all season, bar a few individuals - so it's not easy to say .",Manchester City,Yes,jb0o3bz,t1_jb030zr
"Is the video suggesting we made a mistake by selling three players for around £130mn while admitting the difference they made was only 5pts over 26 games? They can’t have simultaneously been an essential part of our team but only leave a small gap in their absence. That logic isn’t logic-ing for me.  

On the other hand, if the video’s suggesting that the three players leaving was part of a much needed squad shakeup, which has an adjustment period and was exacerbated by the World Cup, then yeah, I can see their point.",Manchester City,Yes,jb04rsk,t1_jb030zr
Not replacing them with proper profiles is why.,Manchester City,Yes,jb05dj6,t1_jb030zr
I guess at one point these players need to move on if they don’t think City best place for their career. It’s just Pep can’t guarantee any starter. It’s normally team could be volatile when players in and out but look at Grealish - most our players could easily get interstates second year onward. Probably not our year this year but we are always there.,Manchester City,Yes,jb0abjr,t1_jb030zr
"There's some truth in that. Those three players were very much core players, been there done that. Now replacing player to player we have done that otherthan Zinchenko but the experience that Sterling and Jesus had we lost that this season, plus new players are taking time to gel, to understand Pep and his tactics, playing with a no 9 after 2 yrs, will take time to fully adjust. So if you add all things together than yea.",Manchester City,Yes,jb051x5,t1_jb030zr
Keep dreaming mate😴🤣,Manchester City,Yes,jazxpsj,t1_jazkin5
Hmm very detailed dream lad,Manchester City,Yes,jazumq5,t1_jazkin5
Why do you remember your dreams so much,Manchester City,Yes,jaznfe8,t1_jazkin5
He would always be at the physio instead of with the team. Please no.,Manchester City,Yes,jazwyxz,t1_jazpa3x
Plays about 3 games a season. No,Manchester City,Yes,jazt56o,t1_jazpa3x
"Don't need him, too injury prone.",Manchester City,Yes,jazr2xd,t1_jazpa3x
"I love KT, if he could stay fit I’d 100% be onboard but he’s always injured.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0c0cn,t1_jazpa3x
Red for both Marcus and Casemiro and watch rags fall apart without them.,Manchester City,Yes,jb00vo2,t1_jazndv6
Hahahahah I just saw the score! 7-0!? WHAT!?,Manchester City,Yes,jb1sa1b,t1_jb1mznd
Bahahahaha i wasnt expecting it either!,Manchester City,Yes,jb3sj14,t1_jb23wx7
"At times like these, i honestly wish we had smashed fucking everton at home and forest away. Would have made our next 12 matches bearable.",Manchester City,Yes,jazx3cv,t1_jazqwwn
"still a few bogey stadiums...  Sellhurst and St Mary's have been troublesome grounds in the past. 

Going to Brighton and Brentford will also be difficult. I still fear Liverpool, even if it is at the Etihad. They always show up against City, no matter what form they are in. At Everton at the end will be tough since they could be fighting relegation, and we looked bad against them at the Etihad. I think going to Craven Cottage could be a tricky fixture as well. 

City can do it though. It will be difficult but it can be done.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0hoxr,t1_jazqwwn
NEVER FELT LIKE SINGING THE BLUES...,Manchester City,Yes,jb1gq8i,t1_jb1eo3y
"Liverpool at Anfield just play different, I don’t know why. There’s also a desperation at the end of a season that drives top teams.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1huap,t1_jb1heei
"I think they'll win, Pool haven't lost to Arsenal at anfield since 2012 lol",Manchester City,Yes,jb1qvwz,t1_jb1ome3
"Lol they’re insecure, I don’t think even they believe their lead will stay",Manchester City,Yes,jb0l1eh,t1_jb0gh0t
"The likes of Terry, Lampard and Drogba were very technical as well. But they were more renowned for their competitive and tough nature. I mean Mourinho’s teams at their peak were technically brilliant as well but not as nimble. 

I think our current team is more inclined towards Mourinho teams than how you would visualise a typical Pep team.",Manchester City,Yes,jazvisd,t1_jazujsw
Martinez and Antony honestly look like they are more level-headed than bruno and Shaw.  All 4 of them did horrible things this match but only the former 2 were aware of it. Bruno and Shaw literally dared the refs to card them.,Manchester City,Yes,jb1iub8,t1_jb1glr3
"in-form Salah is not something even the best version of Ake would want anywhere near him. No shame in admitting that. 

Just like how liverpool don't wanna see an in-from ( or even out of form) bernado anywhere on the pitch.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1hv8g,t1_jb1halh
😂😂,Manchester City,Yes,jb1f3g2,t1_jb1d97w
And 3 of those Leicester goals were pens.,Manchester City,Yes,jb1h17i,t1_jb1f7gu
Yeah I’m just worried about the first game back after international break.,Manchester City,Yes,jb1gnlw,t1_jb1g7co
"It's worrying me now because we still have to play Liverpool. It's at home thankfully but the last thing we need is them suddenly finding form.

I guess Arsenal still need to go to Anfield at least.",Manchester City,Yes,jb2jck1,t1_jb1molg
"I classed Leipzig and Forest separately because I thought those were games where we didn't perform terrible, rather, in those games we were either not clinical enough or the opposition were great. 

In games like Everton and Brentford, it just felt like I was watching a City team I couldn't recognise.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0nph4,t1_jb0n5x1
"It’s a fact my friend, it’s a fact 🤣",Manchester City,Yes,jb1lpqy,t1_jb1lm9m
"I think Akanji had a really solid start, but has sort of gotten worse as the season has gone on? I don’t know, but he isn’t playing to his first few game standards he was.",Manchester City,Yes,jb06ivf,t1_jazyrdi
"no, need them to finish outside top 4",Manchester City,Yes,jb0zyal,t1_jb0ufrd
Never felt more like singing the blues,Manchester City,Yes,jb1cynt,t1_jb1cpmp
"he may be waiting until summer for surgery, this was a big year with the world cup in the middle. I have a feeling we will see a lot of players having surgeries this summer that they have put off. Hell,  Kev still hasn’t had his ankle completely addressed.",Manchester City,Yes,jb2vxx3,t1_jb2id9x
"I mean, Bournemouth almost got the result against Arsenal, so you never know",Manchester City,Yes,jb1zofi,t1_jb1nhg0
Npc 😂,Manchester City,Yes,jazm232,t1_jazli06
150m on Jude when they need a backup RB/CB and replace the likes of Keita/Ox/Milner won't end well.,Manchester City,Yes,jb2sl9s,t1_jb2s12u
"You are right. Fuckkkkk

https://preview.redd.it/09383j1g12ma1.jpeg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1a56f484a0f1ea259cadb1e439e1ecadcaee61d8",Manchester City,Yes,jb2ucdj,t1_jb2s12u
"Just a joke about Haaland going to Madrid, but not the one everyone expects. Because he was doing some top tier shit housing in yesterday's game like Atletico has engrained in them.

Not quite as obvious as I thought if it needed explaining perhaps. Stuck the /s on there so people would get the joke but no worries.",Manchester City,Yes,jazpj2e,t1_jazpasr
"Yeah but now that United have fallen behind I don’t want them to rescue anything. If they had taken the lead at Anfield and then bottled it then I’d be pleased with a draw


Am… am I too picky?",Manchester City,Yes,jb17ahm,t1_jb177mg
Yeah and that will be their one off day in their current resurgence. Fml.,Manchester City,Yes,jb1c5eu,t1_jb1bj4b
"You can also call them Arse-n-all, if you want. 

But I wanna bet that they’ll have an off day when they play Arsenal.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1ckkb,t1_jb1bgfd
That would be the most epic comeback. But I doubt they'll pull it off.,Manchester City,Yes,jb1qr4p,t1_jb1nad5
Yeah annoyingly might tip the Jude scale back over,Manchester City,Yes,jb19yb0,t1_jb19hzt
No FUCKIN way FORREAL?!? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,Manchester City,Yes,jb1ahrf,t1_jb1a8cr
Not at the moment but honestly i forgot about Diaz and Jota still there,Manchester City,Yes,jb1eone,t1_jb1dtyh
Oh yeah but I think buying a new FB would end up sounding like a club statement about the situation unless they release one before that or the whole thing is solved.,Manchester City,Yes,jb13jdv,t1_jb12qig
I do remember it and I'm seeing what Chelsea is doing to good players.,Manchester City,Yes,jb159k8,t1_jb1532z
"Grealish was one of the best players on the pitch, football is nit about g/a. His ball career, one twos were excellent. Also he is great on the ball very tough to get the ball from him and he is relatively strong guy",Manchester City,Yes,jazpj33,t1_jazlopo
"Foden's clutch too, but what I love is that Foden is capable of thriving with huge responsibility on a daily basis. Yesterday, first 30 minutes he was pretty much the driving force behind everything City did.",Manchester City,Yes,jazsnjy,t1_jazk7mx
"Actually, can someone look up the data for teams that get the most cards for dissent?",Manchester City,Yes,jb14y9k,t1_jb14ir8
"Exactly. 

Real madrid (especially in UCL) are masters at capitalizing counters and they always like to be dominated before showing reality to the other team. They enjoy their phase of being the underdog team and can never thrive with too much possession (example of how they struggle against heavy bus-parking La liga terrorist teams",Manchester City,Yes,jb1mx1l,t1_jb1bs59
"His mentality is unreal. I thought in the early days he was just one of those guys who was just happy to be at City, but it turned out he’s probably the hungriest and most ferocious winner of the bunch. His passion is infectious and I agree with you: he’s helped to galvanize that Arsenal dressing room to our detriment.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0lv4s,t1_jb0btx0
"Long term that’s a good take.

But if we lose the league by a couple points this season, you could absolutely make the claim selling Zinchenko to the winners was a pretty terrible decision in hindsight.",Manchester City,Yes,jb05kux,t1_jb04rsk
I don't know but what funnier is the game being played at St. James Park instead of Etihad. 🤣,Manchester City,Yes,jazoyfe,t1_jaznfe8
Right? My memory of actual games I've watched aren't this clear.,Manchester City,Yes,jazxzdg,t1_jaznfe8
I thought he was benched by Zinchenko because of tactical reasons. That means we don’t have many left back options to look into in the summer. At least I can’t think of any.,Manchester City,Yes,jb05dy4,t1_jazwyxz
"Lampard I agree, but Terry and Drogba were clearly not technical players. I mean Drogba was memed a lot in the sports newspapers back then for having a poor first touch, same as Haaland today. Terry was a very good all-round defender but he had to play with more technical players to bring a balance to the back line. He paired with Carvalho who was the technical player in his early days, and in the national team, Ferdinand who was clearly better on the ball than Terry. 

The closest you'll get to find a technical Mourinho team is his Madrid team but his teams at Chelsea, Inter, United, Tottenham and Roma show that Mourinho has always favored competitive and ""pashun"" type players over technical players. This City team is nothing close to a typical Mourinho team.",Manchester City,Yes,jazxn7k,t1_jazvisd
"We also still won the title, so it’s all good",Manchester City,Yes,jb1hk23,t1_jb1h17i
"yea but we play them at home, arsenal will have to deal with them at anfield, even if liverpool are truly back i feel like we can take care of them at the etihad, arsenal have the much tougher job having to play them at anfield. hopefully will be a nice 3 point swing in the table.",Manchester City,Yes,jb37w74,t1_jb1gnlw
[deleted],Manchester City,Yes,jb3783v,t1_jb1gnlw
"in all seriousness, though, the camaraderie he had with Jack there is the kind of thing that may keep him around",Manchester City,Yes,jb095dy,t1_jazpj2e
It's a tough one honestly. I love seeing United getting punked but don't want Liverpool getting top 4. United is the absolute worst for me... but I cannot take any joy with Liverpool doing anything positive.,Manchester City,Yes,jb17zov,t1_jb17ahm
"Not at the moment because Diaz is injured, but he was really good at the start of the season",Manchester City,Yes,jb1gg7x,t1_jb1eone
Ahhhh I forgor about that 💀,Manchester City,Yes,jb16il3,t1_jb159k8
"I meant to say he had an okay game and Almiron was just there to be fair. I don't judge Grealish by G/A. He was actually very important in the Bernardo goal but other than that wasn't really involved in the attacking phase of play like Foden. 

He also failed to track back and help Ake out defensively and Murphy exploited that and was just spamming crosses in, they should have scored from one of those if both Wilson and Joelinton didn't have a brain fart when the ball was at their feet.

Grealish didn't have a bad game but to say he was one of the best players on the pitch is stretching it for me.",Manchester City,Yes,jazqjak,t1_jazpj33
"It’s not a terrible decision if it’s part of a natural overhaul of the whole team that will ensure success in the next 5 or 10 years. Pep’s City is what it is (and Klopp’s Liverpool) because they have a long term plan and are not looking only for short term success,  Like United and Chelsea have been. Ultimately you can’t win the league every year.",Manchester City,Yes,jb06v7o,t1_jb05kux
"Not sure about that, can’t be a pretty terrible decision if the gap is just a few points. I love Zinny but he wasn’t exactly our best defender consistently, and the form Ake is in right now would’ve just meant more bench time for Zinny. There’s a reason he wanted to leave and we let him go. 

I think an extra goal in a couple of draws was what we needed to make up the difference this season. None of the three players were huge goal contributors in recent seasons. Jesus was only brilliant in patches and even Sterling never managed to regain pre-Lyon form consistently. I would blame the World Cup’s weird schedule for our gap more than missing Zinny or the others tbh.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0b4zg,t1_jb05kux
Your memory is great even though it remembers a shite dream like that.,Manchester City,Yes,jazut0b,t1_jazoyfe
Couldn't agree more. Especially if we can get a certain dorts player he is good friends with. He and grealish have a great bond. I mean everyone seems to love grealish but that grealish haaland Phil front 3 can get some real nice chemistry going,Manchester City,Yes,jb09tow,t1_jb095dy
Well it is still nice to watch the rags to get absolutely dunked on,Manchester City,Yes,jb18kol,t1_jb17zov
"Maybe but i feel like Nunez, Gakpo and Salah slowly finding their rhythm even if Diaz comeback he won't start ahead of these trio at the moment.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1hcp1,t1_jb1gg7x
"I think that’s looking too theoretical and granular. 

If Arsenal had to start and rely on Tierney all season then would be on at least 5+ less points by the end of the season. 

If we had Zinny as depth we may have gained 1 or 2 extra points over the whole season. 

He is a bigger difference for them than us.

That’s probably a potential 6 point swing on average to a title rival which is a huge difference if it’s the difference between winning the league or not. 

Absolutely not worth the transfer fee imo. Hindsight does help though. I’m sure no one at the club thought Arsenal would be challenging with it without Zinchenko.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0fos4,t1_jb0b4zg
"Fair, I would be surprised if he just came in and picked up from before. I’m thinking long term he’s better based on what we’ve seen.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1i46n,t1_jb1hcp1
"Not really, I think you’re making up scenarios to fit your theory. Arsenal would’ve just bought someone else. Everybody was crediting Jesus with their attack but they kept going even without him. 

Maybe they would’ve spent more to get someone? Maybe someone else would’ve stepped up? Maybe Zinny sitting on our bench would’ve been less sharp when brought on and actually cost us points from a mistake? 

A lot more moving parts with your scenario than mine, which is that slightly better finishing in key matches is what we have really needed so far. It’s all a moot point though, we’ll only know by the end of the season for sure. If we do win we won’t care about Zinny or anyone else leaving, and if we lose then people will blame everything from Ederson to selling Zinny to Pep’s tactics.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0h099,t1_jb0fos4
"There is literally no way to know how Arsenal would be doing with Tierney or us with Zinny. Fabian Delph won two titles with us while playing as a left back. Leicester won the title with relative nobodies. Liverpool added four exceptional players and are barely going to scrape 4th, if they get there at all. No use talking hypotheticals as fact when he have no idea what could have been.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0ig0o,t1_jb0fos4
"Maybe. I think it is quite simple though. 

Zinchenko has been absolutely essential for them and they way they play.

He would have been useful for us. 

That translates to some points over a season.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0imh4,t1_jb0h099
"If there is no way to know then what it the point in 99% of all football discussion? 

I think it’s incredibly likely that one of their most important players this season has indeed helped them.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0iu94,t1_jb0ig0o
"Kind of, he played for them around the same time as Cancelo’s played for us this season (both 3 G/A). I think there are other players like Saka, Odegaard, or Saliba that were more essential.

It makes me realised that once pep leaves its hard imagine what would happen to us, this sense of security we often taken for granted under pep that no matter what happens, we would still be at the top would be gone, the future would be very uncertain.

He obviously wants to stay in Barcelona, he had the chance to go to United under Ten Hag and didn't like the place.

His loyalty got tested and he was unjustly treated by a select few members of the upper echelon. He kept his head down and endured. No way the barcelona fans don't worship him at the moment.

I completely see why the journos and publications do this though, it's just free clicks.

I think Dias and Stones are pretty locked on to stay unless something unexpected comes up. Akanji likely stays because he just came and he’s gotten good playing time. 

Which leaves Ake and Laporte which I think at least 1 of them will want to leave. IMO I think Laporte would leave because he wants to be a regular starting every game possible. They are both 28 and have been our best CBs at times, I just hope both don’t leave. 

Which leaves the fullbacks. Rico I think should be the starting RB next year no questions, unless his play really drops off this year. Ake could be the option at LB but I’m not sure what the plans would be?

It's all set up for an Etihad heartbreak where we don't turn up and Leipzig play decent. 

They pose a huge threat on the counter ofc, and if they score the first goal or we show up not at it, they can easily capitalise. They have nothing to prove, we have everything to prove and need to have a good performance if we're to advance. Imagine Leipzig getting the 1st goal and how that might rattle the fans and players.

Hasn’t Lavia been in and out of the side after Hassenhuttl got sacked?,Manchester City,Yes,jamgr1e,t1_jamgihb
And it works out most of the time too lol,Manchester City,Yes,japgdaq,t1_japah2z
City xtra Instagram,Manchester City,Yes,jamcs9h,t1_jamcib0
Wouldn't he be back up to Partey if Arsenal wanted him.,Manchester City,Yes,jan0a9t,t1_jamv7y3
He can start with him. Perfectly capable to play as a deeper 8. Would make sense if Bernardo or gundo leave.,Manchester City,Yes,jan831u,t1_jam6gbi
"we'd be strengthening our rivals by a lot then, pep has to find a way to manage his minutes",Manchester City,Yes,jan1awv,t1_jam6gbi

"Bellingham or Sane, don't care too much about rice",Manchester City,Yes,jamuffz,t1_jamu5i0
Sabe LW with Foden RW would absolutely demolish PL. 50 goals for Haaland,Manchester City,Yes,jaohfob,t1_jamu5i0
I fear what want Cancelo will be sold for. It’s going to be shockingly low,Manchester City,Yes,jaoniai,t1_jaon7th
"His ball playing is huge. 

I think he would be looked at much more favorably if his biggest mistakes weren’t in big games and he takes Stones spot.",Manchester City,Yes,jaowtxb,t1_jaoutgk
"Walker is 32 going on 33 and I think he is already losing his edge (as expected). He’s not a good enough defender to be starting if he doesn’t have his pace imo and I fear it’ll be any day now he loses his pace. The consistency of his performances has really dropped off. 

I love him but I think Rico is coming through at the perfect time.",Manchester City,Yes,jaowmhp,t1_jaoswpz
"Fair point, think the agent is tryna drum up interest, and Barca could do with a lw (they could do with some better finances too tbf). Was just interested that the agent had come out and said it. Plus in no rush to move feel like we aren't touching either of them",Manchester City,Yes,jam1ndo,t1_jam17yr
Yes and I don't how Liverpool can buy defender instead of midfielder,Manchester City,Yes,jam8p6m,t1_jam17yr
To piss off Thiago Silva,Manchester City,Yes,jano78w,t1_jankea6
World Cup winner,Manchester City,Yes,janlh9e,t1_jankea6
he started their last 7 PL matches and missed a couple of months at the start of the season with a hamstring injury,Manchester City,Yes,jamhs8n,t1_jamgr1e
KFC tier then,Manchester City,Yes,jaml8av,t1_jamcs9h
for like a year or two.. but Partay is almost 30 and very injury prone,Manchester City,Yes,jaokyuz,t1_jan0a9t
Why try to force him in when there are other options? He’s good but he’s not at Gundo or Bernardo’s level. Would we be this desperate to get him if he wasn’t at City before?,Manchester City,Yes,janaaag,t1_jan831u
Lol no,Manchester City,Yes,jan3pdg,t1_jan1awv
I heard Cancelo has been playing well at bayern,Manchester City,Yes,jap1s4j,t1_jaoniai
I expect the amount to be around 40-45m. Tbh we don't really need to sell our players to their maximum value for our signings. Our club doesn't operate like that.,Manchester City,Yes,jaonvrp,t1_jaoniai
"It’s fine, see Chelsea. We will spend and amortise it all.",Manchester City,Yes,japledy,t1_jaoniai
"Sure I'm just saying that might be another problem we have in the back line that if he does drop off like that and pushes to leave, we may need to buy another RB *as well*",Manchester City,Yes,jap8swo,t1_jaowmhp
This i can get behind,Manchester City,Yes,janoax3,t1_jano78w
Fair enough. I just heard that he didn’t see eye to eye with Nathan Jones and he was in and out of the XI,Manchester City,Yes,jamhyri,t1_jamhs8n
"It is reported by Bild in Germany, City Xtra are just aggregators they share the news.",Manchester City,Yes,jamrldg,t1_jaml8av
The thing about kfc is that it tastes great but it destroys my insides so…,Manchester City,Yes,janzq2v,t1_jaml8av
"How is it forcing him there when he's played there before?

And there is practically nobody at those two's level, but this is an elite level talent we're talking about. Elite defensive reading, a dribbling ability to keep the ball at a high level that not many young prospects like him possess. I would take him in a heartbeat because he's just that good.

And I feel like City are going to evolve into a double pivot side with all the names thrown around and he'd be PERFECT there.",Manchester City,Yes,janbu1b,t1_janaaag
"That’s true but if they sold him for 30m I wouldn’t be shocked. 

Honestly my dream is a Cancelo and Sane swap.",Manchester City,Yes,jaoob5u,t1_jaonvrp
"Oh yeah 100%, I’m not even sure what they would do then. If everyone stayed I could see Pep putting Stones on the right more",Manchester City,Yes,jap9x7u,t1_jap8swo
We wouldn’t have let him go if he was at the level you think he is tbh. We keep going through this every year. We let go players and this sub claims we made a mistake because they would be perfect  for us. Then a season later it turns out they weren’t that good. Rinse and repeat.,Manchester City,Yes,jane7v0,t1_janbu1b
"I thought about that too but we would be getting robbed in that deal lol. I love sane to death but he's not really the same player that we had before. He has lost his pace but his technical quality is good tho, so for a good price i will be happy with signing him.",Manchester City,Yes,jaooqbp,t1_jaoob5u
Yeah Stones is good in that role. Akanji too maybe.,Manchester City,Yes,japt3na,t1_jap9x7u
"Mistakes can always be made. Always maintained he's elite.

Just watch Southampton, guy is a level above everyone and he's 18! That itself should tell you.

I've never been particularly annoyed or upset over loaning or selling players, but Lavia is that guy.",Manchester City,Yes,janhhaz,t1_jane7v0
"How many times has the club been wrong about letting a player go though? I just don’t see him as a starter for us, at best second choice and he doesn’t want that.",Manchester City,Yes,janjalw,t1_janhhaz
"Very rarely, but why not believe that it can happen?

I wouldn't even bluff because you don't see many versatile 6s like him. Pep rated him too, which is why we saw him train with the first team so young. Think he'll be around till next season. Once he's developed a bit more, pull the trigger and get him to play in that potential double pivot.

De Bruyne, Foden, Rodri, Lavia, potentially Bellingham... Mad cohort.

And we're linked to Rice so it does seem like Pep wants that double pivot, so while we're at it I'd take Lavia over him because price. Rice is good too.",Manchester City,Yes,janp4lq,t1_janjalw
"I don’t believe it will happen because I don’t rate him at the level of Rodri, KDB, Gundo, Bernardo, David Silva, Dinho etc. Think about all the midfielders we’ve had over the years. Really think about how great they have been. I’m talking players who not only started for City in the UCL but also in the World Cup for their national teams. Lavia is good but he’s not at that level.

Let’s see how things work out for him but I just don’t think that’s likely. Also, I wouldn’t put much stock in these transfer rumours since they’re rarely accurate. It wouldn’t be shocking if none of the clubs mentioned go for him.",Manchester City,Yes,janrshp,t1_janp4lq
"Have you watched Lavia? Ridiculous to think about whether he at their level, because his career has only just started.


Anyway, he's only 18 but his profile, pass selection, calmness under pressure etc. for that age are mad, no doubt he's going to be world class in his prime. Hard to be a standout in a team as a 6 and technically far above the rest at 18.",Manchester City,Yes,jaouepq,t1_janrshp
"I have seen him, and the way you’re describing him makes me wonder if you have tbh. No offense but you’re being a bit over the top.",Manchester City,Yes,jape8l9,t1_jaouepq
Nope I'm not. Rarely do I gush over young players. It's just that I do rate him that highly. Rare to find a 6 like him.,Manchester City,Yes,japhhee,t1_jape8l9

Feel like our winger signing (assuming we got one) will come as a surprise to everyone. No links to anyone yet really. But kvara seems impossible to get and doubt Napoli would want to move him on.

That's the kind of stuff you debate when you lose 2-0.

"I previously praised Ten Hag for playing Weghorst as a 10 and Bruno out wide, but that decision only made sense as a temporary solution in the absence of Antony. 

Bruno always looks so limited when he’s deployed as a winger. For Ten Hag to play him off the left this time around, against Trent mind you, felt like a really poor decision. 

I generally believe Bruno is too overprotected. He’s been really poor the last few games and tbh he’s probably exhausted. Also not a fan of his petulant behaviour on the pitch which is why I’ve never quite favoured him as the captain.

Ultimately a lot went wrong yesterday and everyone is to blame. This is probably the only time I’ve ever criticized this manager which is quite incredible.",Manchester United,No,jb4lfcu,t3_11jiacj

He wasn’t the reason we lost of course but we are 3-0 down at an hour mark. Scott comes on the field at 60 minutes. We ship 4 more goals in 30 minutes of play. 

He cannot be trusted in any situation. Last time he started in midfield he was yanked off at halftime for Casemiro and it was against much lower quality opposition. 

I thought a strong, big lad from the academy would at least push some people around. All he does is get stupid yellow cards and gets skipped past by agile and fast players. Every game. His only attribute is being tall on set pieces (defensive ones, on attacking ones he’s useless too).

"4-0 against Everton. 6-3 against City. 5-0 against Pool. 7-0 today. 4-0 vs Brentford. 4-1 Watford. 6-1 Spurs. Fred and DDG played in all of those. Plenty of other examples over the last 3-4 years. Villa. Watford. Spurs. It keeps happening because we position ourselves poorly as a club. 

How much of the depth would you trust? Jones, Bailly, Lindelof, McTominay, Martial, Telles, Williams, Tuanzebe, Donny and Elanga aren't good enough. Neither of our starting right backs are good enough. Eth has done a great job in making the deadwood serviceable, but we have players who literally aren't fit to wear the shirt. Garnacho showed more fight today than half of the team combined. 

Let's compare to City. They've moved on Sterling, Jesus, Aguero, Sane, David Silva,  Otamendi, Garcia, Torres, Fernandinho, Bravo, Cancelo. Players like Foden coming through the ranks and they still brought in Grealish, Haaland, Alvarez etc. 

Culture of failure is endemic. Glazers out. At least ten of those players out in the summer. Five really good signings plus Sabitzer and Wout for depth.

"Some personnel don't belong and they'll change so no point discussing that. Got a few other issues though.

1.	Bruno's behaviour was shocking yet not surprising. You need the captain to step up when you're losing. Every team looks good when winning. I think he'll become the captain next season but he needs to work on himself. Can't be behaving like a petulant child.
2.	Players lost discipline right after 2-0. That's just unacceptable. Shit happens. You concede early in the second half sometimes it's okay. Just keep your heads. Need to work on mental composure of the entire team.
3.	We desperately need another midfielder to control games. Somebody to slow or increase the pace of the game when we need it. We don't have anybody to dictate games in there and it hurts us. 
4.	Not unleashing Rashy on TAA was a very poor decision from EtH. So were his subs. Poor day for him.
5.	Train these players over the summer on how to pass under a press. Too many mistakes all the time. Not enough players good enough to play out of a press. Never gonna become a big team unless we can do that.",Manchester United,No,jb4b28e,t3_11jiacj

He can’t beat his man, his passing/crossing are mediocre, and his lack of right foot makes him very predictable.

Not when everything is nice and dandy, but now - when morale is at an all time low. And I have every bit of faith in ETH. I'm sure you do as well. ✔
* I don't know when **winning** the PL got within the fan's crosshair. Again, got ahead of ourselves. From the absolute mess we were last season, we had to stick to our goal - Top 4. And we are 3rd right now on the table with one game to go. GOOD SPOT to be in. ✔
* We won the Carabao cup. Does this game completely eradicates the progress the ETH has made since taking over? NO. ✔
* We are still in the FA and Europa cup. Lets use this as a lesson to stay grounded. This game will teach us to respect our opponents despite our impeccable form. Lets get them. ✔

I wonder if there's any that showed EtH they don't have a long term future at this club. Their attitude, mentality, and application stunk in the second half.

For me, Dalot has been wank since coming back from the World Cup. An absolute liability today. Also showed how badly we need a proper number 9 today. Weghorst has heart but he's seriously lacking.

The fundamental balance in the team is still missing, and a lot of our players still make absolutely brain dead decisions instead of putting pressure on the other team by controlling possession.

I doubt Ten Hag is happy about this, and I want wholesale changes in the approach in the rest of the matches forward.

Some teams have unofficial rules where players let their PR teams run their socials completely due to the effect social media can have on their performance and moods and to maximise brand deals / avoiding saying random stupid shit.

There are no scapegoats this time around for the united twitterati to blame (Maguire, mcfred etc). 

One silver lining if you can call it that is that these are major flaws that need ironing out in the coming seasons if EtH wants his side to challenge, and these losses conceding so many goals will be something to ponder.

If we won the league we clearly would be overachieving, which would put way too much pressure onto next season (in terms of speculation, pressure to bring in players, etc). The development of this side needs to be progressive to be able to be consistent mentally playing at the highest level. Last night was a clear display that we don't have that tough mental consistency yet (some say perhaps a game too far with how many played, but that's hard to say).

Don't judge the team based off of one terrible result, because the 30+ other games weve played so far this season is a much better representation of where we are at. I care more about how we bounce back from this, and so far this season we have responded well after a loss.

Now it looks like Casemiro is injured and we'll still have to wait to see how they get on together.

I don't know why you would start Dalot over AWB in a game like this. Sancho should have come on, Rashford was isolated and he could have opened up space Antony wasn't. Prefer Wout in the role he's been playing before, if he's on the pitch Rashford should be on the left, not up top. It works well to take him off for Garnacho and let Rashford end the game as the striker, I'm not sure what ETH intended with the different Werghorst role.

This is Ten Hag’s biggest challenge imo. To get these players to give 120% on the pitch, not on days when we’re comfortably winning, but on days when we need the fight.

Honestly? I’m glad it happened now in an inconsequential game (we’re still third) than happening say in a cup game or a game where we had to fight for top four or summin.

What I will say though, is it was a total freak match for most of this season to date. Everything went right for their previously non-clinical players (Nunez, Gakpo) and nothing went right for any of our players.

I don't like seeing everyone throwing their toys out of the pram today though. Yes, there are still signs of a worrying mentality in this team, in that when we lose, we lose big and fold. However, there have been a number of matches where that also wasn't the case and we have managed to come back and draw or win.

I'm of the opinion that ETH has shown he is good enough this season to have the faith of you all to bounce back over the next few matches. There is absolutely no point in going into total panic mode over this season because of one pathetic showing, especially when the previous 19 matches in the last 10 weeks have seen us win 15, draw 3 and lose just once (beating Barca and City in the same time-frame and winning our first trophy in 6 years).

Compare that with the 13 games  liverpool played in the same period, that's a third of what our boys have been through. It may not seem like a significant number but I think it does take a toil on the human mind and body at a top level.
Our buys need better mental fortitude and a some testicular ones too. The way they gave up after the 3rd and 4th goal was embarrassing.
That said, let's hope this humbling experience remind our boys that they have accomplished nothing yet. They maybe getting near the top again but they could always come crashing down if they slip up just one bit.

In the razor's-edge system ETH has us playing, where a single mistake can unravel an entire sequence... it's a recipe for disaster. 

I'm not excusing Bruno's behaviour, but he acted almost literally the same as a toddler who needs a nap. His decision-making circuits looked fried. Burnout saps you of your willpower and fine judgement, letting emotion take the reins. I sympathise, but I wish he would have dealt with it better. He's overplayed and the club need to realise that. 

Responsibility for the massive loss? I think it's shared between the manager, the players, the chances of fate (Liverpool's insane chance conversion rate), the calendar ('suffering from success') , a little bit of everything.

But if we go and win the next few games I’m willing to put this down as a one off horror show. But something has to be done about this tendency to ship huge amounts of goals as soon as the opponent picks up a good head of steam. This can’t happen again, against Liverpool or against anyone.

"It was a statistical outlier of a game, two teams at the top or bottom end of the table can face each other a thousand times without ever reproducing this result again. Everything they hit went in.  


Plus our players played low quality attacks (minus Barca, who had injured players) for a period of time. Arsenal are still not in the same league and City had just 1 on target while trying to walk it in. This Liverpool is the most lethal frontline we have faced since the WC let's be real. Our players have been somewhat complacent at times and getting away with it recently, letting attackers take potshots knowing nothing would happen, add to that the tiredness and loss in concentration after too many midweek games. We have seen players getting tired after 40 minutes in the Carabao. 

We simply do not have depth to catch City. I hope Eth takes a very practical approach. We have just enough for a comfortable 3rd place finish. City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Spurs have to play one another bar a few here and there. There will be dropped points. We still have a couple arguably difficult games at St James's Park and Amex.

So rest, relax, rotate, reprioritize and be smart in picking games. We can still get away with 2 more trophies this season.",Manchester United,No,jb3sdgd,t3_11jiacj
"I'll say this again, I might not be a long time fan... but it seems like a lot of people are just dropping support for the players with a result like this. Fans are supposed to support the players even with a bad result, otherwise you won't have a team bouncing back with no one routing for them.

The match was a disaster, that's for certain. Beyond a disaster considering the beating handed to us by our biggest rivals. This result was because of all 11 players falling short but they're not going to on if the fans can't at least show some support going forward.

It's also worth mentioning, we're still in 3 competitions, have a trophy and are higher than liverpool in the PL. It could be a lot worse, dare I say some people needed a reality check.",Manchester United,No,jb4174q,t3_11jiacj
"Haven’t seen any apology posts yet except for De Gea’s?

I can see parallels between Erik & Ole’s mistakes of not keeping the squad fresh, trying to go for all 4 fronts with a squad not capable for it and then falling short when it matters. ETH got lucky with Carabao fixtures and tbf Ole got lucky with Europa to reach the finals.

We seriously need to stop playing the same people every game. Bruno has played every game apart from when he was suspended. Rashford has almost started played in every game since WC. There are a few more. You are simply running these players to the ground. 

Rotate and give opportunities to the squad or just let it go. Ole tried it the next season and got knocked out of FA & Carabao almost immediately. We had so many games in the last two months and a lot more coming up. This is pretty much the issue with Liverpool, Chelsea and almost every squad except City. No one can consistently compete for all trophies every season until you have an amazing squad and we need to be realistic about that cause even if we win everything this season, we will crash and burn the next.

So, start rotating and if we cannot win against Southampton and other teams from the bottom part of the table without our regular starters, then we need to clear out the bench.",Manchester United,No,jb43sic,t3_11jiacj

People ask to strip Bruno for captaincy, Antony to be put on the bench and so on and so one..this is the same Captain that gave us the EFL  CUP , and the same Antony that scored against Barca, to get us through to the next round. 

And this might sound a bit strange, however I am glad we lost 7-0 rather than 1-0 or 2-0..cuz this will be a wake up call, and the players are wounded and will bounce back!",Manchester United,No,jb44vdz,t3_11jiacj

"Players giving up need to be fixed, especially after 2 or 3 goals. Think ETH should have set up to defend deeper like against Arsenal and hit liverpool on the counter rather than try to play an open game. Even in the first half, Gakpo, Nunez and Salah were creating chances easily.   
Just some really good last ditch defending prevented them from converting them. If not from the beginning, they really should have started defending deeper after the third goal and, once you gain possession, tried to keep the ball longer in buildups rather than doing whatever the hell they were doing going forward when they got the chance.

"The second half was a disaster as the players just gave up 10 minutes into it. Don’t really want talk about it, trust that ETH will fix that attitude. 

But our plan wasn’t good. We were playing fast attacks in transition with Bruno and Antony as wingers and Weghorst as CAM. While Wout was fine, we all know Bruno would perform way better from this spot, and Bruno himself isn’t a pacy winger who’s strong 1x1 to target TAA. So is Antony, if he has the ball in a counter attack, you know he will slow down and let the defender catch him. 

So the question is, do you think Weghorst performance justifies the fact we had to sacrifice Bruno and bench one of Sancho/Garnacho? I’d say fuck no. If we can’t score with him as CF, when the plan is to play counterattacks/fast transition, he should stay on the bench. ETH clearly favors him for the work ethic, but from technical point view he can’t produce even 25% of what Sancho/Garnacho can give us. We can’t always rely on Marcus to bail us out. 

Same but to lesser extent applies to Antony. He has a way bigger margin for mediocre performances than Jadon. Shouldn’t start unless we’re going to dominate in possession.",Manchester United,No,jb4d3j2,t3_11jiacj

Put Sabitzer on for Weghorst and move bruno to f9 and Rashford to the left. Crowd the midfield so that they would not have time and space to bring their front 3 into the game. This is how Newcastle managed to be in the front foot after going a man down against these lot.

We need to build on top of that of course (striker is the biggest obvious gap right now) but the winning mentality, discipline to stick to tactics and also removing lapses of concentration is what we need most - on top of having the patience with the Man Utd staff to instill that.

Seeing Rashford hit form, Weghorst being a nuisance, Dalot/ AWB stopping us from looking at RB options, Varane/ Licha being great has been a pleasure to watch in the past months, they are living up to the promise. Let's keep supporting them.

I'm also not sure it's as clear cut as people make out that AWB should have played instead of Dalot. Yes, Wan-Bissaka is in better form and Dalot like many others had a poor game.

I can't even really get mad at some of the worst offenders yesterday because they've been amongst our best players recently, Licha, Luke, Case, Bruno, Rapha. 

Too painful to even do a full post-mortem on that but ETH had possibly his worst game, well definitely worst since the Brentford debacle. On current form AWB should definitely have started over DD, we really missed his tracking, tough tackling and aggression. He would have got under Nunez's skin just by beasting him. It wasn't a game for Wout at all, he may have his uses in games we dominate but he was lost here. To play Rashy up front against VVD and Konate when Trent has been struggling massively and was the obvious target off the left.  Such a blatant missed opportunity. We've had success against Liverpool before this season thanks to the work rate of Elanga helping out shutting down their overlapping full-backs, unfortunately Antony did nothing of the sort today, he actually looked physically intimidated coming up against Van Dijk a few times and even Milner at one stage.

Rashford stops running, 

Fernandes starts complaining and diving, 

McTominay starts clattering into people and getting yellows, 

Shaw turns into drunk Buttner, 

Fred gets even more crazy and less strategic with his running, 

De Gea retreats further and further into the goal to the point he’s standing inside of it

"18 games played by us to date in 2023, compared to 13 by Liverpool to date. While I do not condone the complete surrender that occurred yesterday, I think fatigue finally caught up with us, along with a combination of tactics employed sunday and lack of quality depth. Right now, our squad players aren't trusted by Erik to see matches out, as once again shown in the FA cup match. A common pattern has been to thrown on starters to see matches out when attempting to give some much needed rest. The squad isn't deep enough for 4 competitions, which makes the body of work put together by the boss to date even all the more impressive. 

2 losses in our 21 total matches since the campaign resumed, all things considered, the rebuild is on track, but this squad is not the finished product.

I wouldn't be too worried about the result yesterday. I'd argue that before coming into this game there was no more 'in form team' than Man Utd. I watched some games with some beautiful football on show, it really felt like everything was going right for once.

Obviously the result was criminally embarrassing but the best thing about the premier league is that it's just one game and you can move on to the next. In terms of points (which is all that matters at this point of the season) the next game is worth just as much.

"Tbh 

I saw a heavy defeat coming, Newcastle and West Ham gave us hard games and Barca too but all 3 are not that great at the mo abd we just beat them.

We have literally played 2 to 3 games a week since the world cup and its showing and literally 4 of our players yesterday didnt look fit or had to pass fitness tests

Shaw Varane and another all had late tests tbh I think we shouldnt have played them. Maybe have played Malacia and AWB

ETH got it wrong yesterday and he knows it, dalot should not play now after that AWB should abd AWB would have neutralised alot of that wing.

Antony needs to be taught to track back and also to stay on his side of the field so many tines the last 4 matches ive seen him in the middle of the pitch your a winger mate.

Hopefully its a blip, today they are fucked and will porbably go through the hardest training session known to man.

We were never going for the title this year and some of our players gave up after seeing Arsenal and City win again.

Its shit we lost that way it really is but i pointed it out today.

Even in Sir Alexs golden years we got beat bad some times by Liverpool, City, Newcastle and for thr love of god we lost to Southampton 6-3.

To this day I am still more ashamed of the Newcastle and Southampton games, but this match does equal it.

Also this is not a moan, Liverpool spent money in the Jan window we had to loan.

THE sale has to go through now. Regardless of SJR or Qataris we need money investing into the team and its showing we need more good/better squad players

Also people need to be Sold, to me thats the nail in the coffin of Scott Mctominay, hes not Utd level never has been.

Dalot love the guy but since the world cup AWB has been the better player.

Fred has been immense but we saw the bad side yesterday, ETH really needs to start Betis with Casemiro and Sabizter 

Varane cannot play every game and it is showing now, he needs a rest same with Casemiro.

"I remember Jose in one of his lower key press conferences (and I think he was having a sideways dig at Pogba at the time as he'd just dropped him for McTominay) said he doesn't expect his players to be 10 out of 10s every week or even most weeks, but there is a minimum standard, where you have to at least do the basics so that you are walking off the field at worst a 6 out of 10 and not dropping all the way down to a 1 or 2 out of 10.

Shocking how many players were a 1/10 today.  Varane, Casemiro, Shaw, Licha, McTominay (when he came on), Bruno...  Some of those you really wouldn't expect it, others are walking on thin ice. 

DDG 1/10.  Even on a good day this man literally never does the basics.  Never has done. If he's not stopping shots he is a waste of space.  Like Pogba, pulls the wool over so many people's eyes, but not good enough.

Dalot, these 1/10s happens far too frequently with him.  Still young, but we need someone better.  

Fred, I dunno what to say.  His only redeeming quality is he works hard, and I respect that, I really do, but not good enough.  

As for Varane and Shaw, for experienced pros I expect so much more, and these aren't their first shockers so both walking on thin fucking ice if you ask me.  

Everyone else diabolical.  But I will give Bruno, Rashford, Licha and Casemiro a little bit of a break as they have been otherwise very, very, very good this season.

"Wall of text incoming but I was being very angry with Antony specifically yesterday and after re-watching the goals today I got even angrier. He had a particular bad day yesterday:

1st goal: [https://dubz.co/video/9228d1](https://dubz.co/video/9228d1)

Watch Antony, the man was just watching our right wing getting completely exposed and didn't even attempt to jog back.

3rd goal: [https://dubz.co/video/2b356bAntony](https://dubz.co/video/2b356bAntony) fails to keep the player from advancing and after that he isn't even in the shot for the remaining of the video.

4th goal: [https://dubz.co/video/5cf3df](https://dubz.co/video/5cf3df)

Antony loses the ball and just lifts his arms and stays put. Doesn't even attempt to run back

6th goal; [https://dubz.co/video/34fdfd](https://dubz.co/video/34fdfd)

Where the fuck is Antony? Our right wing was completely exposed

7th goal: [https://dubz.co/video/a0c3cb](https://dubz.co/video/a0c3cb)

Watch Antony, he was past the half way line when the goal was scored.

"When Fergie went up against Wenger, we battered them several times.  They never battered us though.  Why?  Everyone knew the reason why.  Because we had a backbone and they didn't.  They didn't have that resilience when things went against them which is why they took many batterings from us, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, City etc and they lost to Chelsea every time they showed up. 

Recently we've been in the same position, taking many batterings because we don't have a backbone.  I thought maybe things were changing, but we've had a lot of false dawns since Fergie retired, and I'm still wary this might be another one.  The mentality of the team in the 2nd half was there in full show for everyone to see.  Team still needs open heart surgery, we have a scouting department that aren't fit for purpose, club run by buffoons, still rotten from top to bottom.

Then we have the prospect of the Qatari's coming in, maybe they pump obscene amounts of money in, but even if you can look the other way any victory will feel hollow, not earned, or the club gets saddled with massive debts and we're in the same predicament we're in now.

Today had ETH not stuck with him for long,
had he played Bruno in the middle Rashy as 9 and Garnaocho on left with Weghorst subbed, I am pretty sure TAA would be taken for a ride by Garnacho.

Sabitzer for Fred, AWB for Dalot were the subs that could have changed the tide.

I don’t know why ETH only uses Sabitzer to relace Case at times, he is a very potent midfielder who can replace Fred as well.

Fred can be a good man marker, but it’s also easy to get him out of position. It’s one thing to man mark, it’s another to get pulled out completely from the midfield leading to wide spaces being open.
Antony, offers average going forward. Really average but somehow gets away with it. 
Weghorst in a midfield against world class players was going to be exposed eventually. 

It was bound to happen, these were going to be exposed anyway, but a 7-0 drubbing is almost unforgivable. The goal difference we struggled to raise for weeks has gone down the drain.

I looked at all Premier League games from this season and last, where a team were on the receiving end of an Xg of 2 or higher. We're the second worst underperformers in these games, conceding almost an extra goal per game than we should whenever our XgA is over 2.

However when we look at games where XgA is 2 or under. We're pretty average or even slightly overperforming.

"Now that I recall yesterday with clear head, the whole match felt like a dream, I usually feel the team's efforts and chances but after half time I went numb. It didn't feel right. 
But now I am optimistic again. I'm not an expert but I felt like Ten Hag is trying to change they way we play against big teams, usually considering the managers we've had we park the bus and play on counter and this game looked like trying to play open game (it worked against Barca) and I respect Ten Hag for that, yes we could've parked the bus because we know how to, but trying this way looks like the right thing to me. Ten Hag said we should bring back the real Manchester of old and I hope it's the step in that direction. Remember when teams were afraid when we were on the ball? That was almost a lifetime away, but it's gotta change, look at Arsenal, I know it's hard to admit but they even made City play from counter, they made City play without possession. Yes the result wasn't theirs, but Pep surely didnt like not having possession and playing his boring ball. I hope we're going in the direction where we control the game even against strongest opponents, where they are afraid when we're on the ball. 
Trust in Ten Hag and he needs full backing, yeah we've spent a lot but this is MU we can spend a lot more hopefully after the debt is cleared. 
P.S. Gakpo played really well, maybe Ten Hag also wanted to play him as 9, cause originally it was our main target for winter before Wout. So far all his desired players play fantastically. Gotta trust the bald man!",Manchester United,No,jb41bxj,t3_11jiacj
"I’m still feeling physically sick and woke up this morning thinking it was a nightmare. We have had a tremendous turn around and achieved some fantastic things in a short amount of time under this first season but yesterday puts a wet blanket over it all for me to be honest. 

There are a lot of positives and I have no doubt in my mind that EtH is the right manager and we will be successful under him. I was prepared to loose eventually considering our good run of form and the intensive schedule and I would even have accepted 2-0 or 3-0 against the scousers but 7-0 and a performance like that? Sickening. 

I hope the players were called in early this morning and the team spends the day rewatching the game multiple times because that is one of the worst matches I’ve seen as a United supporter. 

Some of the players really need to look at themselves because as EtH said that performance was unprofessional by players getting paid enormous amount of money to play football. Weghorst needs to be sent back after this season, I appreciate his work rate and all but he is a Championship caliber player. I also don’t get all the leniency in this sub towards Bruno, I love him and what he’s done for us but he has has a lot of games where he is poor. Just moping around and complaining and diving every chance he gets. His behavior yesterday was appalling, you are the captain of United and when the going gets tough it’s time to lead and he did not even remotely do that yesterday.

"New day and after I watched rewatch the game, I'm actually even more furious at the players. First half we performed well enough despite a goal down and I expected them to be more fired up and battle until the last whistle like they had shown post-World Cup. Except they didn't do that, they didn't do ANY of that. Instead we let our heads after a terrible start and just gave up. Liverpool keep parting our defence like the Red Sea and what's worse is they didn't try to break us down, we let them have the freedom of Anfield to do whatever they want. We made Gakpo and Nunez look like the second coming of Yorke and Cole and Salah once again own us with yet another time of his life against us.

I thought we stopped that bullshit but yesterday show there's still a lot of work ahead of us. Ten Hag got the the lineup wrong but what can he do when his players give up FIVE MINUTES into the second half? Some of the players exposed themselves as untrustworthy and embarrassed the fans, the manager and everything what Manchester United are about in that shambolic display. I don't wanna Werghost in a 10 role or Rashford upfront again. Dalot and Shaw are a sorry excuses for footballers, I'm convinced had AWB and Malacia started, we have still lost but with dignity and courage unlike these cowards who left our centre backs on No Man's Land. Less said about Bruno, the better. We need a captain who can rally his troops in the face of adversity and overcome the odds like Keane, Vidic, and Cantona not the type who throw his toy out of the pram like a petulant child. Our best player for three years straight but way too emotional and hormonal when the going gets tough.

Let's hope this was a one off and just a really bad day at the office. Such a result can affect the rest of the season which we can't afford to when we are still fighting for two remaining trophies. Ten Hag better get ruthless and whip them back into shape and demand the players to never perform like that again because this is by far the worst ever match in our history and to our most hated rivals nonetheless.

"Fair play to those who can move on from that result, 24 hours later and I remain completely disgusted. This one has really shaken me and my perception of the progress we've made. Not that I've written it off or anything, just it's put an obvious dent in it.

The collapse at 2-0 was just unbelievable, possibly the worst half of football I've ever seen. Ten Hag got so much wrong and deserves his share of culpability. I think that's what has shocked me most because the guy knows football, knows tactics and has had a really good first season in charge. Player wise, everyone embarrassed themselves. Some, like Antony, haven't really impressed me this season but I can accept it's his first season in a new league. Doesn't make the performance acceptable but I'm happy to give him time. Others have been at the club too long. I think for some that sort of vulnerable mentality will take too much effort to coach out, and of course the question about whether some really are good enough to play for Man Utd. Even those who've had a decent season were badly exposed yesterday.

Regardless of the outcome of this season, this one takes the shine of it significantly for me. It's worse that it came at Anfield, but our worst result in a century and tied worst ever loss regardless of who it came against is a terrible blight on the season and I hope will trigger some very serious considerations about who has the mettle to be at Old Trafford next season. Mentality is a hard thing to build and there are some who I suspect are very vulnerable in that side that, when it really comes to crunch time, will let us down.

So, yes, let's put things into perspective, shall we?

When I was a kid, I used to collect sticker albums and had several football annual year books.  Under each team, it would tell you their honours, the capacity of the stadium, who the secretary of the club was and all that kinda shit.  And do you know what else was listed?  Our record ever victory (for those who paid attention to that kinda thing you'll know it was 10-0 v Anderlecht when the Busby Babes played in the first round of the European Cup in 1956/57).  I wasn't born then, but records like that should be a source of pride for every United fan no matter what year you were born, particularly knowing what happened to that team 18 months later. 

But do you know what else was listed in these annual year books?  Our record ever defeat.  

That defeat against Liverpool is going to be permanently etched into the history books now.  That should be a source of shame for every United player that took part.  In the bit next to honours it will say, League Cup winners (1992, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2017, 2023).  And in the record defeat section it will say: 5th March 2023 Liverpool 7-0 Manchester United.  

Essentially the defeat is going to take up more real estate space in the record books than winning that silver trinket last Sunday.  Kids who are not even born yet will know about what happened yesterday. 

Everyone who took part yesterday has a permanent black mark next to their name. 
You let our most hated rivals do that to us.  You gave up.  It doesn't get worse than that.  In the olden days they used to put people in stocks and throw rotten eggs at them.  I'm starting to think they had the right idea. If we can celebrate them then why not?  If we can give DDG a ridiculous presentation for doing his job (and I wouldn't mind if he actually did his job, you know the basics like catching a fucking cross or coming out to sweep or passing it to someone who actually plays on the same team now and again) then why shouldn't they get the opposite?

And don't tell me you are sorry, I've heard it all before and it's just words, how about giving your wages back to the community, or volunteering your spare time this week to doing something meaningful?

"I saw many theories on what went wrong yesterday. From De Gea being outdated to Antony being shit, Bruno losing his head, our defenders having a stinker, our squad having a loser mentality,...

All of that is true to an extent. However, to me, the issue is exactly what has been plaguing us for YEARS and it's our midfield. Casemiro is obviously a world class DM but he seemed to be carrying an injury so he couldn't really cover ground. Combine that with Fred being half a midfielder even at his best because of his lack of defensive positioning and him running around like a headless chicken and you get a recipe for a disaster.

I'd argue we seemed the more dangerous side in the first half before we conceded but all was still fine. The issue came in second half when everyone lost their heads because injured Casemiro and Fred running around aimlessly meant we had zero midfield presence so literally any counter-attack Liverpool had resulted in them directly taking on our defenders. That's exactly what made us so shit last year, Fred-McTominay were always so non-existent that pretty much any ball through our midfield resulted in Maguire, Lindelöf and others getting exposed to 1v1s or 2v1s. Of course, the defenders sometimes win the ball, but no defender ever is going to be able to defend well with no midfield cover in front of him.

The solution? Not a massive clear-out, but a continuation of our midfield revamp. Casemiro is an amazing player and Eriksen is great, but Fred and especially McTominay don't have what it takes.

My question to Ten Hag would be why Sabitzer didn't start instead of Fred, especially if Casemiro wasn't at his best and Fred is known for being erratic. Yesterday's 0-7 and 2-2 against Leeds where we played Fred-Sabitzer showed us once again why Fred is hopeless in double pivot unless someone does the defensive job of two players at once.",Manchester United,No,jb4jab5,t3_11jiacj

"I read a comment where someone preferred the Glazers to Qatar.

Manchester United's debt has dramatically expanded since the Glazers bought the club in 2005, and they have come under fire for taking cash out of the organisation rather than putting it into the team. The club's on-field performance has suffered as a result of a lack of investment in player development and recruitment. How can owners who collect tens of millions of pounds a year in dividends from the club and don't give a penny back be justified?



Many people also said the Glazers' controversial choice to play in the European Super League in 2021 was proof of their contempt for the views of the supporters and their ignorance of the value of football as a sport driven by the community.

The Glazer family's debt will all be erased by Qatar, who also promise to make considerable investments in the club, its players, and its infrastructure.

"Trigger warning: pointless post about what constitutes a legend. You don't have to interact if you don't want to

I was in a De Gea thread the other day and one of the most upvoted comments was about how anyone who thinks he isn't a legend is deluded. Such a weird thing to say given that the definition of a legend is going to be different for everyone. I've never seen him as a legend because he fails in that one intangible area: a distinct lack of an aura. Or maybe it is tangible; he lacks personality. This manifests both in terms of a lack of ability to command his box verbally and an inability to impose himself physically such as claiming corners and crosses. It also manifests to the fans in that lack of connection that a lot certainly do feel towards him judging by 57% of fans saying they don't consider him a legend in a 2021 poll on RedCafe

Then we can factor in other weak areas of his game like massive inconsistencies between seasons and his appalling distribution. Schmeichel and Van Der Sar were both far superior goalkeepers 

Also I'm not blaming him for the performances in these games but being on the end of so many wallopings definitely affects his legacy

"Hairdryer + Constructive Criticism Incoming:

Yesterday was a wake up call to our most recent form, and ETH has to take the blame for starting Dalot, and in my opinion (I know many will disagree), sticking with this Weghotrst experiment that hasn't shown anywhere near enough good moments to convince me.  

Whether it be directly Weghorst's fault, or just his playstyle, (HIS ATTITUDE AND APPLICATION BTW ARE EXCELLENT I CANT FAULT HIM) ever since he came into the team, we haven't had a comfortable win. Think about it. Before with Martial/Rashford we were finishing teams off within 45 minutes, done, game over, onto the next one.......when was the last one of those games? They were becoming a regular occurance and I can't remember our last one? so YES, there has been a dip in form, but we have been grinding out results. Real talk. 

We have reverted back to trading blows with the other teams, think about how many CRUCIAL saves De Gea has had to make over the past 2 months to keep those scorelines at 0. Just remember how many hes made, before this slump in form, he wasnt having to make any.

Drew vs Palace, Drew vs Leeds, Lost to Arsenal, in these games we created close to no attacking chances because of this experiment, in my opinion. Also, in every one of these games, as soon as he came off, we looked so much better it was crazy. This wasn't in my opinion because of the genius of ETH substitutions, but more just that we took off the element causing us to not create chances. Sadly, again, I like the guy, just doesn't work, and we all saw the difference in play in each game. 

Secondly, Sabitzer has to come into this team, we are playing down how well this man has started for us. Bring back the pace, bring in the Austrian. Sabitzer- Cass with Bruno back in the 10. 

Also, please invest in clever fullbacks. Dalot is not good enough and never has been, Wan will never learn how to attack in the way we want im sorry, Shaw is a world class talent with a mind that error 404's on the regular, weve never signed a player there since Evra with the talent of a Cancelo/Robertson. That position could be levelled up easily. 

Believe in ETH, yes he made some mistakes yesterday, but I also believe fatigue was a big one yesterday, as soon as everyone saw the Cass had run out of energy it was panic stations, just like when he was sent off and the flood gates opened until Sabitzer came on and saved the day. Would love to see both together Eric. With a fast front 3. Onto the next one.",Manchester United,No,jb61kcj,t3_11jiacj

"Bruno exceptionalism in 21/22: ""Yeah he's been crap this season but he's earned a lot of credit from his first 18 months""

Bruno exceptionalism today ""If anyone should be given a pass on poor performances it's Bruno because he plays every game""

How hard is it to acknowledge that he lucked out by being the perfect player for Oleball 1.0. His skills are suited towards counter attacking football, not possession football. Ole tried playing possession football with him in the team last season and it was a disaster. Rangnick couldn't do it. Bruno can't even keep his preferred position under EtH. Is he trusted in the middle of the park? A Burnley striker who has 1 goal in 14 games has shunted Bruno out onto the wing. I don't think EtH rates Bruno as much as this sub does 

And when I say possession football I don't mean tiki taka, I just mean being able to hold onto and transition the ball in midfield and attack. He cannot do it because before his bran can think about playing the obvious 10 yard pass he's already played a 40 yard one to their goalkeeper",Manchester United,No,jb56dkj,t3_11jiacj

It would be interesting to see next game versus Betis, not only results wise but mentality wise: Which players have the strength to perform despite of the social media negativity and which player would succumb the pressure and ETH should get rid of.

We thought Erik had changed the mentality, or in the very least, reinforced it from a bunch of beltway pansies from last season, clearly not, the underlying issues are still there

I get drubbings happen, but its getting too regular for us, and when you look at them all, you can point out, its the same players every single time. Most of our boys arent big game players, they're not mentally resilient. Good when the times are good, but when shit hits the fan, they fold. Bruno, as Captain, needs to rally the troops, make sure everyone gets a grip. He's the first to fall apart. Shaw, while technically proficient, loses his mind when it gets bad. 4 of those goals are on him. Rashford, despite being our goalscorer, cba when shit gets bad, wont press or track back. Dave is terrified to leave his six yard box, man shrinks further into it when it gets bad. Even our bench players, like scott, completely lose their minds and go on a GBH campaign.

I look at the Real Madrid mentality and ask, ""How tf do they do it?"". Even with a weakened side, when their backs are up against the wall, they don't fold, they get down, and go for it. Their CL campaign last season, even recently vs Liverpool, we'd fold if de gea fumbled like that...For me, Questions need to be asked of some of our players, especially some of the senior figures. When they need to step up, especially in big game situations, they fold first. 

This window, we need to look at 4-5 QUALITY FIRST team players, to push out, or even REPLACE some of these weak minded players out. Players who wont fold when it gets hard.

"Awful loss, mainly for the fact that half the team completely gave up and stopped playing in the second half. I'll be generous and chalk it up to burnout from the fixture congestion and our lack of depth, but even conceding 7 we weren't as thoroughly outplayed as we were in either fixture against them last season.

That ""bang average"" Liverpool side still finished with 92 points last season, is on their best run of form all year, and hasn't conceded a league goal in over a month. I said almost a month ago that they're clear favorites for top 4 if they manage to win vs. Newcastle, and they did that without looking anywhere close to their best. They're peaking at the right time. Don't be surprised if they completely outplay Madrid in the second leg of their fixture.

Since Klopp took over in October 2015 we've scored a grand total of TWO goals at Anfield in the league (haven't scored one since December 2018) and won ONE game (in 2016 under LVG). We just had arguably the most intense period of our season with the two legged fixture vs Barca and the Cup final. It's not like we were expected to blow them out of the water. 

Because of Eriksen's injury at the hands of Andy Carroll's butchery, we've essentially had to rely on three players (Rashford, Casemiro, and Bruno) to do everything on the ball. They all played poorly and it showed. Erik ten Hag got the tactics wrong and we didn't have the quality off the bench to transform the game after going behind. 

The score line was exacerbated by some outrageously unprofessional defending and some unlucky bounces. In the first half we were equal if not the better team aside from the first 10-15 mins. Yes this game was awful, but it's nowhere near as embarrassing as the times we've been dominated more thoroughly over the course of 90 minutes. We've played matches where we were so shit that the other team legitimately stopped trying.

We're in the best position we've been in for years, are still 7 points clear of Liverpool and firmly in control of a top 4 spot (which many people thought unrealistic at the beginning of the season). It's going to take more than 3/4 of a season to get back on top under a new manager. The result is way worse on paper than in reality and it was against a team that still has the same core of players that had 97, 99, and 92 points in 3 of the past 4 seasons and made the CL final in 3 of the past 5.

This result isn't going to define EtH's tenure and isn't indicative of a collapse or anything like that. It was a ""perfect storm"" situation in the second half.

"My biggest disappointment today was his awful lack of tracking back and defensive work. Dalot got left out to dry with having to mark Gakpo, Nunez and Robertson sometimes by himself. Fred was doing his best to help before he got subbed but where was Antony? 

I can forgive poor attacking stats in his first season and I hope they get better but I can’t forgive his lack of work rate",Manchester United,Yes,jb3cplx,t1_jb3c09u
and probably EtH will start him again next match,Manchester United,Yes,jb3gvw8,t1_jb3c09u
"I just they won't happen more, don't want a thrashing for us to go on a absolute mad run.

Also this prolly pushes us to win another trophy!

"Arsenal fans are the fans with the smallest mentality in world football. They're still fucking going on about how ""Fergie was a mobster who cheated and robbed his way to every single victory"". 

They will always be a tiny club with a tiny, fragile mindset regardless of what trophies they might win.",Manchester United,Yes,jb559yt,t1_jb53ufr
Are these people banned from their own subs as well? There should be a mutual agreement of sort to ban any and every brigaders,Manchester United,Yes,jb55ruz,t1_jb53ufr

"He’ll probably be benched for the next game. He said himself ten Hag sets the rules. 

His head completely went. The whole team was shit but as the defacto captain he should be keeping his cool and not resorting to stupid behaviours like play acting",Manchester United,Yes,jb4ah6r,t1_jb49xif
"Making the club cheaper for new owners, so they can spend more money investing in the club.

"His best attribute for now seems to be work rate apart from scoring the occasional banger.

Even for a 40-50M winger (his true worth) that's pretty limited.

Gakpo struggled at the start but adapted.

Antony got off to a flyer but his limits are being shown in most games.",Manchester United,Yes,jb320rb,t1_jb30x4g
"He's borderline useless. Sick of fans pretending otherwise. Tired of having to listen to stupid excuses about how he provides balance (you could put any natural right winger there and there'd be no difference) and offers ball retention (he doesn't, no statistic supports that, he just doesn't do anything risky in the final third to affect the game).

Antony offers nothing in attack, and is the exact opposite of a Man United winger. Can't cross, can't pass, can't beat a man, always takes the same fuckin shot, has no right foot. He's not even one-dimensional, as that would imply he's actually really good at something.

His creative numbers are probably the worst of any RW in the league, and he's not a great ball carrier either. One assist in 27 games for a winger, just one big chance created as well. Shockingly mediocre footballer, now I understand why Van Basten used to shit on him all the time.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3r0xc,t1_jb30x4g
"Babe wake up, we gotta let someone else know that Antony cost 100m because of Glazer incompetence, not because he was worth that much.",Manchester United,Yes,jb31gn3,t1_jb30x4g
"He’s so predictable. Always only off his left foot, shoot from edge of the box. It came off against Barca but I feel like that’s all he can do",Manchester United,Yes,jb33now,t1_jb30x4g
"Yeah. We have no use for him here. He can’t play next to Case as he isn’t good enough progressing the ball, can’t play as a 10 as he’s not creative enough, and when we play him as the DM..absolute anarchy on the pitch. We literally have no position in which we can use him effectively. 

He really isn’t even an awful player, playing more advanced or as a box-to-box, but fuck me he is not good enough for United even as a depth option. He was getting run past like he was stuck in fucking treacle, wasn’t showing for passes or protecting the defence. 

Cool £20m-£30m in the summer maybe?",Manchester United,Yes,jb3cweq,t1_jb3c1lf
I think it's perfect.,Manchester United,Yes,jb5it9m,t1_jb5igr9

We even lost 4-0 away to Brighton just last season.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3nj4a,t1_jb36lae
"Yeah. I don’t get idiots that are clamoring on people questioning the tactics of ETH.

Questioning the coach doesn’t mean we have lost the belief. That would be egregiously stupid. 

But when questions need to be raised, they need to be raised.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3o6qn,t1_jb3lpx5
I know one thing. ETH will have bad days but he wouldn't let us down from an attitude and standards perspective.  Not so sure about the Players though.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4deps,t1_jb4d4lh

"It was absolutely ridiculous, conceding 6 goals at anfield in 45 minutes?  A league one team would be disappointed with their side capitulating like that.

We've been battered so often by liverpool and city the past few years, I'd be scared of that shit becoming normalised under a lesser manager. I fully trust ETH to set things straight for our games against them next season though. 

City and liverpool are tough fixtures, you can lose such games but *never* in the manner of today or what we've seen in other games vs them recently.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3b55q,t1_jb37z1i
Liverpool will never win the mighty Bangkok Century Cup. Will always be a small club IMO. Did you see the size of that trophy? Only a big team could win a trophy like that.,Manchester United,Yes,jb2tw9z,t1_jb2tl3u

But looking at Betis’s form, it will be a tough game. They held Madrid to a draw yesterday.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5k5gq,t1_jb5jvqe

Stay strong brother.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3i652,t1_jb3gf4e
"I would say you take a break and come back watching us. Its a game and don’t lose your mental strength to it. My friend who is from Madrid never watches football even though how successful Real is. I asked him why, he told “22 millionaires are kicking a ball to increase their wealth and we all waste our time and money watching that”. Obviously its his opinion but don’t take things close to your heart. Take care and get well soon.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3iaq7,t1_jb3gf4e
"Antony doesn’t have a right foot, that’s why he can’t cross at all. I don’t understand how you can be a professional player and be less two footed than sunday league players. Like Antony and Luke Shaw.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3tacf,t1_jb3shb7
I just don’t understand how Weghorst keeps starting,Manchester United,Yes,jb3tcwz,t1_jb3shb7
"This lot need to go put on another 14km hike. Does not matter that we have a game in 3 days.

Running at least 10km per game is the bare minimum you expect from professional athletes. Heck, you pick 11 reasonably fit redditors in their 20s from this sub and they will run that much.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4p13n,t1_jb4m5c7
"same man, of course people are gonna make fun of us, it's just the game and we would do the same. Tbh we would make jokes about it for years to come so we can't really complain. You gotta laugh, because it really is laughable

People on here though are downright pathetic. All the good feelings and progress we've made seem to be forgotten, players get thrown under the bus, you might think we are sitting in 10th and playing shit football. I see it as a reality check, or rather a reality uppercut",Manchester United,Yes,jb4g51h,t1_jb4ebix

"There was a photo of him going around with Ighalo holding a MUFC jersey when he was here on loan.

Sad thing is we had more clear chances in that 6-1.,Manchester United,Yes,jb2ttyf,t1_jb2ta14
Do we have another interview or press conference? Where did you hear that,Manchester United,Yes,jb5h9tz,t1_jb5h37f
Robben was able to cut inside everytime cuz he was actually fast and strong. Antony sadly doesnt have dutchmans physicality.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6346p,t1_jb61ytu
"I think Antony will never be the winger people would (currently) like.

I think he's more of a movement off the ball winger, keep the ball rotating, than someone who takes on his man all the time. 

He's just not got the pace to be someone who can take on the fullback or get away from them all the time.",Manchester United,Yes,jb673uc,t1_jb61ytu
"He doesn't have the pace to get away from his man. It's weird cos he's clearly not slow, he just doesn't have the kind of pace that'll have him leaving defenders behind

Most of the time he gets away from his full back is because he cuts Infield and the fullback just leaves him for another teammate to bother with

3.4k upvotes for him ""toying with the Newcastle defence"". All I see is a player with infective dribbling",Manchester United,Yes,jb634tx,t1_jb61ytu
Many players have proven me wrong after I write them off but I suspect Anthony may not be able to improve much on taking his player. He will score goals with this curling shorts but I don’t see how he will get the confidence and skills to take on players other than what he is doing now.,Manchester United,Yes,jb645cv,t1_jb61ytu
Antony feels more like a great bench option than a starter for a top 6 club. Before we were interested in him I thought he was a good Raphina replacement at Leeds.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6d47h,t1_jb61ytu
"Thank u.

Been saying this for weeks we need good ball playing players who don't give the ball away easily.

Barcelona in their first leg rarely have the ball away in the midfield which was de jong-gavi-pedri-kessie.

Many PPL here praise Bruno a lot but he gives the ball away easily i get he is a good player but the reason he gives the ball away easily is why he disappears in big games.

Eriksen n casemiro r really good at ball retention.

Most teams nowadays use a 4 man midfield so we need players who don't give the ball away easily in mid plus our passing needs to improve a lot.",Manchester United,Yes,jb713rs,t1_jb6y10g
"Yep, Thursday will be the litmus test to see if our mentality has changed. I’m weirdly confident though, I think, as happened last time, Ten Hag is capable of motivating the team to bounce back from terrible losses

Long term it is absolutely essential we rid ourselves of this terrible capitulation mentality when we play good sides however, otherwise it will always be a spectre hanging over the players when we get far in the League or Europe.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2sm3h,t1_jb2s4g2
They have an incredibly tough schedule ahead. I'd be surprised if they took points off both City and Arsenal,Manchester United,Yes,jb2wnx4,t1_jb2twpr
"A captain should never ever ask to be subbed off unless they are injured. *Yet alone* during an absolute humiliation. Shows how piss poor of a leader he is. This just embodied everything wrong with his attitude and frankly it’s still a rot in the core of the team. Plays for himself not the club, loses his head when things don’t go his way. 

I’m glad ETH has got rid of sidelined the biggest issues but I do doubt him when he makes Bruno captain, it’s just such a terrible decision.",Manchester United,Yes,jb36q5i,t1_jb33sa6
"Didn't he literally just say in an interview a few weeks ago he hates being rested? That 2-3 games a week is nothing for him because he used to play for hours every day as a kid?

I think he just fully lost his head today, his antics were OTT even by normal Bruno shithousery standard. He wouldn't have been asking to be subbed off if we were winning, thats for sure.",Manchester United,Yes,jb38jn2,t1_jb33sa6
No this will stick no matter how the season ends. It's been 12 years and we still take the piss out of Arsenal for that 8-2. We have to live with that.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3cflz,t1_jb3bqux
"People are too emotional. We don't need to extend Weghorst at all. He has scored 1 goal in 14 games. Come on man be real that isn't even good enough to be a backup at this club. Look at the numbers of Nelson, Firmino, Nketiah, Alvarez etc. The backups of other top clubs in the league.",Manchester United,Yes,jb45cco,t1_jb4451r
"Finally people see this, if a st is so bad u have to play him in midfield then do u even have a ST?",Manchester United,Yes,jb46don,t1_jb4451r
"Bruno was put on left wing so Weghorst can be utilized as CAM and Antony as RW. 

While we can appreciate Weghorst work ethic and he surely contributes, but ffs he’s not a caliber of player to sacrifice Bruno’s best position and of Sancho/Garnacho to start as actually LW",Manchester United,Yes,jb4ch3q,t1_jb4cb1v
He will be out after one or two games after that. We need to get a striker in summer.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4cz8b,t1_jb4cqhe
Loooks like ETH rates Elenga more than Pellirstri given Swede sits on the bench and Uruguayan not.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4d036,t1_jb4cqhe
Antony shouldn't fucking start. Absolutely useless player 99% of the time. The most predictable winger I've ever seen,Manchester United,Yes,jb4e2oo,t1_jb4cqhe

"My reactionary ass would run this for the next two game

Ideally Casemiro plays but if he actually injured",Manchester United,Yes,jb5i2gq,t1_jb5h8jl
that sub genuinely has less ball knowledge than football twitter also can’t stand the united flairs on their that twerk for rivals and karma,Manchester United,Yes,jb6k24n,t1_jb6gaej
It'll never happen.,Manchester United,Yes,jb47l55,t1_jb369pc
"I would add another CB to the list, Varane is being overplayed and the other options aren't good enough",Manchester United,Yes,jb4eeyi,t1_jb4e6wr
"A right back is a completely unnecessary transfer target. Dalot and AWB are more than good enough. Dalot when healthy is an excellent player.

Keeper also is not a priority over positions like centre mid. We don't have 70m to go spend on Diogo Costa or something when we need potentially 2 strikers, multiple midfielders and a centre back",Manchester United,Yes,jb4et0s,t1_jb4e6wr
"Yes, we win in the smallest way imaginable.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4ksgi,t1_jb4jlqm
"Yeah. I was pretty numb yesterday, but I'm back to being more optimistic this morning. I'm not discounting the progress this team has made in the last six months, even if it's obvious we still have a long way to go.

From now on,  I'm going to consider giving Liverpool a kicking at Anfield to be the final boss for Ten Hag's rebuild. I look forward to seeing it happen.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4k9pm,t1_jb4k1kp
Because last season's horror shows weren't isolated incidents. You just knew that the 5-0 thrashing at Old Trafford was just an appetizer for what was to come after. This one though was textbook Murphy's law. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Surprised we didn't pick up a red and an injury because it was that sort of day..,Manchester United,Yes,jb4kb15,t1_jb4k1kp
To accommodate Weghorst. Hope that result makes him drop that experiment now.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4vy42,t1_jb4vswb
"When was the last time in the PL that a big money signing winger worked out? Grealish is doing okay, not living up to his price tag. Pepe from Arsenal was a huge flop. Maybe the sweet spot is getting medium priced wingers lol. Worked out for Liverpool",Manchester United,Yes,jb5g8x5,t1_jb5e13g
"I think Sancho still has a better chance of turning thing around based on his Dortmund days, but maybe I am just on hopium.

Antony is a weird case though. There is so much wrong with his game that it is insane. He plays how I would expect Garnacho to be playing. It is not impossible for him to turn it around, but I have very limited expectations.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5ifkc,t1_jb5e13g
Desperately begging for Harry Kane at this point. Perfect striker for our needs imo.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6fz1h,t1_jb6dd90
"No it won't.

Our wingers bar Sancho don't create anything for our forwards most games.

Even if we had Haaland he'd struggle.

May end positional roulette but if your wingers are interested more in shooting than creating then a CF isn't going to do anything.

**Expected assists:**

Sancho: 44th percentile

Rashford: 25th percentile 

Garnacho: 22nd percentile

Antony: 3rd percentile

**Key passes :**

Sancho : 94th percentile

Antony: 16th percentile

Rashford: 12th percentile

Garnacho:  1st percentile",Manchester United,Yes,jb6i4ro,t1_jb6dd90
"The optimism of a few fans really just went off the charts the last week or so. Most of our fans were tempering expectations to an extent but the ‘impervious title charge’ comments that started to pop up were very premature. I think our fans (me included) just really miss and are pining for even a hint of us challenging for the PL in a weird year.

Just shows, no matter how shit our rivals seem to be they are always a massive threat. Pissed me off though that we probably kickstarted Liverpool’s return to some sort of form just like they did for us earlier in the season.

Oh well, we go again. Still in for 2 Cups. 1-3 Cups and 3rd? I’d have bitten your hand off for that at the start of the season.",Manchester United,Yes,jb364sj,t1_jb35ifr
I would follow EtH to war. I don’t care if he wants an entirely new 25 man group next season.,Manchester United,Yes,jb5kiij,t1_jb5h4qg
Look at all the maulings we received last few years and see what players were a part of each one. It’s not a coincidence.,Manchester United,Yes,jb5hjtd,t1_jb5h4qg
Totally agree. I’m with EtH all the way. If he decides to stick them all in the U21s I back his decision,Manchester United,Yes,jb5n6jm,t1_jb5h4qg
"For me it's a combination of a lot of factors. I personally think that the previous years   
and managers that were horrendous still play a part in everything. A lot of these players played under Mourinho, Solskjaer and Rangnick which were all bad and I'm sure the bad mental strength that these players have is still up to the coaching from the previous managers. Imagine playing for 2 years under Ole. There are players that probably weren't even properly coached for those two years and they still play for us to this day. Can you imagine how much experience they lost in that time? Also, we can of course thank the Glazers because they too set up Ten Hag for this moment, because they refused to buy the players he wanted, which forced him to overplay most of the current squad which in turn leaded to this horror show. I'm sure if Qatar buys the club and give Ten Hag a blank check we'll be looking at a very, very different team next season. So people need to look the broader picture and get too sad with this result, because the difference between losing last year to Liverpool and this year is that now we can actually see a clear direction, so I got my hopes up for next season. I think we can do a lot with this manager",Manchester United,Yes,jb60hxe,t1_jb5h4qg
"Yep. Resistance has come from now ETH has transformed the team completely and so has gained a lot of favour. 

But he got it wrong today and it’s okay to say that. The lineup was experimental and it did not work. That doesn’t mean anyone’s Ten Hag out, fuck that, this is the most positive I’ve felt about the club since Fergie. However he’ll know he made important mistakes in that match, just like the players.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2vkub,t1_jb2uuk9
Yup.. he will learn too. It was frustrating to see Bruno on LW when you have two wingers on the bench. Nobody saw this result coming and the players showed they still need more time to not capitulate.,Manchester United,Yes,jb2wgy9,t1_jb2uuk9
"Tbf, the Weghorst no 10 'bullshit' worked against Barcelona and he has been awful as a no.9.

Lot of things to blame ETH for today, but given how he has been hung out to dry with his options upfront, this is not one of them.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3tgcb,t1_jb3spjl
People have been calling him a flop all season. Stop this,Manchester United,Yes,jb4dw8g,t1_jb4cqsx

"My coworker is a Liverpool fan, and I gotta see him tomorrow. Fuck me.",Manchester United,Yes,jb340qf,t1_jb30edu
It’s baffling we spent 100M on a winger who can’t even do that 🤢,Manchester United,Yes,jb469um,t1_jb45z3w
Normally it helps getting an espresso and a good book to cheer me up in the day...i just stared out the window sipping that cold coffee thinking about the score :(,Manchester United,Yes,jb5p07l,t1_jb5n2sb
"What pissed me off was seeing players fraternizing with the Liverpool players after that humiliating loss.

Call me old fashioned but you only get to do that if it was hard fought match.

If you get your ass handed to you, either run to the showers or apologize the away fans and then run to the showers.",Manchester United,Yes,jb66xvl,t1_jb642sv
just remember football is just lads kicking a ball,Manchester United,Yes,jb31w87,t1_jb30pql
I'd imagine most people on this sub have realised it's all PR agencies at this point. I miss the glory days of twitter when players obviously tweeted for themselves but it's become PR central so I don't even look nowadays,Manchester United,Yes,jb37k37,t1_jb379zo
This is pretty much all companies and many celebrities these days. My wife works in PR and social media is a skill set/ job role (to write in someone else’s voice),Manchester United,Yes,jb387ow,t1_jb379zo

Who cares? Ronaldo is basically retired.,Manchester United,Yes,jb502wt,t1_jb4zv62
"If Ronaldo was still starting every match we'd be in the bottom half of the table fighting a relegation battle, and his fanboys would be saying Ronaldo is the only thing stopping us from being bottom of the league. 

They're demented, everyone of them, they follow the individual and not the team which is why they don't understand football.  It's like me trying to understand chess by focusing on the rook and barely paying attention to all the other pieces.",Manchester United,Yes,jb51dxt,t1_jb4zv62
And I hear my local pub team won 11-2 at the weekend so I guess I should be jumping for joy.,Manchester United,Yes,jb59izk,t1_jb58gcu

Man's had a stinker.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6ahwi,t1_jb65xsg
"We responded well after being beaten by City, and after losing to Villa. Granted, this loss was a magnitude worse than either of those, but I expect a similar reaction.

Ten Hag won't accept sulking or moping, or negativity, and I don't believe Casemiro, Varane, Martinez etc will either. There are still some mentally fragile players at the club, so we'll have to watch for how they react, but I have faith that the team as a whole will bounce back quickly.

We need to beat Betis and then, hopefully, thump Southampton to get back on a roll.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4j10z,t1_jb4iqdq
"Im literally devastated. Slept like shit, haven't been able to get any work done today. Feels like shit man",Manchester United,Yes,jb40wru,t1_jb40lme
Wasn’t Gerrard sent off after like 38 seconds against us?,Manchester United,Yes,jb44860,t1_jb43hcz
"It's definitely the sort of 'outsmarting yourself' thing that Pep likes to do. Sometimes (a lot of the time, actually) in football, it's better to just say, 'they know we're going to do this, but we're better than them and they can't stop us.' That should have been the thinking with Rashford vs TAA yesterday.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4guoo,t1_jb4gmvx
Weghorst played as 10 because we don’t score in fast attacks when he’s CF. The question is why tf he has a default place in starting lineup when he’s neither our best CF nor best CAM,Manchester United,Yes,jb4hovs,t1_jb4gmvx
"I think it's more a case of Ten Hag having to shoehorn whoever's fit to play into whatever position because the whole first team is shattered. If he decided Rashford was too tired to run up and down the flanks for 90 minutes but could probably do a less demanding job upfront, that would make sense given how many games we've played lately. We need a lot of new squad options this summer.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4h1lb,t1_jb4gmvx
I agree however unfortunately liverpool have won the most trophies,Manchester United,Yes,jb4oa07,t1_jb4np33
"We don't concede more than 4 goals yesterday if we had Alisson in goal. De Gea makes great saves for the cameras but totally inefficient. Doesn't command the box, doesn't claim crosses, doesn't sweep, poor on the ball, poor in 1v1s and literally a below average shot stopper as evident in the stats.

He saved us till 2018 no doubt, but after that he has been a liability. Klopp came in replaced Mignolet with Karius and when it didn't work out replaced him with Alisson. Pep replaced England's number 1 Hart with Bravo and when it didn't work out got Ederson. 

None of the top managers compromised for their number 1, so I know Ten Hag won't either.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6705r,t1_jb65u6u
"He needs to be replaced but it’s at the bottom of the list imo. Midfielders, a new striker and a Maguire replacement are the top priorities. Then I’d probably say a new keeper   Unless Qatar buys us soon and we can have a Chelsea like summer window it may be hard to do it all in one summer",Manchester United,Yes,jb6iy9r,t1_jb65u6u
He needs replacing in the summer,Manchester United,Yes,jb6ehhf,t1_jb65u6u
"We're paying DDG £375,000 a week and he can't do the bare basics of his job.  Let that sink in, £375,000 per fucking week.  This club!

Not even 3rd choice for Spain.  Mentally weak, physically puny, can't catch a cross, can barely pass to a teammate, gets a nosebleed if he leaves his line, and is about as brave as my sausage dog... yeah he's a legend alright, a legendary bloody fraud. 

It would be a sickening blow if he's given a new contract at even a tenth of what he is earning now.",Manchester United,Yes,jb68uq0,t1_jb65u6u
"i think the problem is the complete opposite compared to Brentford, we’re absolutely drained physically that as soon as the goals started leaking, we collapsed mentally, we’ve played so many games, making them run is just going to make upcoming fixtures worse

"I've already seen enough of Antony, get rid. I'd rather play Pellistri at this point, at least he can beat a man and whip in a cross. That first half chance where a simple ball across would've released Rashford yet he messed it up. He's probably the least creative winger at club, just a glorified ball recycler at this point. No cutting edge, teams don't have to worry about him.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4djjw,t1_jb4d689
"I have to agree with you.
The problem is is that there are so few left-footed right-wingers in the market, let alone any of them that are quality.
Last summer there was literally him, Raphinha and Asensio that were available, out of players that are 'known' quantities in Europe.
Raphinha rejected Chelsea for Barca so I don't think we were really in with a shout for him, especially because he was ex-Leeds.
I remember there was talk of Asensio but from what I've read, ETH wasn't that keen on him.
In hindsight, I wish we had got someone like Kulusevski the summer prior.
He doesn't seem that fast when I watch him play for Spurs but he's very direct and is waaay more two-footed than Antony is.
He also seems to have a much higher football IQ and makes better decisions about passing options.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4fgt2,t1_jb4d689
"He was 80 mln acutally. 80 mln nowdays gets you players like Antnony Sancho or Mudryk so no way we sing anyone better for 50mln

Not like im deffending Antony but thats how it is in market.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4djop,t1_jb4d689
I hate this take. Just a scapegoat. The price tag is not his fault. He scores goals for us. If you want a scapegoat for yesterday have a look at Dalot. Was he even playing?,Manchester United,Yes,jb4h7pk,t1_jb4d689
"Someone needs to make a spreadsheet of all the starting lineups and subs that have been involved in all these games. The only player off the top of my head I can think started all these is DDG. From the current squad, I think McTominay, Shaw, Fred, Fernandes and Rashford will feature a lot in these lineups too. Maguire and AWB might be in some too but they didn’t play yesterday.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5awzp,t1_jb5aiyl
People calling this a freak result does my head in. What's frekish is the consistency of these batterings. We've been proper shite at times since 2013 but this never used to happen until recently.,Manchester United,Yes,jb5ay0h,t1_jb5aiyl

"It was unprofessional 100%, another ref could have easily given a red card.

"United are proper hated by everyone these days, so it’s no surprise every action of every player is scrutinised to the max. There was nothing in it, same with the shaw “kick” to Darwin’s head.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5oc5s,t1_jb5k37q

Wouldn't be surprised if he goes out full swing for the Europa now or well does the extreme low of sitting everyone on the bench and rotating heavily,Manchester United,Yes,jb46yt5,t1_jb45ygw

"Sabitzer, AWB and Malacia needs to play. 

I love Shaw, I think he can do with a little protecting after this. Just take him out of the firing line for a bit. It was embarrassing. Not saying he shouldn’t be critiqued, but this can mentally derail your season. 

Maguire probably starts. If there’s anytime you need your club captain to step up, it’s now? 

The WW #10 experiment needs to stop. It threw the opponent defense off for the first few times but now it’s got found out. 

Also. 

Sabitzer needs to start. Sabitzer needs to start. Sabitzer needs to start.",Manchester United,Yes,jb48ja1,t1_jb47w7v

"I don’t think it was worse than last season. Last season was fucking horrific. Yesterday was just shocking. I still felt like the players cared yesterday, but just lost their heads after feeling a bit hard done by with the two goals either side of half time. Similar to what happened to Leicester at Old Trafford. We stung them with a Rashford goal and then they just fell apart. The good news is we’re still in two competitions where we control our own destiny, whereas Liverpool are almost out of all competitions and depend on others fucking it over the next few weeks.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4jius,t1_jb4j0rm

Theres a new game on thursday, then a new game three days later, and so forth. This will sting, but great new moments will happen and help with alleviating the pain. Things will get better because of ETH. I think we can allow ourself to give him that trust because of the season thus far.

We should not forget that great progress have been made this season, we’ve won a cup, still in the run for the FA cup, 7 points clear of Liverpool in the top three, and lastly possibility of winning the EL.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4chy3,t1_jb4bw0e

"I wouldn't mind if we'd paid £40m for him, but £90m was crazy money. For that, you want an instant gamechanger. He could develop into one, but so far he's more like Dirk Kuyt with the ability to curl a nice left foot shot.

He's scored some important goals, but he needs to be more consistently involved and more consistently effective.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4efpq,t1_jb4e34m

"Of course the manager will take the blame in 7-0 loss. It’s not his fault players gave up mid game, but it’s his fault we were put in the position for players to gave up. 

Weghosrt, Antony has way bigger margin for error/mediocre performances than Jadon/Garnacho or even never utilized Pellistri. They shouldn’t start in the games when we’re not going to control the possession and rely on fast attacks. And he should’ve reacted in half time, not waiting for us to fall behind even more.

Bruno was non-existent on the left wing. Why not try playing four in midfield against top teams and stop them dominating the middle of the pitch? They were streaming forward in massive amounts of space whenever they wanted.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3gcwq,t1_jb3fahd
"The midfield issue could have been solved today if ETH could have taken precautions, you are away to Anfield that you hav not win or even scored any goal in many years.

"We need to drop Bruno and play with Sabitzer there, you’re right. Weghorst as a striker (because we have no one fucking else), Rashford on the left and Sancho on the right (Antony needs to be dropped after this performance).

Malacia in for Shaw and AWB in for Dalot. Varane and Martinez need to stay, I still have faith in them as I do in Casemiro. Casemiro needs a rest though but his sub is McTominay so Casemiro plays almost all the time every game.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3cidb,t1_jb3c31u
"That was one of few concerns Ajax fans were telling us about him, he plays same players untill he hit annuall bad spell.

Most of them argue he wins more games this way anyways so I will wait more than one season to judge his strict first XI policy.",Manchester United,Yes,jb684bq,t1_jb67kjy
"I hate this narrative but who does he rotate with? We rotated against west ham 3 days ago and showed why he doesn't want to rotate. The squad depth is the bare bones of quality and you expect united to be in all competitions. It doesn't work like that my friend. 

It's same nonsense I hear with Wout and why he doesn't replace him. Because there is no player that can play striker there as the other striker is always injured. 

I get it, we lost badly yesterday but blaming others without reasoning will get us no where. 

You could see this defeat was coming (not 7-0 though) with the way our schedule is from end of december. The last 4 games were barca (W), newcastle (won trophy), west ham (W) and scums which we lost. What do you expect is going to happen with this squad? Win every games till the end of the game whilst playing a game after 3 days? Be more realistic.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6am81,t1_jb67kjy

It's not a freak result. They beat us 5-0 at OT last season. We shipped 6 to City and 4 to Brentford this season. This team capitulates at times and it should be acknowledged,Manchester United,Yes,jb63fy3,t1_jb5zh7j
"As I said on another post, I hope the players are dreading heading to the office today, as much as I am",Manchester United,Yes,jb40wgh,t1_jb3zmg2
It’s why I’m fine with moving past DDG. in my opinion he doesn’t have a winners personality. There is a reason he doesn’t play for Spain and a reason he’s been involved in so many humiliating losses. He’s good at the reflex stuff but he has a weak mentality and crumbles too easily,Manchester United,Yes,jb4srzk,t1_jb4ru3a
He’s 29 in September,Manchester United,Yes,jb3e9pk,t1_jb3culd
"He’s 28. I agree. In terrible situations when it’s all going sideways the captain absolutely needs to have a bit about him and I’m also getting tired of this petulant child mode he gets into. People will dismiss it as “passion” or “doesn’t like to lose” but I grew up watching a couple of players who wore the armband at this club who those attributes would have equally applied to and they never ever acted like they just wanted to go home with their ball because life was hard on them one day. 

That was disappointing to see amidst all the other disappointing things.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3h1bt,t1_jb3culd
"I don't know if he was asking to be subbed off, that was Gary Neville's interpretation and everyone seems to have gone with that interpretation.  From memory I think he waved his hands in the air seemingly towards the bench when Rashford got taken off, although everything from yesterday is getting a bit cloudy to me, so I could be mistaken

I mean maybe he was looking for instructions from the bench but didn't get them, or maybe he did want to leave the field, but then maybe he had good reason to, maybe he was carrying an injury, or maybe we've completely misinterpreted his gesture, and maybe it wasn't even towards the bench?  Who the fuck knows.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4z5w6,t1_jb4x2hm
He asked who was getting subbed off.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4zaxv,t1_jb4x2hm
"The most cavani like player right now would surely be Valencia striker... Edison Cavani :)

Joking aside, I agree with the other response, I have been saying all season despite him misfiring in front of goal, Nunez is gonna be an absolute weapon once he sorts out end product.

They had 7 goals from 8 shots on target with 2.3 xG. But the players' downing tools made it worse. It was never a 7-0 game.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6p4fr,t1_jb6o3ws
"Cheers mate. It had been trending down for a few weeks to be honest, we were due a loss because fatigue and games were piling up. This though..this was complete capitulation and won’t be forgotten. For example you guys would never let yourselves be beaten by a fellow top 6 team 7-0, we’ve had 4 or 5 of these similar blowouts the past 2 seasons. 

Top 4 was always the goal though, we’re all in for the long haul with Ten Hag.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3bpfq,t1_jb3b2qe

"we lost 7-0, every single one of them was a 0 today",Manchester United,Yes,jb31fvq,t1_jb30g4z
Bruno legit acted like a petulant adolescent today who just wasn’t getting his way. And I heard Gary Neville said he asked to come off towards the end? Seriously what kind of captain is he? They need to strip him of the armband. He was no captain today. Arguable the worst player on the pitch. I get he’s played the most minutes this season but still,Manchester United,Yes,jb33yo1,t1_jb30g4z
to be honest we lot celebrated arsenal going down 2-0 to bournemouth. Its just natural to celebrate at misery of ur rivals specially when it comes to arsenal and united its totally understandable,Manchester United,Yes,jb44mpy,t1_jb43vyp

"I hope after this game ETH realizes Antony’s shortcomings. Which are a lot, considering he’s one of the starters. He can’t just keep defending him match after match like this. Sure, he has had his good moments, but he has to improve massively, or he must be benched/rotated on a regular basis. 

Hopefully this summer ETH puts him in an intensive crossing/ dribbling training or something.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4xdjq,t1_jb4ss1q
"He hasn't. Simple as that.

>What was he not doing in August that he's doing now?

He's trying his signature left foot curl up shots even more often. He's also become more annoying with his childish aggresion, pointless dribbling attempts. I don't know about this guy anymore.

The only thing going for him are few improtant goals he's scored.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4x13i,t1_jb4ss1q

"I was just going to come back and comment about him. I was angry about the 1st goal but after reading Ducker’s analysis of the goals he is also the main culprit for the 4th goal as well. Loses the ball and standing still watching is unforgivable.

He is among the worst players yesterday imo, considering he added nothing to the attack, as his main responsibility requires.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4wsvg,t1_jb4w0fw
"There was also a counter attack where antony was on the left and needed to cross the ball in or play it through for rashy and he super casually plays it straight to I think konate. There was no urgency, no desire, no hunger, playing like its a friendly or something. Then a sheepish smile like ah one of those things. Meanwhile gakpo on the other end completely the opposite. Anyway not like he was the only one who played shit yesterday, can't exactly single him out",Manchester United,Yes,jb4y7y7,t1_jb4w0fw

"Let's ignore the moral implications for the sake of argument.

There is no guarantee that spending money leads to success, see PSG. Despite no other team coming close to a fraction of their budget, they still manage to lose the league twice. And their CL record is atrocious.

Arsenal don't have unlimited money, and looks like they will win the league this season.

So let's stop pretending that Qatar would save us. We make enough of our money to compete well. What's needed is a good organizational structure and decision making, that's the real problem",Manchester United,Yes,jb5f91o,t1_jb564co

But that should've been obvious. We were nowhere near a top top level club and Liverpool have showed this to us to maximum effect 3 times over,Manchester United,Yes,jb6a5d6,t1_jb69lpt
I remember watching that game and that was another freak result. Every shot Aston villa had went in along with so many deflections. Very very similar.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6o95f,t1_jb6lw41
Out of all players Bruno should be given a pass on poor performances. Look at his minutes compared to every one else. He plays every minute of every game. He needs to be rotated out but we have no one who can cover for him right now,Manchester United,Yes,jb53c0l,t1_jb50hj1
Imma be honest im not a huge fan of bruno as a player or person but i try to be as fair as possible with him but yesterday was a major disgrace honestly. Like you said if it was maguire there'd be a massive dingdong about him doing this,Manchester United,Yes,jb51pxu,t1_jb50hj1
"Any measured criticism of Bruno gets instantly downvoted on here and then you get accused of having an agenda against him which leads to personal abuse (I once had someone go through my Reddit history to bring up something non football related because I was critical of him). The only times you can criticise him on here and get away with it are the times shortly after getting trounced 

He'll revert back to his XX goal contributions in XX games after a while and will once again become a demigod on here because so many modern football fans lack the nuance to understand there's way more to being a good footballer than racking up goals and assists. Even at his best he's unbelievably overrated",Manchester United,Yes,jb53ztg,t1_jb50hj1
"It's incredible that a player who doesn't even do the bare basics of his job, like catch a fucking cross, or come out and sweep or pass to one of his teammates once in a while, has lasted 10 years at this club.  And people call him a legend?  What a sad indictment for this club.

If you don't do the basics and you aren't stopping shots, then you are basically a spectator, you are a zero out of ten.  In fact you are worse than a spectator, because at least a spectator makes a bit of bloody noise.  

You can't have a player in the team who is going to be producing multiple 1/10 performances during the season.  Sure, he'll have the odd day where he makes some great camera saves, but then Pogba had some great days too, I think he got 4 assists in one match, but he was a waste of space too.  

Want a consistent team?  Then find consistent players who at least have the fundamentals to fall back on, and won't be dropping down to a 1 out of 10 multiple times a season.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5gg9j,t1_jb5djq1
"Because there's other position that in dire need of upgrade and backup. We still don't have clinical striker, Martial get injured all the time and Weghorst can't finish to save his life. Our midfield depth is horrible, Casemiro is great but he will get knackered for playing each game possible. 

If we solve this two positions first, then we can talk about replacing De Gea",Manchester United,Yes,jb5evrf,t1_jb5djq1
If this is another false dawn i genuinely don’t know how I’ll cope,Manchester United,Yes,jb4x54v,t1_jb4vrcb
"Hindsight is 20/20. Fred was in white hot form previously, Sabitzer hadn’t really played as a duo with Case and so not worth throwing him in for the first time at Anfield against Pool. 

Ten Hag thought we’d need the legs of Fred to win the midfield battle and I understand why he started him, Fred was really not great today though. 

Wish Sabitzer had had some more playing time with Case before this match",Manchester United,Yes,jb2s6qr,t1_jb2rahj
"Sabitzer for Fred would have changed absolutely nothing. Casemiro Bruno Shaw and Martinez all dropped 0/10 performances, once that happens you’re pretty much fucked no matter who else is on the pitch",Manchester United,Yes,jb3pc7h,t1_jb3nz9t
"For Weghorst 2 of our best players have to play out of position, Bruno on wings and rashford upfront. It's like nerfing both of your star players to accommodate a championship level player, he is hard worker I get it but there should be no scenario where bruno and rashford take the backseat. Rashford vs taa was something to look forward to, instead we got bruno against him, who has no pace as a winger his attributes suit him as 10 not a winger. Personally i hope we are done with bruno on wing experiment",Manchester United,Yes,jb3pgmh,t1_jb3nz9t
Amateur hour. The shaw clearance summed it up was like the days of ragnick and ole him and Maguire running into each other.,Manchester United,Yes,jb43tih,t1_jb43aut
"Yeah this summary is accurate, it’s quite impressive how well distributed the fuck-ups are. Got most of the starting 11 in there each responsible for a goal or two.

I don’t know if Shaw was just carrying a knock still in this game? But I don’t think I’ve seen him make a worse performance in his career for us. Usually he’s just excellent so I couldn’t believe my eyes as he made mistake after mistake.",Manchester United,Yes,jb43xub,t1_jb43aut
"Goal 1 - Antony is also majorly at fault for not tracking back and assisting Dalot with Robertson.

Goal 2 - starting from the misplaced pass by Shaw.",Manchester United,Yes,jb45nex,t1_jb43aut
Not if they don't remove the debt,Manchester United,Yes,jb4sw1t,t1_jb4rdgr
Russo scored United's first hattrick in the WSL today! That's all I can think of.,Manchester United,Yes,jb2vq3m,t1_jb2vdlb
Eth underestimated this game. He really thought he can go in with his everyday formation and win it,Manchester United,Yes,jb3khtx,t1_jb3j8xv
"Yup. Starting Rashy on the left and Weghorst in the middle and Bruno at 10, as he has done in most of the previous games, could have worked much much better.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3leak,t1_jb3j8xv
I think xG is a measure of the quality of the chances created rather than literally meaning that's how many goals they are expected to score.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3uy2a,t1_jb3tmbn
Having to watch the second half every morning before training?,Manchester United,Yes,jb4ha1x,t1_jb4h52l
"Nothing they aren't kids, they are grown adults and professionals and they know they fucked up yesterday. 

They don't need to be punished to see what happened yesterday. The entire team, manager included, will be working as one unit this morning and working on putting it right. We work harder in training, we work harder every weekend and we continue with resilience to build and secure the top four this year and challenge for any other trophy we can.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4hz29,t1_jb4h52l
"Hold them accountable. Ask them to recognise their mistakes and ensure they don't happen again.

I don't really care about fining them wages, because that means nowt when they earn £100k a week. I'd rather they just fix their shit in training and come back to beat Betis in midweek.

I would drop some of them for the next game, because they're clearly fatigued as well as having played like shit. Malacia for Shaw, AWB for Dalot, Sancho for Antony, Sabitzer for Bruno and McTominay for Fred. Probably Lindelof for Varane as well.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4i8c4,t1_jb4h52l
Fined a weeks wages or some sort of bonus is cut by 50%.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4hao8,t1_jb4h52l
Win the FA Cup and secure third place. Couldn’t give a fuck about the score. It was a freak result. I’d be more worried if I was Liverpool fan and my team only turn up against United all season.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4jwnh,t1_jb4h52l
"Drop them for a week. They miss the EL game and Southampton at home. We can hopefully get something off Southampton with our second string, and it probably wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if we got knocked out of the EL and didn't have to play as many games.

Then when the first team gets back they've had some time to rest up.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4hcgl,t1_jb4h52l
"Watch their own “highlights” reel. Report back to EtH/coaching staff and offer an explanation as to why they threw in the towel at 2-0. There’s being gassed and then there’s just not turning up 

I can see some of them being benched for Thursday.

I’d like to say get them to donate a weeks wages but we all know they wouldn’t do that so no point even entertaining it.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4ojwd,t1_jb4h52l
Someone bought me a 7 Up last night,Manchester United,Yes,jb5fcxq,t1_jb5caiu
"its clear neville misunderstood it and bruno never asked for it, there is no clip or anything to prove this.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5ndrj,t1_jb5n0k3
 Nah he was just confused as to who was coming off. To me it looked like he was asking if he was being subbed not asking to be subbed,Manchester United,Yes,jb5oyt2,t1_jb5n0k3
"i actually felt as if rival fans have invaded this sub and are trolling our players disguised as united fans, but no its our own who have turned against players.",Manchester United,Yes,jb48oh4,t1_jb48i47
"hey man, no amount of football is ever worth yours or anyone’s life, talk to someone, anyone, me included, there is so much to live for even if you can’t see it right now.

Honestly talk to someone. My DMs are open if you want to chat,Manchester United,Yes,jb33o8r,t1_jb33i6m
"Jesus, my guy.  Seriously, if you're considering it over people kicking a football on a bit of grass. Get some help mate.

 Edit: Just realised this might be completely unrelated to footy and you feeling that way about life in general. Either way, please get some help buddy.",Manchester United,Yes,jb33sn2,t1_jb33i6m
Talk to someone. My DMs opened as well. Take care,Manchester United,Yes,jb34csi,t1_jb33i6m
"Time will always be on your side come emotions after a tough, or in this case fucking brutak, loss. Feelings run high, and it can be a lot on top of other things happening in your life. Try to distract yourself best way possible, and give it some time, 1 week. 

Sports can draw out a lot of emotions, and it can  feel like the world is ending. But try to make sure it is not your own life that ia ending. No result or sportingevent is worth dying for. It's only an aspect in life, where you can choose how much you want to put of yourself towarda it. 

Good luck, and don't do irrational decisions when emotions are running in high-gear",Manchester United,Yes,jb374qy,t1_jb33i6m
I hope you were joking.,Manchester United,Yes,jb37pbr,t1_jb33i6m
Casemiro,Manchester United,Yes,jb4smh7,t1_jb4rspo
How does that make sense if he lacks discipline it's gonna cost the team Erik wouldn't even start him anyways,Manchester United,Yes,jb4swj7,t1_jb4sl7o
"I think he sticks him out wide because of his lack od ball retention, losing the ball as a wide player is far less frustrating and dangerous to us than it is if bruno loses it in the middle. Thats my take",Manchester United,Yes,jb4vryn,t1_jb4sl7o
"Well this passes the eye test, when we lose we tend to collapse",Manchester United,Yes,jb4z31v,t1_jb4yvmo
"FYI, players usually don't post by themselves on social media, with a few exceptions",Manchester United,Yes,jb5qiwo,t1_jb5pjju
"""you're losing 5-0 mate"" when Bruno went after trent. Could hear Spitty laughing in the background as the goals went in too, sounded like a Catherine Tate character.",Manchester United,Yes,jb66u7b,t1_jb635io
I'd rather we win 4 and lose 1 by 1 😂,Manchester United,Yes,jb709b7,t1_jb6xz8x
"I guess everyone is 'overreacting' because of the nature of the loss and not the loss itself. Losing by 2-3 goals is ok but by 7 goals, against Liverpool, in our current form? That's why. I have made peace with it. EtH will sort this out. I believe in him",Manchester United,Yes,jb3r9q2,t1_jb3qis1
"Our biggest loss in like a 100 years, to fucking liverpool of all people. We're not overreacting. Its gut wrenching, fucking heartbreaking. Its a little early for some of us to be positive about any of it.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3rwk7,t1_jb3qis1
"People like you need to understand that swiping such a pathetic performance is not the way to go if we want to win titles. Especially when we concede big three fking times in a single season.

Swiping your problems under the rug and shrugging them of, only looking at the highs of the season is incredibly idiotic and dangerous. Not what winners do.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3qy9q,t1_jb3qis1
"that was not a lose
that was embarrassment",Manchester United,Yes,jb3r6ea,t1_jb3qis1
"That’s what I hate the most, it’s literally our best season in the last 10 years and people are reacting as if we’re going to get relegated after this loss. I understand why people are angry but come one we had 11 unbeaten games before this. Losing 7-0 to Liverpool is unacceptable but we’re still 7 points above them. And if this loss means that the team will be better next season im all for it. Let’s remember where we were last year and then look at the results.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3r9gb,t1_jb3qis1
"every player dropped a stinker yesterday, and coming to de gea if it werent for him and his early saves in games of leicester,west ham we would be down by 2 or more goals and comeback would have been even more difficult. Yesterdays match shouldnt be used to evaluate someone as not even 1 player performed to their potential each and everyone shared the blame for that loss.",Manchester United,Yes,jb46rys,t1_jb46gri
"Bit flippant, this. We should focus on obtaining another keeper this summer, but DDG shouldn't leave. He could definitely be a back-up choice.",Manchester United,Yes,jb46kdy,t1_jb46gri
Erik is going to lay into those guys. I won't be surprised if half of them are benched for Betis as a message.,Manchester United,Yes,jb49myb,t1_jb49kvk
"same players won us our 1st trophy in 6 years just a week back xD u are expecting players to go on monster run under ten hag in his 1st season? the progress we have achieved so far is nothing short of miracle considering the disaster last season was. We are still a work under progress, yes the loss sucked it was humiliating but its not the end of the world. Ten hag and players will get back to their usual run of form yesterday was exception",Manchester United,Yes,jb49yyl,t1_jb49kvk
"Equalling our worst ever defeat. This won't be easily forgotten and considering it follows on from last seasons 5-0 and 4-0 losses to Liverpool, questions needs to be answered.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3h1x1,t1_jb3fwfd
I think yesterday was the Villa 3-1 game with everything going wrong and Nunez and Gakpo being world class movement and finishing wise. Salah wrecked us but that was down to Shaw having a really really poor game. Attitude from Bruno and Antony was shocking and Fred didn't provide any cover.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3pi3i,t1_jb3pa09
"We deserved all the blame now, it was not just a defeat, it was a historical humiliation, no excuse ab that.

A true Manucian should feel upset, even if we bounce back next match, it's hard for people to forget a 0-7 lost to our biggest rival. That's fact",Manchester United,Yes,jb3vy6f,t1_jb3ul44
"biggest club in the world, they were waiting for us and it didn’t help that there’s a loud group of fans bragging about our recent successes and overhyping this team (obviously a lot of it was tongue in cheek but still). sadly, there’s nothing we can do that will make a statement besides win everything lol",Manchester United,Yes,jb3ush4,t1_jb3ul44
"Why the fuck would you rewatch it?

I went to the gym at 2-0 and I’m glad that I did.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4c5fh,t1_jb4bvx7
Wow you are like a comedian or something!,Manchester United,Yes,jb4u5p0,t1_jb4stgh
"Yes, I think having won a trophy, this team has done enough to deserve the calm but some of the supposed leaders’ behaviour at critical time is worrying.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5g8i1,t1_jb5fpim
I think something that had worked previously just got exploited here. I’m sure he will learn from this.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4245n,t1_jb41poc
"It's a collective fuck up. The tactics were awful, and so were the players. It's not an either or.",Manchester United,Yes,jb48jc0,t1_jb41poc
"If the tactics were not right, you might lose one, two or even three goals, but definitely not 7 goals",Manchester United,Yes,jb44f37,t1_jb41poc
"Commentator yesterday said under SAF we conceded 4+ goals in a premier league match like only 4 or 5 times. Since he has retired it happens almost every season, actually like two to three times every season. Fuckinh Everton put 4 past us, Spurs put 6 past us. It's a joke",Manchester United,Yes,jb4bpev,t1_jb4amll
"Since when is top 4 going to be an issue?  Liverpool is certainly making its way back up top.  But other than that Idt there is legitimate concern unless we suffer through injuries.  Newcastle has dipped a bit recently and don’t look as good   They haven’t won a game in their last 5 PL matches.    Even though they have 2 matches in hand their recent form doesn’t make me believe they can take advantage of it.  Spurs are gonna Spurs. And even then we have a game in hand  Granted Liverpool May surpass us for third ( which is still not definite) but Idt top 4 is an issue unless there are injuries. 

Maybe we should bow out of Europa and just rest everyone but I’d like to see what we can do in the FA cup.   But these cups are good to set the foundation for a winning culture even if they aren’t major trophies",Manchester United,Yes,jb6httq,t1_jb6d6jl
Would you rather get stabbed in the arse by a kitchen knife or stabbed in the other arse cheek by a butcher knife,Manchester United,Yes,jb6xv63,t1_jb6ww4f
The position we are in right now. At the end of the season what matters most is where we stand in the table.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6xi1t,t1_jb6ww4f
"Almost everyone gonna be pissed with them mocking rashford celebration, but it's not lack of class at all, we are rivals,  they shouldve take a piss out of us after trashing us, and vice versa. only thing we can do is be better and get our revenge next time",Manchester United,Yes,jb3f4qf,t1_jb3ehw2
"Tbh the only thing lacking class in that game was how some of our players behaved going down a few goals. 

Instead of using their heads they resorted to dumb fouls and Bruno had the trifecta of idiotic tackles, blatant diving and senselessly arguing for the ref.

Liverpool played well, sorted at will and celebrated. I have many problems with that 90 mins, all of them directed at United players and staff.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3itsk,t1_jb3ehw2
"Dont be.
Getting knocked around by your biggest rivals 7-0 and people thinking yeah its all good part of the process need their head wobbled.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6up8y,t1_jb6o4q9
"Don't be daft. This was an appalling result but if we end the season in the top three and with trophies, it's a successful season. Especially after the way things started.

Of course this game will factor into Ten Hag's squad building plans. Every game we play factors in, to some degree. How the players respond to this is even more important, and I hope they're not going through the same kind of histrionics as some fans. They've got to get back on the ball and win a game on Thursday.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6oqow,t1_jb6o4q9
">Weghost is shit, Anthony and Sancho are overrated and overpriced

Well that's just the painful truth, how long will it take people here to admit it? Weghorst is not a shit player overall, he's not, but an awful striker/CF. He only plays as a 10 because he's shit in his actual position.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4qnte,t1_jb4gar6
Saw one lad saying he's not watching United for the rest of the season. Might even be in this thread. Absolute whopper. No getting away from the horror show that was yesterday afternoon but this is the best season we've had in years. Why would you bin the rest of the season after one terrible result? We won a cup the previous Sunday FFS. I wonder how some people deal with real life problems.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4h51x,t1_jb4gar6
"Somethings are reactionary, while some aren't. People have been critical of these players even when we were winning but no one wanted to see that so they were down voted and the comments hidden.

It was the same when people tried to be critical of Ole during our good spells. The problems we saw yesterday didn't come out of thin air. 

We will most likely bounce back but there are still issues that need to be rectified.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4h59e,t1_jb4gar6
clicked on it and it made me realise how high quality our sub is.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3jzqk,t1_jb3fzkx
"Come on now, thrashing a rival is just too fun you forget the context of the season. Did we win the league the season we beat Arsenal 8-2? No, City did, but I’ll never forget that game.

As if we wouldn’t be having a party denting Liverpool’s hopes of a trophy and bringing them crashing down to earth.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3ig03,t1_jb3fzkx
Would be a massive overreaction to remove it based on one game.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3ya2j,t1_jb3xes1
"Definitely NO. We need a true captain with a cold head to boost our team's morale when we are losing, a true warrior.
Sadly Bruno is not that one",Manchester United,Yes,jb3xlrq,t1_jb3xes1
"Yes. One performance doesn't mean we strip him off the captaincy, heck we let Maguire have the captain armband for doing nothing when he comes on what makes u think Bruno will lose his captaincy based off one disastrous result where every person on pitch was responsible. If we count out this season, Bruno has been the most impact signing for our club so far.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3y0v2,t1_jb3xes1
Yeah. It will damage his confidence even more.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3xqtv,t1_jb3xes1
"If we're truly looking to move on from Bruno as captain, it has to be Varane I guess?",Manchester United,Yes,jb3xshw,t1_jb3xes1
It isn't an experiment it's a necessity. Ten Hag doesn't have options.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4783h,t1_jb46e7o
How does it matter anyway? He'll be back on the injury table after playing for 45 mins.,Manchester United,Yes,jb472k2,t1_jb46e7o
"Okay come on everyone rates EtH but obviously they'd shit on us for dropping 7 to our biggest rivals. No need to make up twisted theories to feel good about it. We were shit and we lost. All the players and the manager fucked up. Literally no positives. 

The rest I agree. Target was top 4 and a trophy for this season. On course for that. Need to finish strong now.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5j0la,t1_jb5grey
"We just completely lost our heads once they scored the second. They didn't even play amazingly, we just completely shit the bed. Also, I've never seen so many 50/50 balls end up bouncing straight to one team. ETH messed up the line up, subs didn't help, it was the worst second half performance I've ever seen. They had 8 shots on target, XG of 2.5 or something stupid. A few players could have been sent off. Bruno put his hands on an official (barely, but still did) so wouldn't be hugely surprised to see a ban.

All round, horrific day.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2zxtw,t1_jb2xjkj
Pep was getting called a fraud in his first season. He'd absolutely have got a lot of stick if he got beat 7-0. Maybe not on our level but that comes with being the biggest club in the country,Manchester United,Yes,jb5h1qi,t1_jb5ghuz
They have shown us with a trophy and 3rd position lol,Manchester United,Yes,jb50l48,t1_jb4zf4w
💪,Manchester United,Yes,jb50z8r,t1_jb4zf4w
"please someone enlighten me the bs about him as a ball-possession player, this guy won't do us any good anytime soon.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3ku98,t1_jb3hnmh
"Totally agree.
People still remember when we battered Arsenal 8-2 over a decade ago and in fact there's *even* a Wikipedia page dedicated to it:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C._8%E2%80%932_Arsenal_F.C.

What I really don't understand, and I wish someone could explain it to me, is why we have been battered so much in recent years?
We are now talking about multiple drubbings against Liverpool, and really unflattering results against Brighton, Brentford, Tottenham and I think Leicester too in the last couple of years.

I don't understand how Liverpool, even when they were an average team in the '90s and '00s never got thumped by us but this team allows it to happen multiple times!?",Manchester United,Yes,jb4mjnj,t1_jb4fg9b
He had less than a 50% pass accuracy that game too. Honestly shocking.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6vwtq,t1_jb6uecj
The mentality went down after we conceded a goal early in 2nd half.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6cgjw,t1_jb6bna0
Tale as old as time of the team doing their usual mental collapse as soon as 2/3-0 happened.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6fuu2,t1_jb6bna0
Mental collapse after 2-0 leading to terrible individual mistakes. Liverpool were also ruthless with their finishing and were winning every single second ball it felt like. Everything was bouncing their way.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6g2ue,t1_jb6bna0
Lost confidence + insane bad luck,Manchester United,Yes,jb6okfm,t1_jb6bna0
"Its pretty easy to be a good captain when everythings going well, as soon as the team really needed a leader on the pitch he preferred to act like a child. I like bruno, and i like his mentality but right now i believe the club needs someone far more level headed and commanding than what bruno provides",Manchester United,Yes,jb5wjz9,t1_jb5vdp6
"Thing is, when everything is looking good, its easy to look great. The true leaders, are the ones that step up when shit hits the fan. When we need him to step up when times are hard he is he first to fold. What example does that set.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5yydn,t1_jb5vdp6
"Hasn't so much ""fallen out"" as he was never in. He really should've had another loan. He still had trouble making an impact for the worst team in La Liga last season. We can't suddenly expect him to be a difference maker for a Champions League quality side, the difference in level is just too high",Manchester United,Yes,jb36f0l,t1_jb2w5w4
And why we continued to play so open after we were already 3/4 goals down at anfield.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3nnq2,t1_jb3nfk2
"I love eth and I think he's the best thing to happen to the club in a long, long time but to think he's blameless in this is naive. That being said, from what we've seen from him before i know he will learn from this and come back stronger.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3qgzg,t1_jb3nfk2
"Dude, Erik just won us a trophy last weekend. We had a bad bad day at the office. We will recover. We have to support him.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3o46f,t1_jb3nfk2
">My question to Ten Hag would be why Sabitzer didn't start instead of Fred

Ten Hag seems reluctant to drop players to the bench if they're playing well. Fred has been playing well so he's let him keep going. 

I don't think it can be disputed that Sabitzer is the better midfield player though, so hopefully this is the right time for him to start alongside Casemiro, and that will be the first choice pairing for the rest of the season.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4jqlm,t1_jb4jab5
"Fred starting is perfectly resonable, he stardted in both Barca and Newcastle games and was coming from best month under that shirt. 

My only concern with starting XI is why Dalot over AWB after that Newcastle game.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4ji0d,t1_jb4jab5
"I'm concerned about Antony.  I'm not as concerned about Bruno.  Roy Keane and Eric Cantina captained this club and behaved far more unprofessionally at times, but we forgave them.

Of course Bruno's attitude was questionable in the 2nd half, I'm still seething at the players, but in all honesty, in 20 years time I will still remember the defeat, but I don't think I will remember Bruno's part in the defeat.",Manchester United,Yes,jb57d7g,t1_jb54tas
Yesterdays game is a bad example. Was isolated up top by himself and no midfield to progress the ball to him.,Manchester United,Yes,jb38wqk,t1_jb3742e
Bruh did you watch him last season lmao. This season is a monumental improvement,Manchester United,Yes,jb3pwib,t1_jb3742e
You think we can get a result against Betis by resting the first team? They are much better than Southampton,Manchester United,Yes,jb3qn7y,t1_jb3pjle
"Kagawa didnt fit in. 

Mihkitaryan didnt fit in. 

Sancho 80m and 350k pw for a guy with physicality of an academy player who seem to not fix his unability to play 90 minutes even after being sent for invidual traning on continent.

"Gakpo plays on the left, Antony on the right.

That said, a competent DOF would have spent 80m much more wisely than on Antony.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3tnp3,t1_jb3scov
"You got downvoted for being positive? Here’s an upvote for not being depressing.

I know 7-0 is a horrendous result but if you’d have told me at the start of the season that we’d: 

- Beat Barca in the Europa League and be favourites to win it
- be comfortable in 3rd place 
- win a cup 
- be in contention for every cup available to us after the halfway mark
- Have a win and a loss vs Liverpool and City, even if the Etihad and Anfield games were embarrassing

I’d have snapped your hand off. 

The team and ETH are still miles ahead of where we were last season, but we shouldn’t expect them to be world beaters after not even a year of ETH. That’s ETHs first visit to Anfield, a lesson for him. The team are bouncing back better from bad results. Better to be behind them and remember we’re at the start of the process, not the end of it. When ETH first joined we were all saying we’d be happy with a trophy within 3 years and compete for top 4 this season. We’re ahead of schedule.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4dyb1,t1_jb4auyt
"The result taken in isolation, regardless of how the season ends, is unforgivable.

Losing 7-0 with 11 men on the pitch, with most of them mentally checked out after 3 goals, is indeed unforgivable.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3m3n7,t1_jb3lce1
"I think if you offered us at the start of the season would we take being battered 7-0 by Pool if we could finish 3rd in the League we’d have snapped your hand off for it. Gotta put it in perspective

Just worth ignoring the ridiculous theatrical media circus too. They did it when Arteta lost 3 on the bounce at the start of last season and they’re doing it again now. United Is massive and the more incendiary the headline the more eyeballs and the more revenue generated. It’s so transparent at this point.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3lw34,t1_jb3lce1
"Mate, he definitely got his tactics wrong, or at least not great. But not to the extent that it warrants a 7-0 defeat. 1-0 at half-time is a reflection of wrong tactics and defensive errors. He should have made a change just like he did in prior matches. But none of which should result in a 7-0 defeat.",Manchester United,Yes,jb45ohj,t1_jb44yrb
"I agree. Maybe it's because, in some ways it's harder to see exactly what he did wrong when the players played so badly",Manchester United,Yes,jb453al,t1_jb44yrb
"what are u talking about whole sub is criticizing him for getting his tactics wrong, wout as number 10 , bruno on wing rashford upfront just doesnt work.",Manchester United,Yes,jb452zh,t1_jb44yrb
Yeah Klopp got one over on him tactically but the 7-0 is because the players went to pieces. That's on them and not ETH.,Manchester United,Yes,jb45bfi,t1_jb44yrb
"Well he isn’t on the pitch playing is he? 
Those players had a collective brain fart fuck all he could do",Manchester United,Yes,jb454br,t1_jb44yrb
This result is 2000 % on the boss bad tactics and bad result,Manchester United,Yes,jb4572t,t1_jb44yrb
There's far more dead weight before Bruno to be sold.,Manchester United,Yes,jb486p4,t1_jb47h4p
"jesus christ whats wrong with people on this sub ? whats with bruno hate all of a sudden ? He is probably the only player who has performed most consistently in past years. You do realize that he is being played out of position to accomodate ten hag tactics right ? he has played 10, lw , rw. So a player adjusting for others so that they can flourish is at fault but not those who are supposed to perform because bruno adjusted for them ? damn talk about delusion",Manchester United,Yes,jb4808q,t1_jb47h4p
He is a good player but not a captain material. He is ok for now but we need someone who doesnt put his head down and whine when we are losing.,Manchester United,Yes,jb47wls,t1_jb47h4p
"He was played out of position and very frustrated. Doesn’t mean it warrants the behavior though. 

Still, bit far fetched to want him out no?",Manchester United,Yes,jb48qpf,t1_jb47h4p
"bruno cult ? i have been supporting this club for over 20 years lmao. U are delusional with ur one sided takes if someone has different opinion than urs doesnt mean they are in bruno cult, it just means they understand what player has given to the team so far and not judge them based off one bad disaster of result.",Manchester United,Yes,jb49o8z,t1_jb47h4p
By xGot De Gea should’ve saved 3-4 of those goals yesterday yet never got close. He’s the second most embarrassing performance behind Shaw,Manchester United,Yes,jb4lqoy,t1_jb4k3yq
"I think everyone knows ddg isn’t a modern gk.
That’s why we struggle starting the ball from the back.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4ktxy,t1_jb4k3yq
"Exactly, it was such a freak result. Like that 7-2 where Villa thrashed Liverpool. I fully expect us to come back next game.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4kpum,t1_jb4k3yq
Or perhaps they have been fine all season up until yesterday?,Manchester United,Yes,jb4c8oj,t1_jb4c4yb
"I think going on current form a lot of us were expecting AWB to start. And no one expected Bruno on the left with Wout at 10. The players gave up completely, but the tactics honestly were confusing for most of us",Manchester United,Yes,jb4lfu3,t1_jb4l79u
"Most of us expected AWB to start ahead of Dalot, don't try to pretend it was a hindsight thing. Dalot has been so bad since his injury, regularly getting hooked at half time.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4lu6y,t1_jb4l79u
The 2nd goal really killed the team mentally. And it was a very avoidable goal.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4br9w,t1_jb4ahdn
And a keeper,Manchester United,Yes,jb4lgsv,t1_jb4l4eq
"I mean I'm sure you're not saying this, but Eriksen wouldn't have prevented that slaughter",Manchester United,Yes,jb4nu8u,t1_jb4l4eq
"Several times yesterday he had the opportunity to take on a defender and run into space. And each time he either slowed down play or made a lazy pass. 

If that’s Salah he takes advantage of those moments. Obviously Salah is world class, but that’s what you want from your winger if you’re a top 4 side. 100mil for Antony was simply ridiculous.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5lwi8,t1_jb5kygy
"I don't see this anywhere. Everyone is raving about Liverpools finishing and saying United were very poor defensively, either of which won't happen in every game.",Manchester United,Yes,jb60ne5,t1_jb5yqf6
"I think it's clear to most people that Weghorst should score more. The dude tries wherever he's put on the pitch and hasn't missed a game since he joined. While we've had Martial, Antony and Sancho out for a while (and Eriksen/VDB) he's been very useful for giving us 11 players, an outlet in midfield, height at defensive set pieces and pressing opposition defenses.

I'm grateful for his efforts and so I won't knock him for what looks like a lack of ability/luck. It's not his fault Martial can't stay fit and start playing games",Manchester United,Yes,jb4c3vh,t1_jb49o1j
"Nah, disagree with this. They can be extremely tired and fatigued because of the game frequency, but that is not an excuse at all to ship 6 goals in a single half of football against our biggest rivals. This was a complete mental collapse, the likes of which we’ve seen 4-5 times the past 2 seasons. No other big 6 team collapses like this. We need to eliminate this mentality.

Still positive overall, we just know we have further to go than we thought last week.",Manchester United,Yes,jb404hh,t1_jb3zryy
"Im all for benching bruno,but who takes his spot. Eriksen and Donny are still injured",Manchester United,Yes,jb62b46,t1_jb61jmy
"He wwsnt even unproffesional main two acussations are false. 

He didnt push ref, he put hand on his back 

He didnt demand tor being subbed off.",Manchester United,Yes,jb61tld,t1_jb61jmy
did u watch that 1 vs 1 save against antonio in west ham game ? maguire and lindeloff got done and it was de gea who came off the line to save it 1 vs 1,Manchester United,Yes,jb4aybh,t1_jb4aqcu
"technically you are not allowed to touch them at all, not even light tap so yeah it's bookable offense",Manchester United,Yes,jb362iz,t1_jb35cff
"They just have a hate boner for anything Bruno, but theyd take him into their team if they could",Manchester United,Yes,jb35ys3,t1_jb35cff
"Those kids need to touch grass, calling that a push Jesus Christ",Manchester United,Yes,jb35s2v,t1_jb35cff
Bruno is the most hated player in the league they’ll get at him any chance they get,Manchester United,Yes,jb39cky,t1_jb35cff
They got thrashed 0-9 earlier this season by the Scousers man,Manchester United,Yes,jb41eu1,t1_jb40kfe
[removed],Manchester United,Yes,jb4ef3o,t1_jb4dy81
It was a problem. Only because we conceded 6 in the second half the first half looks better but during the game we looked weirdly unco-ordinated and Liverpool had like 70% possession. People were expecting the second half to be better and the rest is history,Manchester United,Yes,jb4e5hf,t1_jb4dy81
"Yes, we will, we will finish 3rd comfortably",Manchester United,Yes,jb4haxi,t1_jb4h3ek
"Yes. Yesterday's result is unacceptible but it's just one game, good for them and bad for us. They were shit for the most part of the season",Manchester United,Yes,jb4i0lj,t1_jb4h3ek
Yes.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4hthf,t1_jb4h3ek
"Liverpool won’t even get top 4. Yesterday was an absolute freak result. They’ll drop points against any team that sits in against them, just as they did against Palace last week.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4k1a8,t1_jb4h3ek
"I'm unsure currently..Think they have harder fixtures, but our fixture congestion won't be fun.. if Kane continues to carry Spurs it will be close whatever happens",Manchester United,Yes,jb4ji0u,t1_jb4h3ek

"Nice narrative that you constructed, he was literally the best player on the pitch against the League leaders of Spain",Manchester United,Yes,jb5qq3y,t1_jb5nory
I actually saw someone post yesterday that he was good in that game lmao. He was absolutely awful but because we won it got glossed over. He's been pretty poor recently in most games,Manchester United,Yes,jb5nzok,t1_jb5nory
ETH OUT! This form of 16W 3D 2L in all competitions post world cup is untenable!,Manchester United,Yes,jb58a2i,t1_jb56w47
"If it's a question of please substitute me because I'm going to get sent off and I've lost my head then that begs the question, why did you lose your head? You are an older established international and a captain of the team and you're setting the example and expectations on the pitch. He really should apologize.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2y78c,t1_jb2xoic
"Thats coach decision to play injuried player. 

Also it wasnt cofirmed by any reliable source",Manchester United,Yes,jb613mo,t1_jb606vp
"What are these standards you expect? I’m not defending the 7-0 loss in any way, I think it was humiliating and the players should be ashamed of themselves. But I also think in the long term we will be fine and fans need to stop being reactionary. I think this is our second loss since the World Cup of memory serves me right. It is not the end of the world and I trust Ten Hag and this team to bounce back. 

To answer your other question, Madrid did lose 5-0 to Barca in 2010, to that Pep Guardiola team. Again, I’m not comparing that Barca team to this Liverpool team or am I saying our 7-0 humiliation is okay. I am just saying there weren’t riots and resigning in Madrid and they were just fine after that humiliating defeat to a rival and so will we.

Edit - a few words",Manchester United,Yes,jb3x6ab,t1_jb3wb22
You act like there’s nothing to play for anymore. Let’s just all boo next home match huh?,Manchester United,Yes,jb3y1vi,t1_jb3wb22
You want ETH to resign?,Manchester United,Yes,jb3xulh,t1_jb3wb22
Shut up troll,Manchester United,Yes,jb41fck,t1_jb3wb22
"De Gea actually wrote and recorded a heavy metal song with his band for her about reflex leg saves.

She shared it on Twitter a few weeks back if you want to scroll through and give it a listen. 

It's pretty intense but the lyrics are beautiful if you understand German. I think it made the top 10 in Bosnia last week.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4zimd,t1_jb4y4sq
I'd take option A any day. We only drop 1 more point in that scenario compared to option B and have the second leg against Betis to win the tie. Sorry but I absolutely wouldn't take a 7-0 from LFC given a choice.,Manchester United,Yes,jb5dhhu,t1_jb5asmo
"I would take option A, the 3 draws, no question about that, even if it does mean 1 less point in the league, as it also means 2 less points for Liverpool, a blow to their CL hopes, and of course the big one, it avoids the most humiliating result in this club's 145 year history.

Fuck me, if I could, I would hand all the players medals back from last Sunday, I'd throw the trophy in the skip, and erase the record books if I thought it could wipe out yesterday's result.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5e7oa,t1_jb5asmo
You really think we stand a chance against Arsenal after all this?,Manchester United,Yes,jb3ubvf,t1_jb3nxsg
"You conveniently forgot the names of some of the worst offenders today - Casemiro, Varane and Martinez. They were diabolical. Are they perennial losers? Or what about ETH who had an absolute mare as well?

The entire team was shit today. Not just Bruno. Not just Shaw. Not just whichever individual you don’t like.

All of them. This team (as we’ve seen often this season) is capable of far more.

They are all at fault and all need to hold themselves accountable. Not scapegoating select players that’s part of the problem.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2z20r,t1_jb2wwsp
"warrra trophy, why do you want him back so bad??",Manchester United,Yes,jb3uade,t1_jb3teoi
Warra trophy for ogs,Manchester United,Yes,jb3ui2d,t1_jb3teoi
To be fair after a 7-0 drubbing some negative commentary is expected. Team needs to reset and make sure it doesn't impact rest of season. It was a shambles but a bigger shambles will be if it derails chase for more silverware and/or leads to spell of form where.pur top 4 finish comes under jeopardy,Manchester United,Yes,jb57kl1,t1_jb56vz0
Its literally second game his playing well.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6hhkj,t1_jb6gc6f
No. He looks really average.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6p77k,t1_jb6gc6f
I thought he’s looked underwhelming tbh,Manchester United,Yes,jb6x986,t1_jb6gc6f
to be fair to ten hag he did play few backups against west ham which clearly proved to be massive drop off in quality. Clearly they cant be trusted hence his key players have to keep playing week in week out,Manchester United,Yes,jb57b9d,t1_jb569pd
Name the 1-1 backup players,Manchester United,Yes,jb56lyd,t1_jb569pd
">Looking at how Arsenal and Liverpool fans hate us (personally i dont hate these clubs. these are rivals. Ofc i am not from England hence this stance) i sincerely support Man City for the title.

You don't think City fans hate us? Lol",Manchester United,Yes,jb47fm2,t1_jb46kz4
"Dude....if City win the title they will do a hat trick of PL titles something which is unique to us since no one has done it in the PL era, we have done it twice. Just like Arsenal have their unbeaten season, we have the hat tricks to set us up apart. Do you still want City to win it this season? Knowing very well Arsenal winning it this season wouldnt mean a lot. City winning it could mean they could go for a 4peat next season.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4871h,t1_jb46kz4
"I know what you mean but football is an escape for a lot of us with work life being bad/hectic, its the only real hobby/passion that some of us have. Results like this are really deflating and does have an impact on other aspects of our lives.",Manchester United,Yes,jb42d0x,t1_jb423tv
"I think this time is a little bit different. We had hope, we were on a good run, just won a league cup. Fans thought the team had transformed into something different. This game was a huge letdown, but yeah, it's just a football match afterall. I hope the team can bounce back in the coming game, don't know if it will lead to another disappointment tho. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",Manchester United,Yes,jb42ooi,t1_jb423tv
you're still dreaming,Manchester United,Yes,jb45x25,t1_jb459fk
He gets criticised by a vocal minority on here after every game lol,Manchester United,Yes,jb4y7l4,t1_jb4wwsg
"Yes it is an anomaly, we haven't been getting beat in games never mind 7-0. 

Show some resilience",Manchester United,Yes,jb4bl2m,t1_jb4b9u7
"Considering it’s our 3rd loss in 30 games yeah, it’s not a regular occurrence by any means. Also 7 goals from 2.9 xG is definitely an anomaly. We were abysmal yesterday, but it’s not indicative of how we’ve been all season especially since the WC.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4dbmn,t1_jb4b9u7
Well then I'd say he picked the worst possible match to throw and he should be fired.,Manchester United,Yes,jb54g3e,t1_jb53juy

"All the posters here who are desperately ready to nosh Qatari cock don’t seem to understand we can’t go out and spend 500 million in one window. The loopholes exploited by clubs like Chelsea are being closed. If we want a truly word class number 9 in the summer, we won’t be getting much else. 

Also, goldbridge is a tosser",Manchester United,Yes,jb4vgqn,t1_jb4unk1
You lost me at us not having comfortable wins since we signed Wout. Everything else lost credibility.,Manchester United,Yes,jb62k6w,t1_jb61kcj
"We needed a RWer, neither of those fill that hole.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4fr64,t1_jb4f9nm
Lol… before last few games for Liverpool it was the opposite way. Wouldn’t swap for any of them  at the moment nor I think Anthony was worth the  100m.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4fipi,t1_jb4f9nm

This season is nothing like that, we are more in control in the wins we have gained this season. Lol, every season some big clubs will underperform, honestly dont get this statement.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3bzvh,t1_jb37ib5
This is absolutely nothing like Ole’s 2nd season if that’s the similarity you’re going off. It’s useless drawing parallels as the context and relative situations are so different. A lot more structural positives than the entirety of Ole’s tenure this season as well imo.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3aalz,t1_jb37ib5
That is indeed dramatic,Manchester United,Yes,jb4zcc8,t1_jb4xwnj
"We re on the up bro, trust in ten hag but yanno what people can downvote me or what not we still got some deadwood we gotta get rid of and some players need upgrading. I think to go to the next level we need better than the likes of shaw, bruno and de gea. We re still 3 or 4 away from being a top team",Manchester United,Yes,jb4yf9u,t1_jb4xwnj
"We did beat both earlier on in season to be fair so 6 points from those fixtures isn't bad. The turnovers on the away fixtures were embarrassing though and yesterday has potential to define season of we don't respond 

Don't lose faith yet

Team is mentally fragile still but taking the season as a whole, it's clear we are better than last year and moving in correct direction. This was a setback (admittedly huge)",Manchester United,Yes,jb4yfz7,t1_jb4xwnj
"> What else did those pricks have to play for?

To beat and embarrass their biggest rival. Maybe we should try it sometime.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2wi11,t1_jb2vkz1
Top 4 is very much doable for Liverpool.,Manchester United,Yes,jb2w7yh,t1_jb2vkz1
"Fred is an absolute mystery to me. He can have a run of 3 good games that'll make people completely forget that he's had a run of 5 awful games. This pattern has followed him for his entire United career yet I'm just sat here the entire time thinking why don't we just replace this wildly inconsistent player?

You don't want wildcards in your team but especially not in central midfield

I wouldn't hold much hope though, a lot of this sub wants us to sign  Wout fucking Weghorst on a permanent deal. Mediocrity is a cultural issue among the fanbase",Manchester United,Yes,jb68r2z,t1_jb67jgi

I saw the entire first half n then after completing some work i started watching at 64th minute n saw it was 4-0 i was like wtf happened.

Then i saw darwin n salah score.

Then i was about to stop watching at 85th minute but decided to watch the full game instead n saw firmino's goal.

I started watching football last season i saw this club being battered by liverpool 5-0 n 4-0 last season then by brighton 4-0 last season but i decided to support this club because i like this fanbase n i relate to some level with the current squad (capable of great things but need some proper advice/direction). 

This is a wake up call for all ppl who support united we still nowhere close to being back.

This is arteta's 3rd season n only now arsenal r challenging for titles (even arteta said they should aim for top 4 realistically n next season they can be title challengers).

Let's give our bald fraud 2 seasons n after he gets his signings like a midfielders who don't give away the ball like fdj, pedri, bernardo, etc.

Imagine having that much talent and still not being able to keep your hands off your missus,Manchester United,Yes,jb3sxll,t1_jb2vz1w
You're not wrong. I fucking love Bruno but he's got pretty big flaws that stop him from being an elite leader of a player. Was hoping he'd grow into the captain's role and curb his god damn awful petulance the moment things don't go our way is infuriating but he was genuinely detrimental to team morale today.,Manchester United,Yes,jb34bgk,t1_jb337jh
"He's a quality player, and I hope he wins a whole bunch of stuff with us. But I've never been sold on him as captain (which is fine if you are, opinions are great). I just couldn't handle the dick eating surrounding him as captain. Here's to hoping today was enough to bring a bit of sense to his dickriders. Or here's to hoping he can grow a pair eventually",Manchester United,Yes,jb34c3k,t1_jb337jh
"This, plus it seems that he was gesturing to be subbed off at the dying moments. Of course, there is some justification that he might be knackered from playing too much, but asking to be subbed off to with this result as captain is some super weak mentality, almost cowardly. If you ask me, the armband should be given to Case.",Manchester United,Yes,jb35wsr,t1_jb337jh
"While I agree Bruno needs to stop whining so much, but to pin our big losses on him….  Correlation not equals causation.",Manchester United,Yes,jb33vnc,t1_jb337jh
Bruno just doesn't keep the ball and calm things down. Always going for that killer pass and giving the ball away. But he's still not the worst. We have so many who go missing during those games.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3j7m4,t1_jb337jh
"Bruno is one and De Gea is another. While he may not have made any mistakes, a statue in goal would have been more effective yesterday.

Schmeichel and VDS have had bad games, but their bottom level was still 5/10.

When De Gea has a bad game, it is often a zero or 1/10.",Manchester United,Yes,jb41sqj,t1_jb337jh
He is a flat-track bully like Sancho.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3p28t,t1_jb337jh
"Bruno lost his head completely, and its not the 1st or 5th time its happened.

He was whining and shouting a lot, he even pushed the assistant ref at some point. 

He needs to really calm down if he is going to be captain and lead us to success, or we need someone else as captain. He isn’t what we need as a leader if he continues to behave like this",Manchester United,Yes,jb4hdh1,t1_jb337jh
He's been captain everywhere he played. Give me that fire and intensity over the blank 1000 yard stare from Maguire any day.,Manchester United,Yes,jb5fgy8,t1_jb337jh
"People here were saying him and Varane were the best partnership in Europe and Shaw is the best leftback in the world. 

Of course going to get bantered when people are constantly preaching that nonsense.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3ojkm,t1_jb2vwqz
Mentality and quality. Antony and Sancho don’t score enough if at all these days. Not to mention Weghorst. Rashford has been carrying us real fucking hard and yesterday was a tough wake up call.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4u9zf,t1_jb4sos7
"Not going to matter when it comes to results like today. We could win the league and it wouldn't matter, we still got handed our worst loss ever (?) against our biggest rivals. Not going to live this down just by recouping some points.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2uhg3,t1_jb2t5a6
Nah people are not going to forget it easily. History shows it.,Manchester United,Yes,jb2ulhh,t1_jb2t5a6
American logic.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3oo2e,t1_jb2t5a6
"Not really. Even if it's a 5-0 victory on Thursday it won't mean anything. People need to stop deluding themselves. 

This loss will be remembered for the next few decades by rival fans. There's no way we will beat Liverpool 7-0 in the next 100 years either. SevenHag is a permanent nickname now.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3nz61,t1_jb2zq18
They don't deserve our support in that game. They need to earn it back after that disgrace,Manchester United,Yes,jb3c31y,t1_jb2yjcs
"Chelsea? Probably us in that 4-0 at the start of 19/20. Spurs? Hard to remember, i guess.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4qtj9,t1_jb4nqac
Spurs lost 4-1 to 16th Place Leicester recently.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4p60j,t1_jb4nqac
It’s very easy to defend him at the moment but I also noticed there was no overlap at all from Dalot. It might be because Antony stays so close to the touchline that there is no room for Dalot to overlap,Manchester United,Yes,jb3dvhc,t1_jb3coe1
"Somewhat surprisingly, it was probably just as many arsenal trolls as there were liverpool trolls.",Manchester United,Yes,jb557rj,t1_jb54jgf
True that is what I am saying and I am not here to single him out for that performance but I general even the games we were winning.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3rfrd,t1_jb3r0xc
"The absolute huffing of copium that was going on about Antony being incredible cos of the balance he provides on the RW and his defensive workrate was unrivalled. 

He is one of the most one footed players I have seen in my life. When you are doing outside the foot crosses with your left instead of naturally with your right there is something seriously wrong. His lack of pace is a serious issue too.

I am fairly sure he is just not going to be good enough. We will need to look at Amad or Sancho or buying another RW. Defenders took 20 games to figure him out and it’s only going to get harder for him from here.

Also for his defensive workrate, where was that yesterday? He was as bad as the rest of them if not worse.",Manchester United,Yes,jb608jq,t1_jb3r0xc
"Get a grip. Please explain to me how a borderline useless player manages to get 8 goals thus far, despite multiple injuries.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5g909,t1_jb3r0xc
"Someone will pay that for him and we should cash in without a second thought. 

I don’t want to make it out as he’s a scapegoat today - almost everyone was embarrassing and awful but the fact is we can’t rest some of our main midfielders because McTominay is so bloody awful. 3rd choice (4th choice when Eriksen comes back) box to box option, can’t play as a DM, not creative enough as a 10. He needs to go",Manchester United,Yes,jb3dbty,t1_jb3cweq
And they spent less. We should have a fucking badass team,Manchester United,Yes,jb39blg,t1_jb34ybu
Heck we could question Fergie on redcafe but here it's almost always a binary thing. Either you back the manager or you're against him.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3po7v,t1_jb3o6qn
That performance needs a fuckin leaf blower,Manchester United,Yes,jb4dmdn,t1_jb4dc4y
"He who has no hair cannot dry his hair, therefore will dry others’ hair.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4dfpd,t1_jb4dc4y
Plus they won through counterattacking. The losers.,Manchester United,Yes,jb2tzvz,t1_jb2tw9z
"Salah has had more bookings for taking his shirt off celebrating goals in Anfield, than United have goals there.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4eqsa,t1_jb4ec16
"His one-footedness is not an issue as much as the fact that his strong foot is not good enough.

Robben and Giggs were hilariously one-footed and it was never an issue because their left peg was world class and they could beat players for fun.

Antony can't complete a cross with his left foot and his tricks are utterly pointless.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3tlgr,t1_jb3tacf
"I get that. we cant all be physical specimens. But he has something else. He's Brazillian. We've seen he has tekkers. Use THAT. We saw how he tortured dan burn, just do that, and use it to get past your man",Manchester United,Yes,jb64eft,t1_jb6346p
"It's vital we get the win, if we get a draw or somehow lose, I'm worried it'll be the start of a run where we drop league points and narrow the gap with Liverpool. ETH was ruthless by dropping Ronaldo and Maguire so let's see what team he picks on Thursday because it's important he sends a message to the whole squad.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2tvji,t1_jb2sm3h
Tbh there was no good possible captaincy decision at the time really.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3fzau,t1_jb36q5i
"that's exactly type of behaviour that leads to burn out. also i'm not talking as in injury, cause i've never seen him injured, although he's been running less and less recently. i mean like when someone looks absolutely drained out. specifically in that west ham match, there were a few close shots were he looked like he's about to pass out any moment.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3ayhx,t1_jb38jn2
"> It's been 12 years and we still take the piss out of Arsenal for that 8-2.

yea its funny but also it really doesn't matter anymore does it lol. Especially if they win the league this year I doubt any of them will really care about it.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3e2fc,t1_jb3cflz
"Ehh, some will take the piss, sure, but that's football fandom. No one uses that Arsenal result to say that the team is shit now, do they? Eventually, it'll just be something you shake your head over and shrug and move on.

Of course, that's eventually. This week is going to suck.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3d4d3,t1_jb3cflz
"Will return back to this when season ends, if ten hag stops playing Bruno on wing I'm sure bruno will perform much better",Manchester United,Yes,jb4e6a1,t1_jb4dycm
"> Dalot and AWB are more than good enough.

No, they really are not. Not for a club like United.

This is Dalot's 5th season and AWB's 4th. Neither have been able to establish themselves yet. Both of them have very obvious weaknesses and have shown no sign of improving them. They are capable of going on 3-4 months of good form, but cannot sustain themselves beyond that.

They are both good enough to be back ups, nothing more.

>Keeper also is not a priority over positions like centre mid. 

It absolutely is. De Gea is not a world class keeper anymore, and the 99-05 years should tell you why we should not compromise in that position.

A world class keeper alone can make the difference between title winners and 4th place challengers.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4ey6e,t1_jb4et0s
"Dalot has had 4 good months in a United shirt, and even then he couldn't make a good cross to save his life. I'd say he deserves to be given another shot based on those 4 months, because he was really good, but I don't think it's necessarily true that he's an excellent player when healthy, because he's been pretty shit for 90% of his time here.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4hqrb,t1_jb4et0s
City had sagna and Zabaleta both better than dalot and AWB replaced with Walker and Danilo in the same window - that's the standard we need to better,Manchester United,Yes,jb4fqfr,t1_jb4et0s
"Some day Murphy's Law will work in our favor, I'll be patient till then.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4kjgr,t1_jb4kb15
"To be fair - Bruno is the most creative player in the league bar KDB

He has over 10 XA, but we’ve only scored 6 goals from those chances.

The next closest player to him is Trippier with 9, then Pascal Gross, Odegaard & TAA all on 7.5",Manchester United,Yes,jb6y60r,t1_jb6i4ro
I’ve noticed in several games that Weghorst would be sitting unguarded in the box begging for a cross in but would get nada. Maybe the players don’t think he’s a good enough striker but I’ve seen it happen when Rash plays CF too so I don’t think it’s entirely because of their rating of Weghorst. I’m surprised that more people don’t pick up on our lack of service to our strikers.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6tgy9,t1_jb6i4ro
We literally don't play the ball into the box half the time because our players don't rate Weghorst. You put a player like Kane or Osimhen and they're gonna get the ball a lot more,Manchester United,Yes,jb6o2ud,t1_jb6i4ro
They are also our best performing players,Manchester United,Yes,jb5jnpa,t1_jb5hjtd
"For me, it showed how little he knows them. Which is normal really, you can't see them in every scenario. He has seen them overcome a goal deficit to win several times. However, he hadn't seen them be quickly three goals down to a rival at a venue like Anfield. We did, we saw it last season. Now Erik has fully met our squad... which has apparently no gear other than ""SHIT THE BED"" after conceding 2-3.

But ye a lot seemed off. The weird corners... wtf was that? Why were we seemingly experimenting with set piece plays at Anfield? do they not know Weghorst has to duck air traffick, or that casemiro throws himself at everything he sees in the air? So why play short balls and do fuck all with them? It was so frustrating.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2x2nk,t1_jb2vkub
"‘Worked’ is a bit of a stretch considering we won the game after bruno was put back in the middle. Also we played much better in the second half after his substitution. 

Playing two players out of position to compensate for one isn’t a great excuse. Trent was literally there begging to be taken on and we put bruno up against him.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3w6u7,t1_jb3tgcb
Why would I stop this when he actually has been a flop?,Manchester United,Yes,jb4dxnd,t1_jb4dw8g
"He didn’t, though?",Manchester United,Yes,jb4dm9z,t1_jb4dg59
When?,Manchester United,Yes,jb4dr3o,t1_jb4dg59
"I don’t want to be critical of Antony or his price tag, but it’s weird I’ve never seen him beat a man on the ball",Manchester United,Yes,jb47aly,t1_jb469um
I have seen friends walk away without saying goodbye after a meaningless game of 5 a side football.,Manchester United,Yes,jb69vmn,t1_jb66xvl
Very interesting. What voice are they meant to use? The original celebrities voice before they became popular?,Manchester United,Yes,jb38cko,t1_jb387ow
"People are going on saying things like.. ""Well it's better than 7 1-0 defeats""

It fucking isn't, hand me that any day of the he week over a 7-0 drumming to our biggest rivals.",Manchester United,Yes,jb42fr1,t1_jb40wru
No they haven't and they're gonna win fuck all this season.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4oqtg,t1_jb4oa07
"PSxG has an average keeper conceding 4 yesterday, not 7. Liverpool had an xG of about 3 good finishing made it 4 and De Gea is responsible for turning that into 7. Poor finishing on our part cost us 1 basically. If we played that exact game again with an average goalkeeper we probably lose 3 or 4 - 1. Instead it's a historic loss not equalled since the 30s.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6epbe,t1_jb6705r
"I think you’re underestimating how crucial the keeper is to the way Ten Hag wants to play. ETH wants to use the keeper as an extra man to receive and give the ball, create attacks and overloads etc. the keeper being elite with their feet is absolutely fundamental to his system. The reason we don’t play how ETH wants is because De Gea can’t play out from the back / sweep to save his life. 

ETH is being pragmatic this season because he’s stuck with what we have but he will change things soon, just like Klopp and Pep did with their keepers when they arrived.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6jzf2,t1_jb6iy9r
100%. Still people will downvote you just because they are emotionally attached to the man and would never listen to any criticism of him even though we lost 7 fucking nil.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6dhii,t1_jb68uq0
"If I'm ETH, I would cut that highlight to 30mins and open to them before training everyday for a month. No need to say anything, make it a ritual.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3n07g,t1_jb2re0n
"This drained excuse has got to stop. As soon as we play badly people always bring it up. But no if we won today there would be no mention of it. People want us to compete on all fronts but bitch and moan that we play too many games. They're professional athletes for fuck sake, they should be fit enough to be playing the vast majority of games the season throws at them",Manchester United,Yes,jb2x7wv,t1_jb2re0n
"Ah yeah, torturing them is a much better idea",Manchester United,Yes,jb2rn3f,t1_jb2re0n
"Pelliestri cant beat a man, he showed this on his loan spell and is very limited footballer just like Anotny and cant even get on bench over Antony.

Players who dont play are always best here. Criticize Brazilian as much as you want but Facundo is not the solution",Manchester United,Yes,jb4dzi9,t1_jb4djjw
"100m euros. This was the 2022 highest summer transfer fee, and before Chelsea inflated the market with their overspending",Manchester United,Yes,jb4du3e,t1_jb4djop
"Liverpool signed Gakpo for 40m and Diaz for 45m, both are miles better than Antony, Sancho or Mudryk…",Manchester United,Yes,jb4dtab,t1_jb4djop
"Sancho has accomplished so much more than Antony and Mudryk. Even in limited minutes and appearances this year when he's largely come off the bench, he's averaging a goal contribution every 3 games.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4dx1t,t1_jb4djop
"Incorrect. The way we come back from this is to win titles.

Nothing else matters.",Manchester United,Yes,jb48c6l,t1_jb43dyy
"Aye, it wasn’t well judged. But you’ll equally see the same thing happen in almost every game and it’ll pass by unremarked, because it is unremarkable.

Shouldn’t have done it. Looks like a knob, but it’s not worthy of its own article. For it to be the top story today is a weird insight into how much attention we get from outside sources.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5lhkl,t1_jb5l4hp
Thankfully I think the referee actually accounted for the fact we were being humiliated and that our captain was taking it worse than anyone else .,Manchester United,Yes,jb5lq4c,t1_jb5l4hp
Was just as unprofessional from the linesman for allowing the Liverpool player to waste time in front of him and blocking Fernandes from trying to get the ball back.,Manchester United,Yes,jb68n40,t1_jb5l4hp
I think EtH should’ve rotated more in some games (like how he refused to rest our first team in the FA Cup vs Reading or how he refused to rest most of the first team for our 2nd leg vs Forest despite a 3-0 lead) but Casemiro had to play yesterday. I guess it depends on the extent of his injury tbf. But I am hesitant to criticise him for not dropping our best player of the season for the biggest game of the season,Manchester United,Yes,jb5vie9,t1_jb5uz0c
"Soften the blow yes, but this pain only goes away when we get to batter them the same way someday. Just hope it comes sooner than we expect.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4d18m,t1_jb4cft9
It will take time for us to forget this pain. Some people even feel like the season is already ended to them,Manchester United,Yes,jb3wi2u,t1_jb3w1ab
outperforming the xG by 4 goals is the definition of a freak result. Teams usually barely outperform their xG by double digits  throughout the whole season. Liverpool almost got half that just yesterday.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4ej6s,t1_jb4djxk
"Trust, can’t remember Antony actually dribbling past someone, the guy will just cut back and waste every single attack

Don’t think he’s even got an assist yet, his overall game is so deficient & having 1 foot makes him so so readable

Worst part is how he’s picked up 3-4 injuries already, availability is a cause of concern already",Manchester United,Yes,jb30xqn,t1_jb30bs7
I genuinely don't believe Antony is a 40m player. He's the type of player I'd expect Leeds to buy for 20m,Manchester United,Yes,jb4em6c,t1_jb4efpq
"I don't agree at all. He's 22, it's not like he's some youth player. All those problems OP mentioned have been there since the start of the season and it doesn't look like he's improving. Waiting too long to pass to Rashford yesterday is something he does all the time.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4i2n7,t1_jb4etrr
">Is he good enough to be our backup striker?

Nowhere near. And I'm not saying I don't like him. But a backup striker has to have some goals in him, it's a pretty basic requirement.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4314l,t1_jb4241i
"Man we need a DM in the summer so damn badly, it is literally essential. A young backup that can play in place of Case otherwise we’re gonna run him into the ground and he isn’t that young. 

McTominay not even in the same stratosphere quality-wise compared to what we need for our DM..literally the most important position on the pitch",Manchester United,Yes,jb3d9ep,t1_jb3cidb
"Problem with Weghorst as striker is he has 0 pace, their backline will play highline as we have seen so many times. When rashford plays there atleast there is threat of counterattack with long balls or special bruno pass. Wout Weghorst can't lead a counter attack even if his life depended on it.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3eoj8,t1_jb3cidb
I think Bruno is the main one he needs to rotate more. He's the most important player in the team but the guy needs a rest every now and then. Felt like Sabitzer should've started at the 10 against West Ham,Manchester United,Yes,jb6dk9l,t1_jb6am81
"If you mean Antony, I was thinking of the way people have a rigid idea of what a winger needs to be without seeing how well he fits Ten Hag's system. 

Setting aside yesterday when virtually everyone played poorly, he's been a very good presser and worked hard defensively. This gets overlooked as people still have a mindset that defence is the job of the back 5 plus a midfielder or two, even though it's becoming clearer every year that you need to defend with all 11 players to win trophies. He also keeps possession nearly every time, allowing us to escape pressure and sustain attacks. His long shooting has been a threat and he's scored some important goals. All of these abilities will become more and more valuable as the team's play improves.

He definitely needs to improve some aspects of his game, especially crossing and training up his right foot. What he definitely won't do is skin players like Saint-Maximin or Adama Traore or become one of our leading scorers, but people will keep slagging him off because they think every winger has to do those things.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5w6dh,t1_jb5qavd
"I'm just being consistent with Ten Hag's philosophy here. How a player responds in times like this, when the rest of the team has their heads down tells more about their mentality than all the times he has done well when the team as a whole have been hungry and passionate.

What message does it send when a captain puts up this performance (talking purely about attitude not about the quality of play) and doesn't face the consequences for it? What will it do to the mentality of the players the next time we find ourselves in a tough situation?

I'm not saying he isn't a great player, he's just not captain material, for now at least.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3po81,t1_jb3p6ok
To Glazers it’s 6 billion percent,Manchester United,Yes,jb4lr4k,t1_jb4lhci
"Okay, he's a good player. I'll give him that. How has he improved?",Manchester United,Yes,jb4uwdc,t1_jb4urqj
"I also think the same. It's a tactical decision. I remember a lot of games where our wide forwards didn't track back and normally stayed put in their forward positions.

The fourth goal was embarrassing nonetheless.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4xjna,t1_jb4wyr4

And like clockwork here's the Bruno exceptionalism. He was shit for basically the entire last season too. He's simply a wildly erratic player and will always be.

"He's dynamic but incredibly wasteful. Yes, he was a bright spark in a dark time, and he had a transformative effect on the team when he first arrived, but he's just not consistent enough to be a centrepiece for this team.

When he plays badly, he's absolutely terrible.",Manchester United,Yes,jb53384,t1_jb51pxu
"Tbf saying he's unbelievably overrated even at his best is not measured criticism, it smacks of someone who dislikes or has an agenda against a player. A measured criticism would be that while he's brilliant creatively, does put in a tremendous shift, and is rarely injured, he has a tendency to lose the plot in important matches which often costs us in those ""top six"" matches. He's been a little better for it this season but obviously reverted to his form and demeanor of last season on Sunday.",Manchester United,Yes,jb57kwl,t1_jb53ztg

"Bruno in the middle Garnacho on left and Rashy at 9.


Wasting Bruno on wings leaves our midfield of creativity as only Case is competent. 

Case left with Fred is only going to get fked as Weghorst runs like a fking stick. No poise, no grace. Whats worst is he fking useless in air despite his height.

Fred is highly inconsistent, short and was losing lots of 50-50s. Sabitzer has better passing IMO. Better in the air too perhaps.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3pp7c,t1_jb3pc7h
"Preach!

2 of our best players and one of our most potent player on the wings. Garnacho.

Weghorst needs to be used as a sub from now on or against power opposition. 

He creates a hell lot of problems for the value he provides.

Biggest issue I have is ETH over relying on him in matches where its clear he will have no impact. If this guy doesn’t do anything meaningful fin first 30, he will do jack shit the whole match.

It is not swiping them under the rug. I am accepting the defeat and moving on. Players need to do the same and fully focus on the next game.

Have you forgotten the mistake against Everton, where he was holding onto the post and forgot his bearings? 

What about Barcelona, when he was watching the ball enter the net? 

This is what you guys do, say “oh it’s not that bad, he made pretty saves against Leicester”",Manchester United,Yes,jb474ga,t1_jb46rys
"And how much should he paid for backup? He’s on 375k. You think he’d take 100k or 150k? 

We need a clean break, simple as.",Manchester United,Yes,jb46rn1,t1_jb46kdy
"Conceded 4 to Brentford, 6 to City and now 7 to Liverpool.

Some of theses players have been around long enough to be used to conceding more than 4 goals against Liverpool a season now. That’s concerning - it’s not a tactics thing, it’s a mental problem for some of those repeat offenders.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4ck9a,t1_jb49yyl
No one said we should forget. What really matters is how Ten Hag and our team react after the defeat. Winning Barcelona is a already a good sign for us. Look at the league table and look at how our team performs on the pitch is more important than one single humiliation. They can mock on our defeat but people should not over react .,Manchester United,Yes,jb3hnvh,t1_jb3h1x1
"the audacity to mention ""biggest club in the world"" after 7-0 lose",Manchester United,Yes,jb3v1n8,t1_jb3ush4
"I agree, and i hope ETH can get that sorted out.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5glxs,t1_jb5g8i1
Omg thank you 😂,Manchester United,Yes,jb726na,t1_jb6xv63
"Cheers, glad I'm not totally alone in feeling that way. I'm not going to be moping around for a week or anything, but I've found some of the perspectives here strange. The ""it's only 3 points"" stuff really has taken me aback, but then maybe it's generational or something.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6v6nf,t1_jb6up8y
"As I said, I'm not going to argue it'll be a successful season if we push on a bit more or that I've written off what has been done, but that result is a blight.

Right approach is being applied to refocus on the Betis match because there's no time to be moping around, but this one will live a long time in the memory. So my hope is Ten Hag puts the long term implications to the side and saves them for the summer, while learning his own short term lessons from a tactical perspective.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6qhwo,t1_jb6oqow
Lisandro Martinez for me,Manchester United,Yes,jb3zkqs,t1_jb3xshw
"Thanks.

The whole team better go for some 70km run to commemorate this poor display.",Manchester United,Yes,jb30qf5,t1_jb2zxtw
"That's the usual with him, unfortunately. We try not to pass to him and when we do, he kicks it away despite not being a good long passer.

Pretty sure he had 50% passing accuracy in one of the Barcelona matches as well.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6y8f0,t1_jb6vwtq
"I guess you never saw an Alaves game. 

Regardless, I’ve been saying for months that there’s got to be some other reason as to why he’s not playing. Antony has been given chance after chance and is pretty invisible.",Manchester United,Yes,jb37f76,t1_jb36f0l
"I don't think it's ridiculous to question the managers decisions as well as the player performances after a record equalling loss. Even more so when it comes 7 days after a trophy win. I don't think the OP is saying ETH should be sacked, just questioned.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3obo9,t1_jb3o46f
"You've got to ask questions. I do not believe in blind faith. This has happened 3 times now Brentford, City and now Liverpool. All signs point to this being something that can happen again. 17 goals conceded in 3 games is ridiculous. Not just a bad day in the office. Brighton beat this team like 3 times how did we concede 7?",Manchester United,Yes,jb3oh8t,t1_jb3o46f
done wanking over that mickey mouse trophy yet?,Manchester United,Yes,jb3sb5b,t1_jb3o46f
">I don't think it can be disputed that Sabitzer is the better midfield player though,

I'm disputing it. What has Sabitzer done to prove he's better than Fred? He may be, but there's zero proof so far. Fred, shit though he can be, has been a key player in some of our crucial wins this season.

The real answer is we need better midfielders than both of them as starters.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4kr56,t1_jb4jqlm
"When Casemiro is at his best then sure. However, he didn't seem fully fit yesterday so playing someone as chaotic as Fred next to him is a terrible idea.

I agree about AWB, should have started yesterday. We should have also played Rashford, Garnacho, Bruno and Antony/Sancho in attack and try to counter-attack instead of doing what we did, but things could have still worked out well the way we set up, we weren't far from scoring in the first half. Unfortunately, our midfield became non-existent in the second half of the game and we couldn't do anything since.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4kpap,t1_jb4ji0d
being an intimidating shithouser is one thing and acting like a spoilt little brat is another.,Manchester United,Yes,jb5915i,t1_jb57d7g
Where did I blame him for yesterday's result? He's had two disappointing seasons and we needed someone else to come on for Antony,Manchester United,Yes,jb4en39,t1_jb4ejhb
Its daily discusion so I think its overall about him and we just cant hide a fact that Sancho transfer didnt pay out as of yet.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4eqdq,t1_jb4ejhb
"Yesterday was not his fault, but overall he has been a disappointment.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4eo6p,t1_jb4ejhb
Hear hear!,Manchester United,Yes,jb4khy6,t1_jb4dyb1
Ok I agree with that. Maybe the perspective is lost on me.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3nf7u,t1_jb3m3n7
"I really see what you mean and I'm not saying this result is something that you should just dust off immediately. If we had the same result in the NLD id be fucking furious too.

But if you really put this in perspective like you said would you really rather have won the game and at the end of the season finished 5th or 6th? Of course theres still 12 games left but still.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3n0gx,t1_jb3lw34
"But that tactic worked pretty well until the Liverpool match. We beat Barcelona, Newcastle, and grind out results against other teams using that tactic.

There's only so much a tactic can do when players kept losing 50/50 and individual battles so easily.",Manchester United,Yes,jb45t36,t1_jb452zh
"Mixture of bad tactics, bad luck and mentality breakdown. Unfortunately no casemiro no party and he was clearly struggling with injury",Manchester United,Yes,jb45l6p,t1_jb4572t
"So he flops, whines, rolls around and throws tantrums because he's out it position. Hmm that's a new one. What about asking to be subbed? Is that because he's out of position too or because he wants to hide from the absolute thumping he's on the end of?",Manchester United,Yes,jb4ah2w,t1_jb4808q
"Its like kepa a couple seasons ago, he didn't make major howlers, the other team always just seemed to get lucky and score amazing goal after amazing goal against him. Turns out kepa was just shit that year and was doing all the basics wrong",Manchester United,Yes,jb4rxbm,t1_jb4lqoy
bruno was the worst one on pitch for me,Manchester United,Yes,jb4o90r,t1_jb4lqoy
"So why didn’t the goalie make a save. At least 3 goals were saveable. 

You’re saying it’s freak result. How many times have you conceded more than 5 with Ddg in the post.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4m6j4,t1_jb4kpum
"fine playing sure, but you cannot in good faith say that you haven't seen bruno lose his head multiple times through this season",Manchester United,Yes,jb4cehs,t1_jb4c8oj
We were also confused when mctominay came on instead of sabitzer,Manchester United,Yes,jb4v7eu,t1_jb4lu6y
"You try to play aggressive attacking football against an opponent that was ‘weaker’. In that case I 100% get the choice for Dalot, even when his form is not that great. Was it a gamble to play aggressive, yes? Was it unlogical, definitely not. Did it pay off, no? That is not a mistake but a risk taken and gotten wrong. 
You can’t just write Dalot of because he is not as good anymore since his injury. You have to give them some faith to recover. 

The problem of yesterday was not the line up. It was pure mentality.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4mvdc,t1_jb4lu6y
Also played on the left which people seem to be ignoring regarding his performance.,Manchester United,Yes,jb64mi9,t1_jb61tld
"So you are 100% fine with the way he acted yesterday? Our captain? Yes the main accusation was the sub and has proved to be BS, but come on, he was very annoying yesterday.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6dmbu,t1_jb61tld
Anulo mufa,Manchester United,Yes,jb4hth4,t1_jb4haxi
He literally fluffed every counter and chance he could,Manchester United,Yes,jb5opsp,t1_jb5nzok
I’m genuinely not sure if this comment is taking the piss or not lol,Manchester United,Yes,jb513m9,t1_jb4zimd
Yes,Manchester United,Yes,jb3w9jd,t1_jb3ubvf
"Casemiro looked like he was carrying injury or something, just didn't offer enough intensity and with Fred running around like a headless chicken next to him, we simply had no midfield.

In retrospect, if Casemiro wasn't okay then he shouldn't have started, but we don't have many options aside from him.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2zfqb,t1_jb2z20r
"Whilst everyone should hang their head in shame and have serious question marks asked about them, Casemiro and Varane have everything you can in the game and been at the elite level for many years. Martinez has been performing at a similar high level and won a decent amount for his age. All three pivotal in ending our trophy drought. The others though have either been nowhere near pivotal and/or been on the receiving end of performances like this many times. So when it comes down to making a statement and showing that this can't go on, sacrifices need to be made and the ones in the line of fire aren't going to be the three I've mentioned as at least they have a CV. 

So whilst I agree they are all at fault, certain ones have more damage on their record and they should be used to make am example, in times such as this.

Watching a video tape and a few harsh words isn't going to budge this rot. Ruthless removal and money will.",Manchester United,Yes,jb30w5z,t1_jb2z20r
do I?,Manchester United,Yes,jb3ufy2,t1_jb3uade
"Negative commentary is one thing.

Antony should be sold after this season.
Bruno needs to be shipped off.
Bruno shouldn't be captain.

All of this is bull shit.

And then there is this other section who are ""mentally broken and can't take it anymore"" after yesterday's loss. If a football game is taking such a toll on your mental health then probably you should introspect",Manchester United,Yes,jb5b7wf,t1_jb57kl1
First game. He's been mediocre at best.,Manchester United,Yes,jb72ln0,t1_jb6hhkj
"yeah, both of them do!",Manchester United,Yes,jb47pf5,t1_jb47fm2
I also don’t get fans who are happy with City winning the league because at this rate they will overtake us within the next 10 years.,Manchester United,Yes,jb49cxe,t1_jb4871h

for making worst record one after another?,Manchester United,Yes,jb3h533,t1_jb3gfge
"Ignore those types. Plastic fans anyway. 

We are having a remarkable season, over performing in every way. We got a taste of winning this year already & I think ETH has done such a good job, that many have forgotten just how good we are doing and they chalk it up to expectation. 

Reality is we were getting carried away. Thats a bloody good thing considering the doom and gloom from last season. Losing 7-0 is a disgusting defeat. I said before the game that the shoe is on the other foot almost, with how Liverpool are the ones with a desperate point to prove at home against the scarier team. The boys plainly werent ready to play that game and it showed with how they capitulated. 

Its a rocking defeat, but not a disaster. ETH will be livid, going through every single mistake and highlighting basically the entire match. It just wasnt good enough & the players know it. Now its up to them to either prove their own point, or stagnate and fall flat.",Manchester United,Yes,jb516ih,t1_jb4yfz7
"Pretty sure we beat them at OT, as well as Abu Dhabi FC?",Manchester United,Yes,jb2woly,t1_jb2wi11
"After today, them passing us in the table for 3rd is very doable. Hard to believe, but here we are.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2xjtv,t1_jb2w7yh
Great argument there.,Manchester United,Yes,jb89g9v,t1_jb4zo0y
"What's your point? There's a reason I listed him sixth. That's in the  bottom half of our best XI. He's had high highs and low lows, just as I would have expected. Just because I don't see a future for him in a title winning team doesn't mean I don't think he can play pretty well for a team that is fine finishing 10-15 points behind the title winner. Which is where we'll finish but nobody will be fine with it",Manchester United,Yes,jb5nglo,t1_jb5kp6l

“Toxic positivity” is an oxymoron,Manchester United,Yes,jb65l2h,t1_jb65bli

"I'd be shocked if you didn't want a single player in the squad gone

Wanting a player gone is having an agenda against them

Your agenda is ""we will be a better team if we sell and replace these players""

Again, that's how agendas work",Manchester United,Yes,jb5e8ii,t1_jb5e1f4
I just don't rate the guy. No different to the countless posters on here who don't rate Maguire or De Gea but Maguire has no defence force and De Gea has a dwindled one so nobody gets called an idiot or agenda driven for not rating them,Manchester United,Yes,jb5gmq6,t1_jb5fn4x
I hope he's available for betis,Manchester United,Yes,jb5f4n1,t1_jb5e3sm

But yeah it’s just football. Thanks for putting it in perspective 🙏",Manchester United,Yes,jb5uru4,t1_jb5s7ff
"Yep, he's just waving his hands at his teammates after his OWN mistakes. How are they meant to feel good about that. Then you say teammates shouting back at him because they clearly don't respect him as a leader",Manchester United,Yes,jb3517d,t1_jb34bgk
"Varane 

He was yelling at the squad for not saying goodbye to awayfans at the end of the game. 

He is a calm and composed. But ruthless when need me. Bruno is petulant. Casemiro prone to yellow cards.",Manchester United,Yes,jb40vkh,t1_jb35wsr
Did you see him completely giving up yesterday. He's also basically won nothing of note everywhere he's played,Manchester United,Yes,jb5grc0,t1_jb5fgy8
"Antony has managed 3 goals and 0 assists in the PL. That is abysmal, it would be abysmal if he was 30m let alone double that. You can't be a wide player who only shoots and score so little.",Manchester United,Yes,jb51ouu,t1_jb4u9zf
Nah IMO winning the league is kind of thing that resets that kind of banter.,Manchester United,Yes,jb44mzj,t1_jb2uhg3
Then they shouldn't forget all of our trophies either. Who cares what other supporters say or think?,Manchester United,Yes,jb5f2hy,t1_jb2ulhh
that’s not even in the same realm as losing to your biggest rivals by 7 goals,Manchester United,Yes,jb4ps4f,t1_jb4p60j

"Arsenal fans are rattled even from our shadow. I think people are over the moon because this is maybe the last time we are like this (with bad owners and needing investment on and off the pitch).

"Not surprising in the slightest tbh, that fanbase is the perfect marriage of terminally online and small-club mindset",Manchester United,Yes,jb55ha7,t1_jb557rj
Saw quite a few Newcastle fans personally. I guess that final loss still stings,Manchester United,Yes,jb592pl,t1_jb557rj
I have two very close friends who are Arsenal fans. Arsenal fans are cunts.,Manchester United,Yes,jb5ccm8,t1_jb557rj
"He has six goals but ok.

Six goals and an assist in 27 games, lmao. Gakpo joined in January and already has more league goals than Antony. 

Antony has also created just nine chances in the league. Total xA of 0.5. Zero completed crosses all season. Garnacho is 18 and in his first season, and has utterly outperformed him. Maybe you should get a grip and stop making excuses.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5j80d,t1_jb5g909
"Robben and Giggs were also two of the fastest players all time always ready to challenge the defenders. Antony just stands there, being one footed can only be excused when you are a truly special player such as Robben.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3txpc,t1_jb3tlgr
"All those flair brazilian players were physical spiecimens to be fair.

Even likes of Ronaldinho, Neymar they were fast and strong. You can have all technical ability in the world but if you are not fast and strong you are not beating your opponent. Sancho suffers from the same problem.",Manchester United,Yes,jb666w3,t1_jb64eft
"I know they were new signings but Varane or Casemiro, or tbh even DDG. He may not be vocal but he’s been at the club forever, is a nailed on starter and and surely has the respect of the squad. Bruno is not even in the top 10 for me.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3iz85,t1_jb3fzau
"We've seen it in the rare occasions where Martial has been fit, or when both Sancho and Antony have been fit, that Bruno still doesn't play in the 10.

But we'll see",Manchester United,Yes,jb4gepo,t1_jb4e6a1
Completely reactionary lol. Dalot in the first half of the season was second only to Trippier in terms of performance in the league. AWB post world cup has been brilliant. Good thing you're not in charge,Manchester United,Yes,jb4f3xg,t1_jb4ey6e
"Are you suggesting that Bruno being good excuses the rest from their creative responsibilities? 

All of Arsenal and City's wingers are creative on top of scoring goals.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6yijc,t1_jb6y60r
"So when Rashford or Ronaldo or Martial played there they didn't get rated either?

Cos this is for the whole season not just post world cup.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6ophe,t1_jb6o2ud
"Some are, some aren’t. The point is not that they’re not good players but when things get bad with them, they’re REALLY BAD.

These players have been a part of our humiliating defeats in the last few years. Obviously there is more but they didn’t play yesterday so I skipped them.

You have to look at the common denominators at some point and then it makes sense. 

Rashford stops running, head drops, never goes for 50/50 tackles or headers outside the box 

Fernandes starts complaining and diving, blaming his teammates and leaving his position 

McTominay starts clattering into people and getting yellows, spends rest of the game getting skipped past 

Shaw turns into drunk Buttner, becomes petulant on and off the ball, forgets how to mark and pass

Fred gets even more crazy and less strategic with his running, forgets any and all strategy 

De Gea retreats further and further into the goal to the point he’s standing inside of it, loses any presence in the box that he had in the first place, stops trying to make saves 


This list doesn’t include players that left obviously or players that didn’t play yesterday like AWB or Maguire.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5n6py,t1_jb5jnpa
"It was a mistake, but for whatever reason ETH decided he did not want to throw a 18 year old into the Anfield cauldron, and Sancho picked a lovely time to fall sick again. 

If ETH had a fit Martial and Sancho, and did what he did, I would be pissed.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3y0ez,t1_jb3w6u7
Stop acting like it's not been okay to call him out... he's been getting shit on from day 1,Manchester United,Yes,jb4e1c6,t1_jb4dxnd
"It depends. It’s all about what the marketing department (or whomever did the outsourced hiring) wants. Often times, tweets are actually pre-prepared and approved so that they fire off at the right time or outcome.",Manchester United,Yes,jb38oq6,t1_jb38cko
Sorry mate I’m a big United fan but Liverpool have definitely won the most trophies,Manchester United,Yes,jb4ovcn,t1_jb4oqtg
"never said it was an excuse, but it clearly all just capitulated and boiled over tonight",Manchester United,Yes,jb35o76,t1_jb2x7wv
can’t be any worse than them torturing us with their pathetic excuse of a performance,Manchester United,Yes,jb2rqty,t1_jb2rn3f
"Antony hasn't showed that he's better than Pellistri so far. We can't counter with him, he doesn't have the ability to play first time passes if he's not on his favored leg and under no pressure. Most of the time he just passes back into midfield. I'd rather give Sancho, Pellistri or even Garnacho a chance at the RW before Antony right now. Yes I'm probably being very irrational but something has got to change, once teams mark Rashford out of the game we aren't scoring.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4eif5,t1_jb4dzi9
Yesterday aside Gakpo has not been great,Manchester United,Yes,jb4ed91,t1_jb4dtab
"Mate, don't drag Sancho in. He has been very good after he cane back for one. Secondly, he actually is a proper player who has performed in the Bundesliga (one of the top leagues and the CL)",Manchester United,Yes,jb4dz3i,t1_jb4dtab
And he plays more as a playmaker than a forward. So those are great numbers.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4e6l7,t1_jb4dx1t
"And yet he still didnt play good game of football from 1st minute and it looks like 3 months of invidual training didnt fix his physicality problem as he is getting outmuscled and outpaced every time.

I think its fine to criticise Sancho.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4e9a6,t1_jb4dx1t
"We can win the next 20 league titles, this will still haunt us.",Manchester United,Yes,jb48ke6,t1_jb48c6l
"He's still young in a new league and not even had a full year in the team, when you pay 90mill you aren't necessarily looking for an instant impact it's a long term investment and he already has 8 goals and 3 assists in his first season.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4jjga,t1_jb4i2n7
"I don't care if he can't skin players.

90% of the attacks that go down his side end up in a poor shot.

His defensive work rate is not even elite. He's about average in that in all the metrics, Tackles, Interceptions, Blocks etc are all under the 50th percentile.

Here are the things that he is the WORST in the league at (2nd to 10th percentile).

Fouls won, Key passes, Assists, XAG ,Goal creating actions, crossing into the box.

He needs to improve a lot and fast at a lot of things because its not even average at this point.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5zz3y,t1_jb5w6dh
His defensive contribution is just one part. He can hold down the right side on his own and stretch play which allows for quick switch of plays. It works really well when Bruno is in the middle.,Manchester United,Yes,jb62ygg,t1_jb5w6dh
"Shit happens, u whine and blame but u don't strip someone off for one game performance. U have to consider what they have done here so far as well. Ten hag is type of manager who won't throw anyone under the bus in public but I'm sure behind scenes he is tearing each of them apart. This loss isn't just on Bruno every player on the field had one of their worst performances. Bruno is the captain yeah, but there were 10 other on the field who also held their head down instead of fighting back, they are all grown men under same coach are we expecting Bruno to babysit them?",Manchester United,Yes,jb3q300,t1_jb3po81
Wasn't answering that part of your comment.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4uznx,t1_jb4uwdc

Kulu : 8GA in 24

"You've misinterpreted this a lot. I'm basically saying that it was obvious that we weren't ready to challenge yet as a top level team mentally. It's not about what I was expecting to come out of this, it's about how I knew that we shouldn't of got ahead of ourselves too early.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6bz1f,t1_jb6bp3t
He had a bad game yesterday but are you saying he has been shit this season as well?,Manchester United,Yes,jb58937,t1_jb54tt9
"He literally plays 90+ minutes every few days, every other player gets subbed or gets games off. How is it stupid to expect poor performances if this continues",Manchester United,Yes,jb54u5m,t1_jb53m16
"I like him, I don’t really get angry either way, I don’t mind him trying 19 shite things because he WILL inevitably produce that 20th amazing thing, and I think some of the complaints about his “antics” can be overblown (and are things 90% of players regularly get up to). 

all that being said he was absolutely the worst version of himself yesterday",Manchester United,Yes,jb54zum,t1_jb53384
I think you summed it up perfectly mate. I think if we re to go to the next level i think we have to upgrade on bruno,Manchester United,Yes,jb54r4h,t1_jb53384

That's an example of toxic positivity

Here's a definition of toxic positivity:

>Toxic positivity is the pressure to only display positive emotions, suppressing any negative emotions, feelings, reactions, or experiences. It invalidates human experience and can lead to trauma, isolation, and unhealthy coping mechanisms.

"Right, yeah, he should improve on his crossing which would yield assists, expected assists and a couple of the other ones you mentioned.

Individual stats on the defensive side that focus on duels don't give the full picture imo. Otherwise Ibrahim Sangaré would be a world beater.

The captain needs to be held to a higher standard when it comes to attitude and mentality. I am not expecting him to babysit anyone, but I am expecting him to lead by example.

He's been awful for weeks at this point. Regularly our worst player on the pitch. Obviously he's got ability so he's always going to be able to string together some good form but due to his brain he's always going to be erratic and will have plenty of poor form like this recent run because of it unless the team is built around him. The only football he suits is counter attacking where his Hollywood balls are less wasteful because we've built our team around just soaking up pressure rather than trying to control a game.

"And if people actually watch games (most of this sub doesn't, as they are too busy posting in match threads to see what's happening in the game) they'd notice that even in minute 90 of most matches he's the one running like a dog even if the game is won. He's rarely subbed, he never gets a rest. Of course, none of that excuses his behavior, which IMO is a far bigger issue than his performance.

"At his best he gets around a goal or assist every game. And its not just numbers, at his best he's genuinely the creative hub of the team. 

If you think that is unbelievably overrated, then you are an idiot or have an agenda against the guy. These are your words, you didn't say he's unreliably overrated, you said even at his best he's unbelievably overrated when that is just not true. 

At his best he's as creative and impactful as any attacking midfielder in the world. 

Was he at that level last season? Obviously not. Has he gotten closer this season? At times, but still not at that peak. Also I'd say this season part of the issue is that no one finishes the chances he creates, except Rashford. But then again no one has really called Bruno world class since that initial spell he had when he was insane. Even if he's praised there's usually a caveat.

As for ETH playing him wide, it has nothing to do with him being good or not. Steven Gerrard was played at RW and then as a second striker by Benitez. Was he not world class either because he wouldn't play his favorite CM position?

Truth is that he comes across as a petulant idiot when things don't go his way, so he's easy to dislike and blame when the entire team is not doing well. I was unhappy with his attitude in the game, but he's not the reason we lost 7-0.

"Stopped reading when you called me an idiot tbh. Yeah I do have an agenda against the guy. I want him out of the team so my agenda of seeing United back at the top is fulfilled, just like I'm sure you have your agenda against certain players",Manchester United,Yes,jb5bxlc,t1_jb5az6l

"Ngl I agree. I was with keeping De Gea but yesterday was embarrassing point blank. Other keepers will at least drop a crazy performance to keep the scoreline not embarrassing. Even if he kept out 2/7 of those shots it would be less embarrassing at 5-0. 7-0 with 8 shots on target is ridiculous. How many times do we go to a team, and beat them 2-0 or 3-0 and think that could be 5-0 or 6-0 if it wasn't for the keeper. Feel like that barely happens for us.",Manchester United,Yes,jb47w46,t1_jb47ave

Real fans get upset they get mad but we also focus on the change under ten hag and can see the improvement which he has brought compared to past managers post saf.

My point here is if u are brining in a keeper he needs to be better than de gea at his current form, A world class keeper wont come cheap and we have much biggter priorities than a kepper. we need a striker, backup for eriksen, bruno.

I know it's a taboo to most fans to criticize bruno in any way, but with us 3goals down with 36minutes left to play, I looked for our captain to be going around calming his teammates down, reminding them that losing here wasn't the end of our season, but he was leading the petulant frustration brigade. Throwing himself on the ground at any opportunity he got. Whining non stop to the refs, half hearted attempts to at least keep up with his man. His head was completely gone and he was petulantly half-arsing it. This hurt me. Few mins later, rashford following the footsteps of the captain couldn't even be bothered to sprint 5yards to put pressure on henderson steadying himself for a cross. Ofcourse henderson crossed unchallenged and darwin nunez got his second goal. These actions hurt me more than the result. Bruno when we needed leaders was the most childish player out there on the pitch. We could have lost this game but still maintained some level of dignity if the players didn't completely lose their heads out there and bruno who was supposed to be our captain was the greatest culprit.

Heavy reassessment and then bounce back ASAP. Looking further ahead, recruitment this summer will be interesting. We lack important profiles (in midfield esp.) for the 1st/2nd phase of games, as well a metronome that can help us control games and sustain possession.

It’ll be tricky with Shaw and Malacia ahead in the pecking order, and (I think) he’s on a sizeable pay package around the 100 mark, but he has a lovely left boot. Equally, I don’t think he’s positionally any worse than our current LBs. 

Guess it depends if we get a good offer, if he is prepared to accept less game time, or even if ETH can see him in a couple of different positions to make up for the LB competition (perhaps CB in a two or three, or as an auxiliary traditional left winger).

"I could point the finger at everyone today, but nothing has changed, still need a GK, a RB, a midfielder and a striker this summer.

DDG is NOT a legend, never will be. 
Absolutely fucking NEVER.  Half the goalkeeper Schmeichel was.  Schmeichel was a MAN, physically and mentally, he was brave, he was strong, he shouted, he led, he commanded, he took no prisoners.  DDG on the other hand is a... in fact I won't even say what he is as I'm just too angry.

Seeing the same frailties from the RB position as we always do when we get a hiding.  And I'm sure someone will pipe up and say ""well AWB should have played""... fuck that, he's not good enough either, when it matters like against Arsenal he was absolutely shite and does not belong at this level, never will.  Yeah, you can make do with Dalot and AWB when you're playing the Palaces and the Forests of the world, but not at this level.  It will come back to bite us over and over again.

But they weren't even the worst performers today, Luke Shaw looked like he gave up, Casemiro and Bruno were awful but have enough credit in the bank for me not to go in too hard on them today.  Well I could go on, and I don't understand how we're still getting caught on the break when we're 4-0, 5-0, 6-0 and 7-0 down.  You batten down the fucking hatches at this stage.

"I posted this a week ago and you all thought our fullbacks options were adequate, comment was on -11. 

""I said on here about 2 months ago now we should be looking at a RB.

Wan is playing well atm, but has serious limitations in attack that Ten Hag can never fix only improve. 

Dalot is frustrating, can't find any consistency, always one good thing followed by one bad thing, we switch between the two because none truly offer what we need.

Please don't tell me, 'Dalot has improved and is now worthy', as a man who has watched football for a long time i can tell you when Rafinia joined Leeds many were saying his good he was, (surprised we didn't sign him), THAT, is the level up that we as fans should be acknowledging.

A world class RB will very much show you and potentially the new generation how much this position can be improved, I feel like the new fans see what our RB's are doing and don't realise this position for United has historically had some of the best players we've ever had that change games on their own. 

Wan and Dalot are good players, but both are nowhere near what I would class as a world class  game changing RB. Its time to level up this position.""

"The march thread was so toxic. Could we have some perspective please? 

It was an off day, I don't think ETH got his tactical setup **completely** wrong because on balance we actually had the better chances in the first half. 

However in the second half I think he waited too long to react, and eventually we couldn't stem the tide any more. That's on him, no excuses there.

The players did drop their heads but frankly I can't find the heart to blame them **too** much  - they've navigated a long and arduous season extremely well (and with such a great attitude too), and it wasn't until they probably felt a result was beyond them before they threw in the towel mentally. Anyone who's ever been involved in any sport has probably felt the same way at some point. 

Liverpool were extremely motivated to beat us because what else can they play for? Especially Gakpo - he looked like he had an axe to grind, and fair play to him. 

The weather was a huge factor too I think. The soggy pitch really hampered our usual quick passing style & effectively destroyed our counter-attacking hopes (though again, ETH should've tried something different). Also the resultant deflections were absolutely ridiculous. I can't believe how much luck Liverpool had for the ball to fall their way so many times. Just absurd. 

We were due to lose a match, and all things considered this was the best competition to get a loss in. It really sucks that it had to be to Liverpool but better to lose at Anfield than to a more beatable team at Old Trafford.

I'm more than hopeful that the team can bounce back because they did it earlier this season already, and the spirit in the squad is clearly better than it's ever been for the better part of 7-8 years.

I would hate to see him go to Real 5-6 years from now and give them his best years, just like a certain someone. I have always thought selling Ronaldo to a club like Real was a massive mistake since it propelled them to glories that set them apart. Real is still enjoying the domino effects of those successes until now imo because it makes them more attractive to players and it generated tons of money for them on and off the field. Basically we nurtured and developed Ronaldo for them. Tottenham did the same with Modric and Bale for Real. Maybe it can’t be helped that Ronaldo is Portuguese and Garnacho is Argentinian but this is a problem no matter how you look at it, albeit a long-term one.

This is one positive I got out of ETH (and also quite concerning too).

Our rivalry was only because we were the best teams in the world, with the two of the best PL managers of all time, with some of the best PL players of all time. The things both our clubs did in those years is the stuff of legends. It's only natural our rivalry was intense. Similar to your rivalry with Liverpool. Liverpool United Arsenal are the OG giants.

And we know what we did to be the best. We got our success organically, buying prospects and developing players and then Chelsea followed by City and bought ready made players with fuck you money. 

So I really can't support City winning over anyone else because of what they represent. That you can buy success, and if you can buy success it doesn't matter who you hurt along the way, and i'm not taking about other clubs or players i'm talking about their owners.

"I don't care what you think. I've been a Utd fan for 30 years and I've got a lot of respect for Arsenal. A well run club with a long, proper history and identity just like us.

Our rivalry in the past was absolutely legendary and I am all for a Utd v Arsenal renaissance. Utd vs Arsenal when both teams are at full power is way more interesting than City and Chelsea. The Prem is just better off all around with a strong Utd and Arsenal team.

They have been in the wilderness just like us and our coming through the other side just like us. If you don't respect that than you're an idiot.",Manchester United,Yes,jayqco4,t1_jayk3pp
"In all due respect, are you mental? 

I think we can all agree that we’d all want United to somehow win the league but, if we have to choose between arsenal and city, surely it’s a no brainer…? 

I dislike Arsenal as much as the next guy but, at the end of the day, they’re a good team that did things the “right” way. They’ve not got the budget of city and they have a young team with a manager that they stuck with…
I grew up with the United vs arsenal rivalry, but neither of us have been pulling up trees for a long time prior to this season. I don’t spend much time on social media (other than checking here for news), so I couldn’t give a monkeys how vocal a bunch of arsenal supporters are that I’ve never met.

The alternative is City (our actual rivals, albeit not so loud when they were relying on Shawn goater every week) equaling our threepeat and continuing their domestic dominance. 

Before anyone says “city don’t count, they’re state owned”, just be aware of what is likely to happen in the near future (I know that we don’t need the money like city did, but I assume that rival fans won’t care). 

It’s been so long since arsenal were last relevant, that this is almost akin to when Leicester had their one-off league win. 

If, after taking the above into account, you still prefer city than arsenal, that’s your choice… but I certainly don’t think it’s fair to call out fans that may prefer Arsenal to City, given the context.",Manchester United,Yes,jayq5s5,t1_jayk3pp

"You could argue Bruno’s performances over recent games has regressed. I thought he had an abysmal game against Newcastle and he struggled against West Ham as well.

Of course it’s an asset to have a player with his determination and willingness to constantly play. But nothing seems to be coming off for him at the moment.",Manchester United,Yes,jb091bu,t1_jazv6rb
So far Sancho hasn't justified or looked like he can step into that role. Goes missing too much. He's not a very proactive player and I think you need to be in order to play at 10,Manchester United,Yes,jb0849r,t1_jazv6rb

Yeah there is no way we should be removing one of our most vital players from the midfield.

Yeah thats what I do not get. Its one thing if we were drawing and losing games all this while. What the fuck happened tbh. It wasn’t like our player was sent off and we played with 10 players.

"I'm upset too but to be fair to them, they've also responded well to going behind between the City game and now. The early second-half goal against Leeds was the only real shocker I remember and even then, the reaction was admirable. Today was woeful but not characteristic of United since the early collapses.

"Its just a painful defeat that would stuck in our mind for the rest of the season. But a defeat like this would always be a blessing in disguise for a team with right mentality. Don't forget that our main priority for EPL is to secure top 4 which we firmly install ourselves there now.

He’s played in goal for some of our worst defeats in history over the last few seasons. He gets zero free passes. He does not deserve a new contrast on 250k a week,Manchester United,Yes,jb24w6a,t1_jb23mi4
"His distribution was genuinely terrible today. He completed less than 50% of his passes and that puts so much pressure on our back line and we couldn’t win the 2nd balls for his hoofs up the pitch today either. They had chance after chance because of that today.

Also as long as he’s been here he’s been terrible at his near post and nothing has changed. 

Ten Hag will be wanting to move on in the summer",Manchester United,Yes,jb2f26h,t1_jb23mi4
"Good point, but then for me januzaj is the warning of relying on talent breaking out too much.

Fergie did it absolutely right holding Ronaldo back when he was younger and I'm glad ETH is keeping garnacho on the bench a lot despite how well he is playing.

I'm convinced teams relying on teens raw talent starting them week in and out from the age of 17 onwards leads.to players careers ending early like Rooney or chronic injury problems like Phil Jones.

"Not too nervous... but I think it'll be a hard fight.

"Nope.   So you get champions league for finishing top 4, or for winning the CL or Europa League.    If you win one of the cups and finish in the top 4, then that extra spot is forfeit rather than passed down the ladder (which used to happen).  

If you win a cup and finish outside of the top 4, then England would get 5 teams into the champions league next season.      

However a country can have a maximum of 5 teams in the champions league.  So if 2 english clubs won the CL and Europa but both finished outside the top 4, then only the top 3 would qualify.    4th place would become a Europa qualification.",Manchester United,Yes,jazelwb,t1_jaz9qgm
No. Only time a team outside of top4 gets CL is if they win the EL or CL,Manchester United,Yes,jazak0l,t1_jaz9qgm

"Nah, Liverpool are starting their transition. Firminho leaving. Salah will be gone soon too. They know they’re in for a few tough years. I have my doubts about Klopp sticking around too.

"Agreed. Mentality is a buzzword but you will never catch any other so called top side collapsing to their rivals in a game like this. It does indicate that there is something more seriously wrong than we thought, and even with the new players the same mentality can exist amongst the team. Don’t want to exaggerate but it is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with. Winning trophies will definitely help, however.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2c644,t1_jb24k2g
Eh. The title is hyperbolic but reading the article it wasn’t too bad. Our resurgence has been put on temporary hold. Just proves to the players and ETH that there is a lot of work needing to be done until we can consider ourselves a top side.,Manchester United,Yes,jb2bryk,t1_jb26vw8
"Yep. Realistically the only major repercussion from this will be Pool fans taking the piss and the potential for it to derail the tail end of our season. We’ve responded to losses well once before at the start of the season, we can do it again.

"Such a backwards argument. I'm not defending the way Britain acted in the 1800's but how can you say oh well you guys used to invade and pillage countries and disregard human rights so fuck it, why does it matter if other countries do it now?

The fact is the world has moved on in a huge amount of areas and Qatar should absolutely not be treating migrant workers the way they do, basically modern day slavery. Also their LGBTQ outlook and laws are horrific. You're born gay just as much as you are born black or white. Trying to oppress people on those grounds is a horrendous way to govern no matter what some old books say.",Manchester United,Yes,jazys6g,t1_jazy3te
"The UK state (ie, the people who perpetrated those atrocities) aren't the people criticising Qatar though are they. It's regular people who aren't guilty of those atrocities and don't approve of those atrocities that are criticising Qatar. If regular citizens are guilty of the crimes of their countries (past or present) then I really hope your country has a clean conscience.

This flimsy whataboutism doesn't somehow make Qatar any less of a human rights abuser. Especially given that they currently are actively perpetrating those human rights abuses rather than having done so decades or centuries before which is the case you're levelling at the UK.",Manchester United,Yes,jb06592,t1_jazy3te

"The British caused a genocide in my country(India) and millions of people lost their lives in the Bengal famine. The effects of this are still felt today in our(south Asian) genetics we accumulate fat in our belly rather than around the body.

However I don’t believe the owners of Manchester United nor the players or fans had anything to do with it at that time. I really don’t know the extent of Qatars involvement in shady issues though. The migrant worker issue is not as black and white as people make out to be. I’ve seen complaints that the migrant workers had terrible living conditions and western media were gawking over the condition of the restrooms. The thing is living conditions in most of India where these migrant workers are from are perhaps worse. The money you make by going to Qatar is significantly more than what you would make in India as a construction worker.
 
If western people really wanted to virtue signal they should vote for politicizes that allow more migrant south Asians in.

A little bit of perspective. When I was growing up the kid with all the fancy toys was someone who’s father used to work in Qatar as a construction manager. So what I’m saying is it’s not black or white as what people like John Oliver want you to believe.",Manchester United,Yes,jb0bgfg,t1_jazy3te
"""Great"" Britain is a reference to the land mass, not implying awesomeness.

"I agree - people say “oh well it happened ages ago and we have nothing to do with it now”, yet such countries continue to reap the generational wealths and benefits that centuries of pillaging and violence brought them.

If you’re going to point fingers and say you can’t do this and that, then you have to acknowledge the fact that you are still benefitting from the atrocities committed in the past and most importantly, relinquish such benefits. Otherwise it’s all just talk. It’s like someone robbing a bank 10 years ago and enjoying all the stolen money and passing it down to future generations whilst having the audacity to say that others can’t do it.

But of course, no country is going to willingly cripple their country because morality has always taken the back seat.

Countries like Qatar are doing what they think is necessary to play catch-up to countries like the US and UK. None of that is to say that the atrocities committed in places like Qatar are to be excused. Slavery should not exist today nor should it have ever existed in the past.

All I am saying is that just because a country is committing atrocities now does not make them any more evil than countries that did it in the past. They’re all just as bad as each other.",Manchester United,Yes,jb0jzhy,t1_jazy3te

"I was most surprised about how poor Casemiro was. Wasn’t effectively shielding the defence, tackling was slow and poor range of passing too. I’m sure he’ll be great next game but I was shocked to see that, admittedly he wasn’t getting much help and was getting overrun in midfield.

As for whether the boys have earned our trust, well the way I see it is there are several players who need replacing... it's a very fine line where when the big performers play well like Casemiro, Rashford, Bruno, Licha, they can drag some of our other players up, but when they aren't at the races, the last people you want to be relying on is the likes of Dalot, Fred, even Shaw is in danger of putting himself in this category and DDG needs to go as well.

"No way, Dalot has had plenty of good games. Sept - November 2022 Dalot was one of our best performers consistently opening up our right side and overlapping.

"A large chunk of their fans make that hard though; the victim mentality and idea that refs are always 100% against them and for us gets tiresome. Even when you show facts that fergie time isn’t actually real, or talk about calls in their favor like the dives that help them keep the invincible going. They act like saints but forget Vieira was as big a dick as they say keane was",Manchester United,Yes,jayk8bn,t1_jayixv0
"Don’t know why you’re getting downvoted. We’d all love United to win it but, given the choice of the other 2, arsenal are surely the lesser of two evils…

I’d rather put the effort into avoiding reading comments from arsenal fans that I’ve never met on R/Soccer (apparently they’re annoying?) than have to endure the unavoidable historical fact that City equal our record. 
The fact that people are being downvoted and called “plastic” for not wanting city to win the league is laughable",Manchester United,Yes,jayqrgp,t1_jayixv0

Third option is us but we’re not winning it realistically,Manchester United,Yes,jayvc8n,t1_jayv8qw
"There was pure hatred between United and Arsenal, just as u/ErikElevenHag alludes to. From Fabregas throwing a pizza at Fergie, to Keown celebrating RVNs penalty miss right in front of his face, Arsenal players trying to break Ronaldos legs to slow him down, Arsenal players doing the same to Nani for his seal dribble, the pre-game animosity between Keane and Vieira...I could go on for days. Its way more than a sporting rivalry.",Manchester United,Yes,jazmrbk,t1_jayx9b7

They just happen to be rivals based on something other than a rivalry due to competition...

Are we Spurs rival? If not, why?",Manchester United,Yes,jayxgl6,t1_jayuyah
Janujaz was so poorly used by Moyes and LVG. He dint even have the proper physique to compete in the PL and yet was used every single game. Technically he was really good but I never got that aura that he would consistently perform. He just wasn't ready.,Manchester United,Yes,jazwwv9,t1_jazvg70

"Not OP but I cannot. I am too important at this time. 

I took an equivilent to this day off for sick a previous time and I had a call at 1 that was VERY apologetic and asking if I could possibly log on, offered me 3 extra holiday days.

"I believe Rooney was a bit of an exception. 

Rooney, unlike most generational talents, sacrificed a lot for the team. He played second fiddle to first Van Nistelrooy, then Ronaldo and then Van Persie, only got 3 seasons as the out and out striker of the team, which was his best position. He would run back, defend deep, press, shunted through the wings just to accommodate someone else.

The second problem was himself. Man did not care for his body. I'm talking about binge drinking and lack of proper diet and recovery. I genuinely believe if Rooney had taken good care of himself he could've easily played till 35 in his favored central striker position here (maybe not first choice).",Manchester United,Yes,jazsln7,t1_jazkc13
"Like Pedri. He is world class, but he plays every single game for Barca, and already got a hamstring injury at such a young age. I pray for him that Barca finds a competent back up or otherwise that's another generational talent just gone because of injury",Manchester United,Yes,jazno64,t1_jazkc13
"It’s difficult to say cause most of the players that played today had good games but that doesn’t mean we have a good squad. Weghorst, McTominay not good enough, Martial never fit and he would start this game, Fred reverted to form. We need competition for places and options off the bench",Manchester United,Yes,jb1io4y,t1_jb1hz9e
Where does this spot come from though?,Manchester United,Yes,jazrcog,t1_jazak0l
That has changed in the last couple of years.   You don't get CL for finishing outside the top4 unless you are the team that won the CL or EL.,Manchester United,Yes,jazeoli,t1_jazae30
Agreed. What was really frustrating is many of the goals came down to individual defense mistakes. The fourth goal was a bit unlucky but everything went out the window after that and team came apart at the seams,Manchester United,Yes,jb1jb52,t1_jb1icgz
"Weghorst isn't good enough to play for us. De Gea has saved our asses so many times yes but he has also been a part of so many spankings. Just 3 alone this season off the top of my head (Brentford, City and Liverpool). Why can't we upgrade our keeper position instead of renewing a clearly declining De Gea ?",Manchester United,Yes,jb3xl14,t1_jb2hiy4
He's nowhere good enough to be a number ten. Why would we sign him as a striker when he's scored 1 goal in 14 games and doesn't ever look like scoring? Not to mention he's 2 in 20 at Burnley. He quite clearly can't handle the league,Manchester United,Yes,jb23lnw,t1_jb22x5k
"Funny cause this seems like what my mum

"De Gea is an overrated goalkeeper as well but he's been in goal for years without us regularly getting trounced. Bruno quite clearly lacks tactical discipline. It's been obvious for years. His lack of discipline combined with his petulant, childish antics when things aren't going going his way create the perfect storm for teams to blitz through us

"Let me first clarify that I'm not from Qatar nor do I support the things they do.

But the entire argument in English media against Qatari and other oil states ownership is based on morality. What they're trying to say is if barely 80 years later, you can suddenly hold the moral high ground. Germany, in contrast, at least acknowledge that what happened was not acceptable and don't try to moral police everyone. And then there's the UK lecturing everyone while having skeletons in their closet.",Manchester United,Yes,jb00lkg,t1_jazys6g

"Yeah, the whole ‘Rashford is the best player in the world’ stuff going around was just an example of how giddy the feeling had got around here. We still have the 3rd best squad in the league and got a long way to go to get to City’s level.",Manchester United,Yes,jb1kyul,t1_jb1jrxu
"The thing is they can demand whatever the fuck they want but the other clubs know that Chelsea can't afford to keep so many players in their squad especially when they need to buy new ones in the summer ,If the buying clubs are smart they would just keep pushing them closer to deadline day and Chelsea would be forced to sell a lot of players at low fee,At the moment they have 33 players",Manchester United,Yes,jaztqqp,t1_jaztg3x

As I understand, charges have been dropped due to lack of legal evidence, so Greenwood surely needs to continue to deny any wrongdoing? 

Wouldn’t a public apology, for example, be effectively an admission of guilt? (He can’t apologise for abusing his girlfriend whilst simultaneously claim that he’s innocent of abusing his girlfriend). 

I can’t see him risking the re-possibility of punishment, especially with a baby now in the picture. 


I think the likelihood is that Greenwood/ his lawyers will be sticking to a story which will “clear up” the events, attempting to prove that he is innocent. 

Seems like there are 2 options:

1) The club conclude that they don’t believe him and/ or he is not worth the risk. He therefore never plays for the club again.

2) The club do believe him and/ or want to give him another chance, in which case he will forever be presented as innocent, however rival fans and a significant amount of United fans will continue to think otherwise.

Personally, I was still very uncomfortable with him playing, but at least there was a genuine argument given he denied the evidence.

With Greenwood, there is clear audio of him raping his partner with accompanying photographic evidence. It’s just more obvious, damning and less refutable than Ronaldos.

If Greenwood wants to play again, he should have to explain why the audio wasn’t him raping her. Good luck with that.",Manchester United,Yes,javjn85,t1_javazdy

"TBH No, and that’s the hill i’m prepared to die on, MGs case is no different than CR7 and Partey. The idea that you have to “see/hear the evidence” to really believe their guilt is ludicrous and furthers the believe that most of the people “cancelling” MG are following the general consensus to avoid criticism (similar to how many in the US denounced the idea of voting for Trump, & then he became President - yes we know “Electoral College” but that didn’t stop 60m+ ppl from voting for him). 

Working in the corporate world, has shown me that MG will likely play for us again and the PR spin is about to put us all in a tizzy (think along the lines of role play, it was fake blood for a halloween costume, he was playfighting with her, etc) and she may come out with a performance worthy of an Oscar (it’s been a nightmare people trying to destroy our family, an “innocent” black man wrongly accused, my pregnancy, etc). 

While I’d be fine if he didn’t play for us again, if I watched Giggs & Ronaldo, knowing what scum they were and celebrating United winning, i can’t lie here on Reddit and say him coming back will make me turn my back on the club.",Manchester United,Yes,javne6t,t1_javazdy
For me it's how the club handled it. The whole team cancelled him on social media and United was quick to distance themselves from him.

Dalot varane martinez shaw (vvd isn’t quite as finished as people say, I think he’d be a good rotation option. Also dalot is my preferred rb)

Casemiro eriksen bruno (although personally I think a Thiago at his best would be amazing for us)

salah nunez rashford",Manchester United,Yes,jav5tv9,t1_jav4k3f
[deleted],Manchester United,Yes,jav4sf5,t1_jav4k3f
"A striker. We can manage without FDJ with Eriksen, Fred, and  maybe Sabitzer.",Manchester United,Yes,jauor6w,t1_jaunyhq
No way he joins after our captain thundercunted the ball into his chest,Manchester United,Yes,jauz0tj,t1_jaunyhq
"Crazy how we have so many legitimate options for this.

Rashy - academy lad with great head on his shoulders. Massive influence on and off the pitch

Case - resume speaks for itself

Licha - TH's lieutenant over 2 clubs now

DDG - tenure at the club, CS leader

Outside shout

Luke Shaw - clearly has a top mentality coming back from his break, and mourinhos dog house (switched to CB flawlessly)

My pick is Rashy",Manchester United,Yes,jaw89da,t1_javulj5
I think De Gea is the obvious choice. Longest tenured player and extremely well respected within the dressing room,Manchester United,Yes,jawwbgl,t1_javulj5
Rashy,Manchester United,Yes,javvjl4,t1_javulj5
De Gea or Shaw,Manchester United,Yes,jawbnud,t1_javulj5
"He can't earn a chance after what he did. Certainly not in the better leagues, anyway. Sell him to Turkey or wherever else doesn't care about what he's done and donate the profits to a domestic abuse charity. As someone who has escaped from an abusive relationship myself, that would make me love this club even more. On the contrary, seeing him in our shirt again would make me reconsider.",Manchester United,Yes,javfn6t,t1_javcl3g
"We didn't play any better when he didn't play.
Last season we won none of the games when he didn't start.",Manchester United,Yes,javyvb6,t1_javnm84
"Dunno how you're getting downvoted here. Ronaldo did not link up with any players, or press, or offer much of anything at all at the 9 but demanded that he plays. 

Ten Hag had the luxury of him destroying the team last season and his poor form to make the big call. We would have been so much better without him.",Manchester United,Yes,javvi1z,t1_javnm84
"No chance, our team was horrible and Ronald bailed us out in many instances. I know the end was sour but things before it were a success.",Manchester United,Yes,javo3de,t1_javnm84
So you mean the one who scored 24 goals in a season was the reason why Ole and Ralf dint get their tactics right?,Manchester United,Yes,javonvp,t1_javnm84
"He wasn't helping the team but it's utterly stupid to pin our bad season on him. Even the opening game in which we beat Leeds there was something off about the team. Players like Rashford, Shaw and Maguire were shit from day 1 and would've remained being shit regardless of Ronaldo. I'm glad he's gone this season but last season would've gone worse without him.",Manchester United,Yes,javxdwo,t1_javnm84
"If player X is on 200k a week, and has 2 years left on his contract, he's not going to accept a 4-year 100k a week.",Manchester United,Yes,jave5mx,t1_javd7fl
"It influences the player's willingness to move. The stupidly high wages and long contracts that Woodward used to give our squad players meant that no club that would buy them was going to maintain that high salary. So it became much more attractive for guys like Brandon Williams (£65k/week) or Bailly (£80k) to stay and sit on the bench. From the opposite side, most other clubs are less likely to buy these guys because those salaries would be at the limit of what they could afford and would ruin their wage structure, creating dissatisfaction among teammates who would be earning significantly less than e.g. Bailly.",Manchester United,Yes,javenji,t1_javd7fl
offer 250k to rashford see if he will stay out of loyalty since we already back him so much.,Manchester United,Yes,javedlf,t1_javd7fl
"I don't find ETH's conferences entertaining in the humorous way. LvG and Mourinho were good for that. ETH just speaks straight facts. Never complains, always drops some wisdom, and I love how he constantly reinforces the need to stay focused on the next game only.",Manchester United,Yes,jauvo0n,t1_jaurz4i
Nah Jose is more entertaining,Manchester United,Yes,jauufpb,t1_jaurz4i
I'm at the part where I only find wacky pressers to be entertaining. ETH is too professional to be entertaining lol,Manchester United,Yes,jauzyi1,t1_jaurz4i
ETH has maybe the most no-nonsense press conferences ever,Manchester United,Yes,jav19v2,t1_jaurz4i
"Everyone is going to say no, but Michael Owen winning the prem with us was one of the funniest things in football",Manchester United,Yes,javft3w,t1_javeojr
"If not good enough for liverpool, then not good enough for us",Manchester United,Yes,javf362,t1_javeojr
no thanks,Manchester United,Yes,javf4qz,t1_javeojr
"Is he really “lethal as hell”?

He has 59 goals in 128 career Serie A appearances and 18 goals in 42 games since joining Juve (who are actually in great form now having won 12 and drew one of their last 15 Serie A games)

Mitrovic was also keeping him out of the Serbia side in the World Cup, and then there were the rumours of affairs with teammates wife (Rajkovic)",Manchester United,Yes,jaus4fd,t1_jaur1ht
reus. now that is a name I have not heard for a long time.,Manchester United,Yes,javd4hh,t1_javcy05
"I really don't think so. He's nearly 34, frequently injured and we have lots of depth at attacking mid and on the wings already. Would be a bad move imo",Manchester United,Yes,javdwh0,t1_javcy05
"
>I was wondering where would he fit in our lineup.

Treatment table probably

Missed 107 days through injury this season already, that's why he's out of contract.",Manchester United,Yes,javfvy9,t1_javcy05
Very good player who'd play a game then disappear to the treatment table for the next 10. Not worth it even on a free & reasonable wages.,Manchester United,Yes,javmv6l,t1_javcy05
"He will be expensive, not consistent and not a priority. De Gea, who is popular with the players, is doing well and will probably be rewarded with a new 2-3 year contract, albeit with lesser wage (£250k/week) i think. In case he doesn’t accept, there’s still Dean. All i am saying is we need to break the bank for a world-class striker. If there’s more budget, then we can experiment.",Manchester United,Yes,jaul3mp,t1_jaug2be
And let's ask Bale to come out of retirement while we're at it.,Manchester United,Yes,jauuxep,t1_jaus3s9
Do you watch the games or just the highlights?,Manchester United,Yes,javm37d,t1_javjism
"Agree to an extent. However, you could also argue that without his work rate and hunger we would be worst without him than with him.",Manchester United,Yes,javk7mn,t1_javjism
"DCL is forever injured, don't need a worse Martial",Manchester United,Yes,javspii,t1_javlsvh
Our physios don't need the extra work.,Manchester United,Yes,javmhgp,t1_javlsvh
That would be horrible and I doubt a club that has never been relegated would be putting relegation release clauses in their contracts,Manchester United,Yes,javn2lq,t1_javlsvh
Rather get Onana,Manchester United,Yes,javqwpb,t1_javlsvh
dude... https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2023/01/30/chelsea-takeover-donation-ukraine-war-victims-still-needs-eu/,Manchester United,Yes,jau7bvj,t1_jau4z9y
"> Chelsea's spending makes sense to me 

they are spending so much becos they can do it with the ffp loophole which uefa will limit to max 5 year amortization from now on. they spend 600m spread over 7 years is 85m amortization. they sold 60m worth of fringe players this season. so they actually spend 25m this season. and given that they are one of the best in selling players, and now with a bloated squad, it won't be a problem for them to sell 60m every season.",Manchester United,Yes,jaugghx,t1_jau4z9y
Spoken like free thinker. It sounds plausible to me. I like a well thought conspiracy!,Manchester United,Yes,jau7hbz,t1_jau4z9y
The only forwards we should be looking at are pure strikers imo,Manchester United,Yes,jawvj0e,t1_jaw46jt
Amads gonna get an extension surely,Manchester United,Yes,javaftm,t1_javadyp
sunderland fans love him right now.,Manchester United,Yes,javfcs0,t1_javadyp
Pellistri still isn’t playing much so imagine he’ll be loaned out/sold. Amad would then be given the opportunity. Just my thoughts though.,Manchester United,Yes,javkba4,t1_javadyp
if amad has a season in the prem that will do him great,Manchester United,Yes,javdjqm,t1_javadyp
I suppose he'll be evaluated in pre-season & then a decision will be made.,Manchester United,Yes,javn5pa,t1_javadyp
Hope he gets 1 more season at a prem club hopefully a club like Southampton if they don’t get relegated,Manchester United,Yes,javdwd6,t1_javadyp
"State ownership. I don’t want to be owned by any state at all as you get intrinsically linked to the actions of that state - in this case, questions of homophobia, democracy, etc will come up.

Plus whenever City, PSG and soon to be Newcastle win, within minutes the questions turn to blood money and oil. There’s effectively an asterisk next to every win. I’d rather not have that.

This club is big enough and rich enough to fund itself. We don’t need a sugar daddy oil state to win.",Manchester United,Yes,javihpr,t1_javgg87
Because Qatar kills people because they are gay,Manchester United,Yes,javh183,t1_javgg87
They can’t replace TAA for sure,Manchester United,Yes,jauplva,t1_jaul85i

"Chelsea have renewed their interest in RB Leipzig defender Josko Gvardiol, 21, with Manchester City and Tottenham also keen on the Croatia international who has a £97m release clause in his contract that comes into effect from 2024. (Times - subscription required)",Manchester United,Yes,jauw5of,t1_jautl48
He has massive shouts outs for Sergio ramos. No wonder he pairs perfectly with Varane!,Manchester United,Yes,javfane,t1_jav2ffk
Schezwan or Normal?,Manchester United,Yes,jauli1a,t1_jau4h3m
"he just signed a long term contract till 2027 w an option to extend a year  
he will be soooooooooooooooo expensive",Manchester United,Yes,jau8t6n,t1_jau75ta
only or with one of the others?,Manchester United,Yes,jau8lql,t1_jau75ta
"But right now considering how well we are doing and how we are clearly lacking that one striker to complete the puzzle, Kane would also be excited at the opportunity. He could have a crack at Shearers record, while winning trophies at the same time. 

And he only has a year left in his contract. I'm buzzing at the idea of having him lead the attack",Manchester United,Yes,jawdj9l,t1_jaw4892
Problem with that is he wants to compete for trophies,Manchester United,Yes,jaw7jlb,t1_jaw4892
I'm not too sure of that tbh. Ik there was some interest in an extension but Kane isn't delusional. Spurs are in no position to win anything,Manchester United,Yes,jaww33z,t1_jaw4892
"I feel a midfield of Case - FDJ - Bruno would work a charm.

FDJ gives us a Case Replacement as well as someone who can play alongside Case as well!",Manchester United,Yes,javgfzi,t1_javex4e
Thank fuck it's a bank holiday,Manchester United,Yes,jauk763,t1_jaug0c4
"It's been sort of proven that a 50-50 call in our favour is many times as controversial as a blatently wrong call in anyone else's favour. Proof: the bruno goal was talked about wall-to-wall for 5 days. No other decision ever gets that treatment. Not one. I can understand one day as it was an interesting call.and definitely strange, beyond that, no.

Then the media publish well-timed articles like this and it gets in ref's heads.

Oh and a large portion of footballing media former players seemingly played for Liverpool. No such thing as coincidence.",Manchester United,Yes,javtf7l,t1_javr6pj
Sir you missed out pastor Fred,Manchester United,Yes,jauykuj,t1_jauwsvx
"Maybe I should've worded it better but what I was trying to say is that I saw a lot of comments from black people being angry at Rashford for dating a white woman. That's what I don't understand as a black man myself, we should be proud of seeing black men/women succeed no matter what.",Manchester United,Yes,javnd33,t1_javm44p
"for all the people that downvoted this, i suppose that the BLM ""protest"" kneel has solved world racism? comical.",Manchester United,Yes,jawbibf,t1_javm44p

Tuanzebe got injured for a year and casually pocketed mbappe in his first game back. Nothing's set in stone ofcourse.,Manchester United,Yes,jav3pqz,t1_jaux52w
“don’t want my love for the club tarnished” you realise we were playing ronaldo right?,Manchester United,Yes,jau7ouv,t1_jau5c76
"So you accept he raped someone but that’s ok he can still play? After all why would he need to apologise if he didn’t do it. I very much doubt that would be the opinion if he was a sub-par player. And what’s the point of a morality clause if he walks for this one - one rape is fine, but two is too much?

And the comparisons to others are disingenuous. I can’t think of another Utd player with such clear evidence - an audio recording - of him raping someone (or another crime equally severe).

No. The club needs to draw a line and just get rid. Or else we’ll have constant rape chants at the game and protests from within and without the club.",Manchester United,Yes,jaulc97,t1_jau80os
Awesome thanks. Will take train a say earlier from London then,Manchester United,Yes,jawwok3,t1_jawvau6

I feel8 points lead with one game more is enough of a cusion over Newcastle.,Manchester United,Yes,javagqx,t1_java70x
"Iirc, Ronaldo one was settled, he paid off the victim. Isn't that worse than the case being dropped?
In the Partey situation, does it really matter where it happened? I'm more concerned about the moral situation not the legal one.",Manchester United,Yes,javc14m,t1_javbhni
Is it the case that you don't believe those other two other incidents but believe this one because you saw and heard the evidence?,Manchester United,Yes,javbmto,t1_javbczm
"I'm asking about the public, I'm asking what you think. Does it make a difference to you?",Manchester United,Yes,javbr3z,t1_javbhkw

"I saw the Aston Villa game in full, saw the Hat trick. I remember getting pissed off at the Nani red card vs Madrid, so I caught those games as well. I remember watching SAF's speech to the Stretford End at the end as well. But yeah, I've heard from friends that I missed a good season",Manchester United,Yes,jav88n2,t1_jav7pm9
"You'd take Trent over Dalot?

Allison over David I see, but not the right back.",Manchester United,Yes,javanbm,t1_jav6dv8
Thiago is bad this season. Loses possession often when pressed and doesn't win second balls or duels. Rest I agree.,Manchester United,Yes,javd7wa,t1_jav62g2
"this is true, and downvotes don't change that",Manchester United,Yes,jav7h9n,t1_jav62g2
"Think OP meant a combined 11 with Liverpool and *Manchester* United, not Newcastle /s",Manchester United,Yes,jav5hq7,t1_jav4sf5
Trent really?? Alisson is definitely a much better keeper than de gea though.,Manchester United,Yes,jav5xkk,t1_jav4sf5
I tend to agree. But bloody hell de Jong is a bentley of a player.,Manchester United,Yes,jauoxhl,t1_jauor6w
Look at Ramos going to PSG with Messi that was more of a feud than Bruno kicking the ball at FDJ.,Manchester United,Yes,jav6h4b,t1_jauz0tj
"Yeah Rashford is our star player, a great influence on and off the pitch, he he deserves it big time",Manchester United,Yes,jaw4ry3,t1_javvjl4
"He most definitely does not and should not have a career at United. He threw that away a long time ago.


He can try and earn another shot at having a football career but he most definitely does not deserve another chance at United.",Manchester United,Yes,javg2n6,t1_javfn6t
we were winning against chelsea and everton until he came on like dont even go there,Manchester United,Yes,jaw0hft,t1_javyvb6

"“Back him so much”. You act like they have done him a favour. He had a bad season driven by injury and enormous upheaval at the club. Go look at the other seasons. He played through injury ffs and to a high standard factoring in his age.

If I was him and offered £250k when the top earners at the club are on £350k, I know what I’d say. You just want to take advantage of him because he’s an academy player.",Manchester United,Yes,javiu3y,t1_javedlf

"There isn’t still Dean, he’s found his level at Forest and also blatantly violates the “no dickheads” policy",Manchester United,Yes,jausjoi,t1_jaul3mp
"He is a young keeper and he is very consistent for Porto. His world cup was poor, but aside from that he is really good.

World class striker is a bigger priority, but we still need a modern keeper. De Gea has improved, but he still makes it too easy for our opponents to win the ball and we often overcomplicate our build-up in effort not to pass to him. We saw that against Barcelona, especially in the first tie.

I don't mind keeping him around, but we really should be thinking about a replacement for him. If we stick with him for 2-3 seasons as a starter then we'll just be bottlenecking ourselves unless he becomes really good at passing (which won't happen). I'd preferably get his replacement as soon as possible. We can then give him cup matches.

As for Deano, he doesn't have what it takes unfortunately. He had potential for it, but he also isn't the answer.",Manchester United,Yes,jaumzt9,t1_jaul3mp
"Lmao 250k/w what? For a low to mid tier keeper?

Let's be honest, if he wasn't already our player we wouldn't have gone for him. And if we did go for him, I highly doubt we will pay anything more than 125k/w and even then it still feels excessive for someone of his skills.

Wanting to keep him just because he's been here for 10 years is basically sunk cost fallacy.",Manchester United,Yes,jauzvcb,t1_jaul3mp

"Unlike Martial though (whose knees and hip are completely shot), DCL doesn't have any recurring injuries, he's usually out with something new every time. He missed half of last season with a broken toe, that's just bad luck.

Liverpool are starting a rebuild now. Milan are cooking nicely

In comparison :
Garnacho/Rashford ST Sancho (maybe Amad, don't think pellistri will make it here)
We have Bruno (good for maybe 3-5 more years ?) And no one else long term midfield (maybe Mainoo or Iqbal or Savage)

Malacia, Martinez, RCB, Dalot ( unless he leaves, Laird and AWB look unlikely for long term)

Yeah I didn’t enjoy that much either.,Manchester United,Yes,javpwd3,t1_jau7ouv
This,Manchester United,Yes,jaubtuh,t1_jau7ouv
I dont even understand how people can compare Ronaldo to Greenwood's situation. There is clear audio evidence in this. Ronaldo as much as people want to drag him to whitewash Greenwood was cleared of the charges by the police. Greenwood was not. It is clear police have their hands tied due to the girl being pregnant which makes it even worst because it shows how bizarre this situation is.,Manchester United,Yes,jau9wvm,t1_jau7ouv
I mean there is still pretty clear cut evidences pointing towards them. What you're implying is basically their crimes matter less because victims opted to go to judiciary instead of just posting it online. Court of public opinion is NOT greater than the actual legal system,Manchester United,Yes,jaune0q,t1_jaulc97
"First, I think rapists should be punished appropriately, and I acknowledge that the reporting rate, prosecution rate, and successful prosecution rate of rape charges likely underrepresent the occurrence of rape.

Having said that, if the man is engaged/married to the woman in question, and she is expecting his child... This is a complex situation and absolutism has no role here. I really don't give a fuck about what the public thinks about greenwood. what does his victim/fiance/wife/mother of his child think? I would be very slow to ignore her opinion or belittle it. Don't take away her agency. She is planning on living with this man for the rest of her life as things stand.

Granted there may be an element of folie au deux here, but no one can legislate for that.

Talk of contracts and his value as a player is tone-deaf.",Manchester United,Yes,jawfuct,t1_jaulc97

"You or I wouldn't settle, we wouldn't have the means.

Assumption then is why would someone settle for such large amounts of money if they are not guilty therefore settlement is admission of guilt.

However celebrities are very nearly always told to settle out of court. It means they can often get back to what they do to earn money, without an elongated court case and without anything case or not case related coming our and tarring the celebrity.

None of us KNOW that Ronaldo is guilty, sure you can point to the ""evidence"" in Der Spiegel, a publication that has been in trouble for faking stories in the past, and I would say that yes IF it comes from Ronaldo and is genuine, then it's pretty damning in itself, but there is no proof of it being the case.

"> Iirc, Ronaldo one was settled, he paid off the victim. Isn't that worse than the case being dropped?

No. Settling isn't an indication of guilt. Due to the high profile nature of celebrities and how just a mere accusation of something bad can be damaging to their career, they'll just settle things and pay money to try and avoid it hitting the media, regardless of if it's true or not because a lot of people will just hear the accusaiton, think they're guilty and then not pay any attention to how the case goes, and sometimes it'll come out they were innocent and did nothing wrong but the public doesn't notice and their career is still badly affected.

"It wasn't taken off her word you numpty

From documents that the Football Leaks whistleblowing platform has passed on to Der Spiegel, it appears that Mayorga's then lawyer contacted a Ronaldo lawyer in July 2009. In the months that followed, a whole team of lawyers dealt with the accusations. They raise a hundred questions for Ronaldo, his brother-in-law and his nephew.

In that document Ronaldo receives the alias' X. 'Kathryn Mayorga is' Ms. C '.

There are multiple versions of the questionnaire. The questions remain similar, but the answers are not. In a December 2009 version, Ronaldo talks about sex with mutual consent. He also says that he did not receive any signals that she did not agree with sex, or that she felt bad afterwards.

But there is another, older version of the questionnaire. De Standaard has also been able to view that document. That questionnaire was sent by mail in September 2009. The sender is a lawyer from the office of Carlos Osório de Castro, a confidant of Ronaldo. The recipients of the e-mail were Osório de Castro and another colleague.

'No, no, no'

On the question if Ms. C (Mayorga, ed.) Would have raised, shouted or called her voice, replied X (Ronaldo, ed.):

""She said no and stop several times."" She would have been lying on her side. ""I pushed her past behind. It was brutal. We have not changed the position. 5/7 minutes. She said she did not want it, but she kept herself available. ""And further:"" She has always said no. ""Do not do it. I'm not like the others. ""In retrospect, I apologized."" But she would not have shouted or called.

Question: Does Ms. C said something about it that the sex would have been too brutal for her? X: 'She did not complain about it being too brutal. She complained that I forced her. She did not say she would go to the police. ""

Ronaldo confirms in that version of the questionnaire that Mayorga has said no more than once. And he apologized to her afterwards. There are contradictions about whether Kathryn Mayorga would have satisfied him by hand. He says yes. She says not.

He also describes a foreplay in the bathroom. He also describes the previous acquaintance in the nightclub differently than she does: the women would have asked to be in the VIP section and have drunk a lot. Phone numbers would not have been exchanged. Ronaldo would have invited the women in the club to his hotel.

“What happened is when that [arrest warrant] was submitted to the district attorney’s office, Mr. Wolfson declined to prosecute,” said Mayorga’s attorney, Leslie Mark Stovall, according to the transcript. “He doesn’t say why he decided to decline and anything – any argument is just speculation.

"Most players over 100m aren't really worth it

Enzo for 108?
Lukaka for 100?
Felix for 120 like 5 years ago...",Manchester United,Yes,jaqbmmf,t1_jaqa9eu
"Bellingham is incredible I don't understand how people don't rate him. He's technically excellent, solid defensively, plays with a lot of hunger, reads the game well and is only 19. Signing a player like him nails on a starting midfielder for a decade.

De Jong currently is definitely the better fit but Bellingham is 6 years younger than him. Who's to say he can't be developed to be more positionally disciplined by EtH?",Manchester United,Yes,jat5pwt,t1_jaqa9eu
Most of the games he looks bad is when he plays with maguire. Both of them are solid when they are paired with varane/Lisandro. But I rate Lindelöf much higher than maguire. So hopefully he stays and we only have to replace maguire. Other than that our defensive depth is awesome.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqrnwc,t1_jaqhd82
"Ideally he stay, but won't blame him for leaving for game time.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqkwyu,t1_jaqhd82
I hope he does. Always liked him but I do think he’s too good to be a back up all the time. If he moved to Italy or Germany he’d start every game.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqjl6p,t1_jaqhd82
"Is it a tourist thing? Make it look like you had ""a proper English matchday"" on the lash, eating pies from a van and going home with you're programme. You can make it look like you were there at OT on insta!",Manchester United,Yes,jaqslvg,t1_jaqr8uq
Payback wages.,Manchester United,Yes,jaql9jb,t1_jaqkz5b
Whats it without the backpay though,Manchester United,Yes,jaqmsmh,t1_jaqkz5b
Surely we encounter the same issue this summer (if we pursue) that FDJ will still want Barca to cover his entitlement to deferred wages (less the balance he's got this year) and we will only want to pay him a fair wage (lets say 300k).,Manchester United,Yes,jaqsiu0,t1_jaqkz5b
Barca really fucked themselves,Manchester United,Yes,jat5gtw,t1_jaqkz5b
Indeed sad news for us when our best striker is out.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqrqr9,t1_jaqqz69
At least diaz isnt back yet though,Manchester United,Yes,jaqrowo,t1_jaqqz69
"\>Bruno not rested

&#x200B;

Andy Carroll will remain in the championship for what he did to Eriksen",Manchester United,Yes,jarlwv7,t1_jar3i42
Nobody talks about this. I wonder how much he might’ve stagnated when the goalkeeper coaches kept changing. Especially after the former coach left in bad terms.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqxjcq,t1_jaq7fnv
"Went to a few matches with mates when he played in the championship for Huddersfield, looked a class above them. Composed on the ball, physical and not lacking in pace",Manchester United,Yes,jaqfze6,t1_jaqegrt
We would be very dumb not to if the price is half way reasonable. He’s solid af. I really like his game. Good addition for January window. Wout too for that matter.,Manchester United,Yes,jatpshr,t1_jas3hqc
"It’s certainly possible that we might try for Vlahovic given Juve’s financial situation. He seems more like a Chelsea type of striker though. Plus Italian league strikers almost never do well in the premier league. Vlahovic has shown nothing so far (including international tournaments) to suggest he’d light it up in this league. Just see what Scamacca has done at West Ham. 

We need a world class CF to compete against Man City and Haaland. After RVP left we’ve literally been making do with injured or old “past their best” strikers like Falcao, Zlatan, Cavani and Ronaldo. The two best options by far would be Osimhen and Kane. I’d put Vlahovic a distant third best option.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqe6lg,t1_jaqdoxg
Romeo Lavia from Southampton too.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqjwg7,t1_jaqdoxg
Kim isn't going to move to be a 3rd choice,Manchester United,Yes,jaqmxr8,t1_jaqdoxg
Cavani,Manchester United,Yes,jaqk1aj,t1_jaqjfhn
"Do you mean first signature celebration in our squad’s history or just the current squad? If it’s the former, all of Rooney, Nani, Lingard, Pogba and co had a couple, albeit they cycled through them quite often.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqjli4,t1_jaqjfhn
Loads of players do it though don’t they?,Manchester United,Yes,jaqjyw4,t1_jaqjfhn
"I think you can definitely count Ronaldo because he created a new celebration, the one where he is pretending to sleep after he slept in the bus or something. He didn't score many goals this season so we didn't see it much, but he was definitely trying to make it a thing.",Manchester United,Yes,jar95oo,t1_jaqjfhn
Lee Sharpe.,Manchester United,Yes,jarbv0w,t1_jaqjfhn
"The good news is this is for 5 games so it’s likely you’ll get at least one of them. Also the Fulham game is on ballot so the queue doesn’t matter. This is nothing like being behind 70,000 people for that Barcelona game",Manchester United,Yes,jaqk3g3,t1_jaqjms9
"Yep, I feel you. No idea if there’ll be any seats left over by the time we get in.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqjtl8,t1_jaqjms9
The other one is as well. Steve Round was Moyes' assistant,Manchester United,Yes,jar2pr7,t1_jaqxsi0
I didn't realize pelligrini is the manager of Betis. Will be weird to see him again,Manchester United,Yes,jarwh5o,t1_jaqxsi0
his peak squad won 1 covid premier league title and was hyped as best squad of all time lmao,Manchester United,Yes,jaru6xq,t1_jarliet
Seems a bit of a weird claim. I think this team has a good mix of youth and experience especially if we focus on some younger midfielders.,Manchester United,Yes,jarv4bh,t1_jarliet
The 20 years was just a bit of hyperbole but his point was a stupid one anyway.,Manchester United,Yes,jasa5gp,t1_jarliet
Not built for twenty ? Watch Casemiro stay World Class into his early 50s.,Manchester United,Yes,jatrqso,t1_jarliet
Every PL club would have the same idea. Fees will be anything but modest,Manchester United,Yes,jaqvh2d,t1_jaqr2ip
Why you think we can get a hot prospect midfielder in EPL with a modest fee?,Manchester United,Yes,jaqw921,t1_jaqr2ip
"Stop paying off refs. 
Start pulling levers. 
This is the way.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqmt98,t1_jaqevpa
What news?,Manchester United,Yes,jaqg00s,t1_jaqevpa
Because they need the money?,Manchester United,Yes,jaqf8ds,t1_jaqevpa
Pay no mind as long as we win the 3 points in the end.,Manchester United,Yes,jaq15py,t1_japv1o0
Feeling good now. Probably will be hungover come Sunday because I have no self control.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqbqse,t1_jaqa8iq
I'd say a narrow win. Possibly 2-1 but that's to keep the nerves calmed. Considering how they are playing and how we are i hope a demolition.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqf7jj,t1_jaqa8iq
I wonder if stretford end will cheer or remain silent if he scores,Manchester United,Yes,jarlrup,t1_jar4ym1
"We struggled there in our best of years.

Anfield is a fortress. If not for Real Madrid, it is for us.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqcxty,t1_jaqbs61
"I was a lot more confident a couple of weeks ago. Since then, the Scousers have improved enough to see a win over United kick-starting their charge into the top four.

On the other hand, beating them will hurt them even more.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqk5ng,t1_jaqbs61
"A bit yeah. I just hope even if we lose, it's gonna be close game like Arsenal away, but just don't let me see Nunez score a late winner, my heart can't take it",Manchester United,Yes,jaql7fh,t1_jaqbs61
"Maybe Scott.

Don't think Fred will leave.

Relatively low wages and we won't get much if we sold him anyway.",Manchester United,Yes,jas3o5o,t1_jas0hg7
McTominay is a must sell imo. Fred should stay. Hopefully we sign a top centre mid then Fred can exclusively be used as a second half sub which is when he's at his best,Manchester United,Yes,jat1yf2,t1_jas0hg7
I highly doubt we were looking within England for depth. It'll probably be someone from the Netherlands,Manchester United,Yes,jaszk9b,t1_jaskbcb
"The extension is just to make sure that if he does go, it's for silly money. Wouldn't be surprised if there were release clauses included.",Manchester United,Yes,jatrac5,t1_jaskbcb
"Absolutely blows my mind that not only were the Glazers able to buy United by putting the debt on us, but then they don't even have to pay the debt off. Just looks like one massive scam. 

They truly are parasites. They've done nothing but drained it and allowed it to decay.",Manchester United,Yes,jarbace,t1_jaqm0iw
"The number one priority for any new owner should be clearing the debt so the club can be self sufficient. If Ratcliffe won't do that, what's the point of him even getting involved?",Manchester United,Yes,jaqp4i6,t1_jaqm0iw
Youve totally missed the point of why people don’t want the Qatari’s.,Manchester United,Yes,jarbneo,t1_jaqm0iw
"Not sure why anyone takes any of this as gospel, we've seen media get it wrong or misrepresent stuff and owners lie plenty of times. We're in the middle of negotiations, we've already seen the Glazers take sudden interest in staying when the bids were a bit lower than they wanted. Not saying it's not true but this is that weird middle space where we know some names, we know the intention, but really, we know fuck all else. Which i accept is a frustrating spot to be in.",Manchester United,Yes,jar0jy1,t1_jaqm0iw
I would keep the debt if clearing it comes at the cost of selling the club to the Qatari bigots,Manchester United,Yes,jaqs9f9,t1_jaqm0iw
Supporting Qatar takeover =/= supporting Greenwood. Ffs some people just have cabbage for brains,Manchester United,Yes,jaqo5ow,t1_jaqkkpm
"I think that’s harsh. Most people expected Greenwood to be prosecuted at the very least, the charges being dropped and the victim still being with him and soon having his kid will have softened stances for sure. 

And yes I know all about people going back to their abusers and what not, but I’ll be honest this woman lives in the UK not some oppressive third world country, she could have moved on from him and that life and chose not to. 

If she won’t even move ahead with helping the police and wants to be with the guy then whatever, good luck to her is all I can say. Not sure what people expect from the courts or even United at that point.

Maybe they should just sell him? I’d be for that frankly. But if he’s brought back, meh, I won’t be pleased but I won’t blame the club either. Ronaldo’s victim maintained her accusations and everyone on this sub (barring a few) probably cheered all his goals. So let’s not pretend we have any moral high ground to begin with.",Manchester United,Yes,jarci2g,t1_jaqkkpm
Spot on,Manchester United,Yes,jaqmp35,t1_jaqkkpm
Email that to the manager. Pretty sure he have the final say.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqo2ug,t1_jaqkkpm
"Nah. He's not dynamic enough for Ten Hag's system. For the price being quoted for him, we can get two players who'd be a better fit.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqjeby,t1_jaqiohe
"Nope. I wouldn't want us playing Casemiro and Rice together, and Rice isn't going to come here and play backup to Case. Even if he was, we have more important positions to fill with the (minimum) £70m that Rice would cost.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqlth7,t1_jaqiohe
"Only if they go down, imo. He’s not worth (nor do we have) £100 that West Ham will want. But he is a solid player. Definitely in the category of player that would step up his game with better players around him.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqjiuq,t1_jaqiohe
we can’t spend like that though. FFP rules,Manchester United,Yes,jatiotn,t1_jat58aa
"Ronaldo didn’t play for two and a half years due to injury and came back to dominate the world cup
and win it with brazil",Manchester United,Yes,jaqev4r,t1_jaqeg7h
Luke Shaw. Out 1 year double broken leg.,Manchester United,Yes,jaql38z,t1_jaqeg7h
"Who knows? He was stagnating a little before all this, but that could have been due to poor coaching and the general atmosphere at the club.

Players come back from long injuries and are just as effective, and I'm sure Greenwood has been keeping himself in shape. If he does return, success would depend on him being receptive to coaching and prepared to work his arse off.

My gut tells me that he'd underwhelm and fade away, under the amount of scrutiny.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqjs40,t1_jaqeg7h
"yeah i think its quite common for players to miss a year or 18 months from big injuries. in his case, the bigger question is not match fitness or physical ability, 

its mental. Whether he's able to play in front of 30-60k fans chanting rapist every game. most ppl will get depressed after a month or so if they are so hated.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqgn0p,t1_jaqeg7h
"Probably means his ceiling has significantly dropped. 

Anyway he can fuck off to Turkey or Saudia & go about restoring his career there.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqf114,t1_jaqeg7h
Players get injured for long times and come back to peak fitness. Let's be honest it's not like he's been sitting on the couch for a year. He would have been training with personal trainers.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqeuho,t1_jaqeg7h
"Like how senior RM players protested against Ronaldo and Benzema playing? Or like how senior Arsenal players stopped Thomas Partey?

Let's not overestimate the moral compass of football players",Manchester United,Yes,jatxtrv,t1_jasxoq4
I'm curious as to what the hell the new evidence uncovered was. Feel like that needs to be revealed to get the full story on why this is even being considered,Manchester United,Yes,jat1sib,t1_jasxoq4
Doubt he ever will because can you imagine the boos he’ll get on and off the pitch,Manchester United,Yes,jatmbux,t1_jasxoq4
What did he say?,Manchester United,Yes,jastkbn,t1_jash7v6
I'd say fan and home. Player feels better to wear but it's less durable generally.,Manchester United,Yes,jat2ftd,t1_jasx5da
"rice is good player but way too overrated from what he actually is, plus west ham actually have overpriced him like crazy.",Manchester United,Yes,jarcw6y,t1_jar5xvb
good player but he's overpriced and overhyped. Rather go to south america and get a 20yo we can grow to become casemiro's successor,Manchester United,Yes,jargjq7,t1_jar5xvb
"I feel like it would be too defensive. Rice isn't a great passer and while he is capable of carrying the ball via dribbling, I feel like he doesn't do much with it afterwards.

We need someone more technical. Ideally speaking, Eriksen with more athleticism. De Jong really is the best fit.",Manchester United,Yes,jar8op6,t1_jar5xvb
50/60 mill max. west ham are insane if they think anyone not called chelsea is meeting their 150 mill price tag,Manchester United,Yes,jarlmwb,t1_jar5xvb
He’s really not that good imo,Manchester United,Yes,jat4r9y,t1_jar5xvb
We need someone who's the best of both worlds between Eriksen and Fred. Someone who's good creatively but can also defend. Rice doesn't satisfy that Imo.,Manchester United,Yes,jat01sc,t1_jar5xvb
Guess what they HAD in common?,Manchester United,Yes,jaquhg0,t1_jaqqw2t
"i still prefer sabitzer and casemiro but fred's in decent form so could be either.

i'd personally start sabitzer and casemiro so that we can be better on the ball and progression/buildup.

real q is whether rashford starts on the left or through the middle. do we want him up against the most overrated rb in pl history or embarrass van dickhead?",Manchester United,Yes,jaq5u4e,t1_jaq0xca
"If we have a lot of the ball then sub, if we are defending and playing on the counter, starter",Manchester United,Yes,jaq2byb,t1_jaq0xca
Sub... Fred is always better as a sub. He's been in good form along side Case. But that's about the only player he pairs well with lol. He and Sabi did not perform well together,Manchester United,Yes,jaq6npc,t1_jaq0xca
The fact that Casemiro considers him as one of the best talents in the squad tells you he can start. Also depends on the opposition. Look how he thwarted KDB in the derby. He's able to do both roles.,Manchester United,Yes,jaq7b7w,t1_jaq0xca
As a starter. He’s our best CM until Eriksen is back.,Manchester United,Yes,jaq2ark,t1_jaq0xca
"To be honest, depends on the match. I'd start him in a high intensity game such as liverpool but will bring him on around 70 mins otherwise.",Manchester United,Yes,jaq2a9w,t1_jaq0xca
Starter. He have chemistry with Casemiro. Then 70th can bring in Sabitzer or McT for added pressure or defend if we have the lead.,Manchester United,Yes,jaq16tj,t1_jaq0xca
It's the flair. On the website it's on the right side of the page where you can edit the flair.,Manchester United,Yes,jaq0mkf,t1_japyl0r
yeah i’d like to know too,Manchester United,Yes,jaq0abn,t1_japyl0r
Mata played well for us when called upon in the latter stages of his contract. And it's a shame no manager wanted to play him where he thrived for Chelsea.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqeak5,t1_jaqc09w
"Like what do you want to achieve with this? I'm not with it? 

Mata had more than 3 good years and yeah his contract got extended but he's moved on, thebclub have moved on and it's in the past. You're looking for random things to shout at",Manchester United,Yes,jaqc492,t1_jaqc09w
His main job scope is Youth mentor.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqlh8f,t1_jaqc09w
"He's a nice guy with a pretty face, don't expect him to be talked about like Jones the meme guy",Manchester United,Yes,jaqczl8,t1_jaqc09w
"Your life must be fucking exciting if this is what you do with it. Footys about moments not numbers on a screen, try to at least enjoy it",Manchester United,Yes,jaq1ln7,t1_japuij5
Fuck off.,Manchester United,Yes,japxcnt,t1_japuij5
"That sounds right.

My experience is you wait a while in the queue, then you look at a few matches and realise there is only hospitality tickets left.  
You keep looking and then get randomly kicked out back to the queue. When you get back in you finish checking the other matches and if you are lucky you might find some suitable tickets.

There is often quite a few singles dotted about, but buying multiple seats (close) together is harder.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqdlh0,t1_japxpgr
"If he/his people are feeding the press, it's all the more reason to not let him back imo.",Manchester United,No,jat4fyk,t1_jat37hx
I don’t think Mount is that special tbh. You could find plenty of young players in Europe that can do exactly what he does.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqadxj,t1_jaq2roz
"I mean, I get it. Yeah, it’s a little dry sometimes on this sub, but the alternative is having a bunch of low effort memes to sort through and people who think their shit reactionary opinions deserve their own post.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqaacp,t1_jaq5n7q
I agree. It's because we're playing every 3 days is why our momentum is rocking.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqfhli,t1_jaqbww5
">I don’t think I got that since Sir Alex’s time

We had multiple comebacks during Ole's tenure.",Manchester United,Yes,japm5g9,t1_japl447
A bunch of bouncing busby babes,Manchester United,Yes,japmu5k,t1_japm4zk
Odegaard would have been sent back to Norway crying.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqfj8s,t1_jaqaffv
We need a starting midfielder to play alongside Casemiro too. There is clearly a FdJ-shaped hole in our midfield.,Manchester United,Yes,jaq9x80,t1_jaq704f
"We have others pulling their own weight too, fred martial anthony at 6 goals, case and sancho at 5, few people at 4. There is huge improvement from our midfielders and our wingers. Football is a team game.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqf0sc,t1_jaq9kym
Just wondering what his path to first team would be if we buy a striker this summer. Rashford/garnacho on left and antony/Amad on the right is kinda what I was thinking.,Manchester United,Yes,japsp0q,t1_japrtd2
"The only problem is there really aren't many midfielders of De Jong's profile. He is a midfielder that progresses the ball via dribbling and breaks the press the same way. Frankly, I can't think of many similar players, maybe Kovacic?",Manchester United,Yes,jar9s7j,t1_jaqfg7n
"Straight swap for McSauce, easy done.

If McTominay was called Maco and came from La Masia he would be worth 200m",Manchester United,Yes,jaqd8r4,t1_jaqcw10
"If they get a left winger then he doesn't get into their starting XI, but I do think he will want to stay.",Manchester United,Yes,jar9uy0,t1_jaqcw10
"Eric Ramsey hasn’t left, he has joined Wales national team coaching staff in addition to his duties at Man Utd…",Manchester United,Yes,jaq76ir,t1_jaq6ma3
"He’s not leaving, he’s doing club and national duty at the same time.",Manchester United,Yes,jaq76t1,t1_jaq6ma3
I don't think he left.,Manchester United,Yes,jaq71ur,t1_jaq6ma3
Probably a little unfair to just call him the set piece coach (I know that’s not your intention) since I believe he does a lot more than that nowadays.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqa1ad,t1_jaq6ma3
Is he really overpriced though? 120-150m for a centre mid that could potentially be a starter for us for 10-15 years is worth it in today's market. A player of his ability at that age is incredibly rare to see,Manchester United,Yes,jat5w2w,t1_jaqan81
He’s expensive but not overpriced considering he’s one of the best young midfielders in the world,Manchester United,Yes,jax985t,t1_jaqan81
"Bellingham has proven it for far longer than both Enzo and Felix, possibly even combined. Lukaku was just bad business but under Conte he was world class",Manchester United,Yes,jat644t,t1_jaqbmmf
"We really need to go and sign a top third centre back soon. Someone like Timber. Look at City - they have Dias, Stones, Laporte, Akanji and Ake. Our drop off after Varane and Martinez is massive",Manchester United,Yes,jat6pns,t1_jaqrnwc
"| Too good to be a back-up | 

That's what we need if we want to challenge for all trophies . We need players who will not let us feel the absence of 1st team players if they get injured.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqmvzp,t1_jaqjl6p
Think 14m base. Owed like 17m. And they pay him very high bonuses and loyalties every year.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqr6r6,t1_jaqmsmh
Agreed but your points contradict your two “best” options IMO. Osimhen plays in Italy and Kane is somewhat past his prime (yes he can do a job into his 30s but that not his prime..),Manchester United,Yes,jaqqv2o,t1_jaqe6lg
"Yeah, Nani’s flip is the only one I’d count there as signature. The rest, as you say, we’re cycled through often or even just one offs.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqjsk1,t1_jaqjli4
No very true I just gave up straight away for Barca,Manchester United,Yes,jaqkjxh,t1_jaqk3g3
Do you pay for ballot before even being selected? As it’s asking for a payment,Manchester United,Yes,jaqqos6,t1_jaqk3g3
"They need to make 210M in sales before they can sign anyone, they’d need to gut their squad to do so and I can’t see that happening",Manchester United,Yes,jaqfexn,t1_jaqf8ds
"i pray for a romp but realistic, it’ll be closely match given how many games we have and had in schedule and needing to preserve this squad as much as possible for the long haul.",Manchester United,Yes,jaquacp,t1_jaqf7jj
"Seems so many don't care at all, so likely will cheer.",Manchester United,Yes,jash5ey,t1_jarlrup
So that he can flip to qataris for 2 billions profit in 10 years,Manchester United,Yes,jaqqhec,t1_jaqp4i6
"U tell me lol, old man is probably lonely and wants attention",Manchester United,Yes,jaqqhjs,t1_jaqp4i6
Be the token 'I tried' investor just like he did at Chelsea,Manchester United,Yes,jaqqikk,t1_jaqp4i6
"Jassim can probably clear it immediately, Jim can't. 

I'll ignore Jim over Qatar because that has been gone over enough time. 

The plus side to Jim over Glazer is theoretically decisions being made with the sporting side being the priority rather than the business side. Jim and INEOS will get money out of it of course but he wants to come in and get us competing again. 

With better people in charge of the sporting decisions over the last 10 years things would have been a lot different and the only issue really would be the stadium. 

There are ways to look after the debt that don't involve a Sheikh wiping it out in one go. It'll just take time.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqvl0p,t1_jaqp4i6
There is an incredible crossover with immense selfishness as the common factor. Both camps view football as more important than women’s rights.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqpvw2,t1_jaqo5ow
"Both show a lack of spine and morals ,If you can be fine with murderers and bigots owning the club then there is nothing stopping you from wanting a rapist at the club",Manchester United,Yes,jaqsehb,t1_jaqo5ow
"It's not a big jump in logic. Main argument against a Qatar bid is on morals. If we decide football has no morality, or at least that we shouldn't bring them into football decisions then Greenwood surely comes back in. He's got the ability, plays in a spot we need and is legally innocent. The reason people want him out is a moral question. 

The commenter did say ""some people"" and described the attitude of those people, they didn't say ""all people"". If there's a take where you want Qatar ownership because you are win at all costs but don't want Greenwood back it'd be good to hear rather than just calling people stupid.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqw3s2,t1_jaqo5ow
"Had the same thought but then the question is, which two good midfielders are available or will be willing to come to Utd. Considering the best position for Sabitzer, VDB is the one that we have seen Fred playing at with forward runs, and we need a proper CM/CDM role, what are our options?",Manchester United,Yes,jaqrvjr,t1_jaqjeby
Ffp isn't a real thing at this point. It's never enforced properly and as Boehly demonstrated there's ways to exploit it. Also I'd bet on us making like 50-70 odd million in sales,Manchester United,Yes,jatks8l,t1_jatiotn
"Still, Ronaldo was the best player in the world when he got injured, Greenwood wasn't even the best player in our squad. I would think a young player with potential would need constant coaching and direction, so unless he met up with Steve McClaren under a shady bridge every week, I'm still a bit in doubt",Manchester United,Yes,jaqf4uk,t1_jaqev4r
"A few goals, some melodramatic interviews from him and his girlfriend, and some PR drivel will reduce some of the hostility from home fans.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqisfs,t1_jaqgn0p
"The ideal situation would be EtH going ""You're shit mate hæh"" and sending him off to Guangzhou Evergrande",Manchester United,Yes,jaqf8nc,t1_jaqf114
Our squad is not built for 1/5th of a century.,Manchester United,Yes,jat8fhp,t1_jastkbn
"something about how our current team won't last 20 years. Not even an exaggeration, he literally said 20 (twenty) years. I know what he meant, but he's still so wrong.

The exact quote:

>""It is obviously not a team built up for the next 20 years because of the players they have signed. It is for now - but now they are really good.""",Manchester United,Yes,jatawtd,t1_jastkbn
Rice is overrated by this sub,Manchester United,Yes,jar9tyr,t1_jar8op6

I think Sabitzer is flippin quality and being an ex captain of Leipzig he be another leader in the dressing room!

"Unless rashford, garnacho or Antony can keep up their form next season. sancho should have enough game time since he is versatile to play anywhere across the front",Manchester United,Yes,japt4mk,t1_japsp0q
Maybe as a CAM to give Bruno rest when needed,Manchester United,Yes,japstcz,t1_japsp0q
He can fill in at several positions and offers a different type of ability to our other players on the wings. If he is in good form he will get plenty of chances to start. If he meets his potential he has the chance to become first choice on the right even depending on Antony/Amads/others growth.,Manchester United,Yes,jarxjk6,t1_japsp0q

Except it's a choice isn't it? You'd need to have a melted brain to say that everyone who supports Qatar takeover also supports Greenwood,Manchester United,Yes,jaqt4uk,t1_jaqsehb
"It's a huge jump in logic.

The issues with the qataris are what they get up to in their own country, completely out of the control of the UK and our way of life here and the atrocities committed will be done by their people, not by Manchester United employees. In addition due to the Qatari involvement coming down to the glazers greed, we have practically zero power to stop them getting involved.

Greenwood on the other hand has committed an atrocity in the UK, whilst being a Manchester United employee and the fans have a hell of a lot of power to oppose his return. As shipping out one player is an easily achievable task to put out the fire of fan outrage.",Manchester United,Yes,jar6y3b,t1_jaqw3s2
"I'd rather have Mac Allister than Rice, and think he'd be a good 8 alongside Casemiro.

also we never have got into FFP trouble, why would you want to?",Manchester United,Yes,jatsfm7,t1_jatks8l
Greenwood had a higher ceiling than rashford and was one of our best performers. players have missed far more time through injury and came back. it’s not like he’s just been eating maccies everyday. He’s probably been training every other day with personal trainers.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqfdmd,t1_jaqf4uk
"He has the money to pay for private coaching. Whether he did, we have no idea. He might just have been sitting in his house playing videogames, in between gym sessions, for the last year.

His finishing ability was remarkable, and players usually don't lose that, but Ten Hag demands a lot more from his strikers than the ability to put the ball in the net. 

Regardless, I think the decision here will come down to two things - will the club believe that Greenwood can convincingly show he's changed, and will the rest of the squad accept him back? He reportedly had few friends in the dressing room before this all broke.

I wish that I could say the opinions of the United Women's team would be taken into account too, but they likely won't be.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqq1fs,t1_jaqf4uk

"You a bit annoyed you have nothing to complain about these days now we are doing well? 

I'd have let Mata go aswell, but a mercenary? He put in some decent years at the club when there wasn't much to cheer about, and was well thought of around the place as a good figure in the dressing room. 

Even your entire point is based on some apparent anger at Jones and while it is an annoying case most fans have made peace with the Jones thing on compassionate grounds. Same with someone like Matic, he was past it but at least a leader in the dressing room.

Lingard 150k a week, the same as Mata after one good season, Pogba on 300k to play basketball in LA and flirt with other clubs, Dean Henderson on 150k and has more videos slagging off the club than starts, De Gea as much as I love him is not deserving to be made the highest earning keeper in history, Lukaku was on 200-250 and threw a strop because he wasn't guaranteed games, Alexis Sanchez was 300-450k with bonuses and never did a thing for us, Martial has had some excellent seasons but has barely played over the last few years for 250k a week. Never mind the likes of Falcao, Di Maria, Schewinsteiger who were all on an absolute bomb and barely contributed and two barely lasted. 

Long story short yeah our wage structure was mental over the last decade, this is not new. Despite the weird ""hey everyone angry at this guy should be angry at this guy too"" post you're throwing out this morning, there is a long list of people who top Mata in regard to being a mercenary 

Regardless, them days are behind us.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqf9lh,t1_jaqc8sq

"We won consistently after we were a goal down under Ole, people don’t give enough credit for what Ole achived. He got a 2nd place in the PL and reached a EL final and lost on pens. But i agree it wasn’t sustainable in the long run, and the team just collapsed last season.",Manchester United,Yes,jappl8a,t1_japm9yj
"Completely agree on Sabitzer, he's the real deal and I hope we lock him up. I hope that the FdJ saga from last summer was more about him wanting what he was owed by Barca, because if he's not committed, then I hope we don't go after him again.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqkupl,t1_jaqfl34
"Ideally, we buy Sabitzer and sell McTominay. Potentially making £10-15m on that deal. I think Sabitzer just needs a couple of goals and assists to seal the deal.

If we can get De Jong as well, that's an extremely solid midfield core - Case, Fred, Sabitzer, FDJ and Eriksen. Mainoo will keep developing as well. 

Send Iqbal out on loan if he can't get any game time. We'll have to see what Ten Hag makes of Hannibal in pre-season.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqqcjp,t1_jaqfl34

"Sabitzer has shown he can play there if needed. Not really something that would fix a possible long term injury of Casemiro, but as a backup he looked competent enough. His issue was that he kinda needs a partner who helps him out a bit and Fred doesn't always do that.",Manchester United,Yes,jar9cum,t1_jaqz2sb
"Van gaal won a trophy, case closed",Manchester United,Yes,japtbl8,t1_japrqro
"Exactly that. Eriksen is good for the first 60 mins but thats it. If West Ham do go down, Rice might just be the guy we need for 50m maybe? He'd want to leave and is definitely coachable",Manchester United,Yes,jar9t79,t1_jar9cum
"But he won't come to play as a backup and Rice-Casemiro is far too defensive of a midfield. It's like two DMs next to each other. Would it work? Like, sure, but we would struggle to score goals since both Eriksen/Fred are important at progressive actions next to Casemiro and Rice is worse than them in attack.",Manchester United,Yes,jara36w,t1_jar9t79
Agreed. Someone in FDJ's mould. Does our academy have any prospects in a natural cdm role. We tried McTominay but it isnt his natural position,Manchester United,Yes,jara9s7,t1_jara36w
"Yeah, De Jong would be the perfect partner for Casemiro. Just a shame it's so unlikely.

Our academy does possibly have players who are similar to FDJ, I think both Iqbal and Mainoo are good at dribbling and skipping past players in the midfield. They still need a lot of time to develop though.

As for pure DMs, we don't really have any. We should by a cheap young French DM to be backup for Casemiro if Sabitzer isn't enough.",Manchester United,Yes,jaraitc,t1_jara9s7

"One thing that really surprised me was how Garnacho just kept going yesterday. I thought he’d tire, but he looked just as fresh at the end of the game.

"This season really proves that so much of the shit players got in the previous seasons wasn’t ever their fault. Granted, call them out for jogging or having bad attitudes or any of that jazz.  But so much wasn’t on them.

McTominay was seen as “that academy player who sucks and should be sold ASAP. He’s trash. Just here for his academy status and doesn’t belong”. a lot of that is true in that he’s not a starter caliber of player. But now that he’s in a suitable role? We laugh at him being a target man. He sometimes plays as the 4th choice CM. It’s all good.

Fred was “inconsistent. Bad. Can’t pass. Can’t score. Sell him. “ and again. He has weaknesses. But now that he has a system that works (next to Casemiro who plays a good pivot + being a second choice)? Now he’s the workhorse who never gets tired. The guy who always smiles and is loved by his fellow teammates

Shaw went from being inconsistent to consistently being brilliant. And a lot of that was never his fault (probably). You need a coach who gives you a clear role and also defines your role based on the game and how you match up against the opposition. Now he also looks good at CB goddamn it. 

It’s similar shit for Marcus. Much of what he got hate for last season was “being predictable and a ball hog”. And it’s obviously a flaw in how he played. But any one who knows ball knows how good he is when he keeps it simple and runs on the last man. That’s what he did best even when he came in. Now give him a coach with a system that doesn’t allow him to try 20 step overs but instead puts him in the right spot? Brilliant.

Sancho got some personal time off and came back looking strong.

Martial looks good when fit and I’ve never heard anyone call him lazy off late.

AWB is looking good again. Dalot is turning into what we were promised when he joined.

DDG looks good again.

Bruno is back on top.

"Does anyone think Sancho might be a sneaky candidate to be sold this summer? 

Rashford and sometimes Garnacho are better on the LW (or at least both are direct and fast enough to trouble defenders 1v1 or on the break in a way Sancho can't). 

Antony is first choice at RW and while I'm sure Sancho would perform similarly or better in the Championship, Amad has had a promising loan and could come in for the backup RW. 

People say Sancho can transition to the 10 role, but he's doesn't have anywhere near the engine Bruno has and I hope we sign another CM such that Eriksen can be the deputy 10. 

I'm not saying we should sell him and obviously there's a ton of untapped potential, but if we needed to raise funds and you were to pick someone who was both surplus to needs AND able to fetch a decent fee, he sort of fits the bill.",Manchester United,No,janl76o,t3_11fs9be

"Always thought mctominay and maguire are overly scapegoated here but watching last night, I couldn’t get past how slowly they move the ball, inviting the other team to step up and gather confidence

Maguire seems to hate the idea of passing first time, so the person he passes to gets the ball under pressure and has to go backwards right away. Also doesn’t help that Scott hides and doesn’t ask for the ball from his cbs. And when he does get it, scott’s first instinct is to run with the ball rather than pass, again letting the defense adjust. I lost count of how many times I was screaming at the screen in the first half for one of them to pass the ball instead of walking it over to the recipient 

IMO that’s what casemiro changed the most: called for the ball from the cbs and moved it quickly, allowing us to bypass pressure and overload one side

Victor was also slow moving the ball but I’m giving him more leeway since he’s right footed on the left side which limits his distribution",Manchester United,No,jan9wi7,t3_11fs9be

"People need to be careful with praising yesterday's comeback or letting the result cloud what is really happening on the pitch.

We can't keep playing poorly and going behind like that, because the subs won't always rescue us or we won't be so lucky in from on goal, look at the goals we scored...own goal, individual brilliance from a fortunate rebound and then just a late Fred consolation that the defender was at fault for, similarly against Newcastle, yes we fought and defended well but before a set-piece and deflected goal we were poor, although Barca didn't create a lot we were still poor and didn't take control of the game until they scored then although we played better we relied on a shinner from Fred and a great goal from Antony that fell to him kindly, you can also touch on the Leicester and Leeds game for signs of serious problems starting and controlling matches.

Yes the fight, grit, determination that haven't been their before have allowed to get back in the above situations so the improvement is clear, but we need to be in control from minute one and we need to be creating chances and finishing them, not relying on deflections, mistakes and low chance long rangers.

I have a strong fear we'll lose to Liverpool on Sunday, we all know they're better on paper than they're showing and they'll be motivated against us, plus it's at their place, throw in our recent performances and the fact their players won't struggle to finish against us and our luck could potentially run out.",Manchester United,No,jam42qn,t3_11fs9be
"I am sick of this sub-obsession with Kane trying to shove down our throats. He is a 30-year man who loves his club and is their highest goal scorer. Even if they are Spurs why would he ask to leave like some fans claim he is sick of the club? He is not sort of guy who will hand transfer requests like some people are claiming or is eager to join us.

Likewise, he isn't some sort of messiah. He is a striker who will soon pass his peak and why should we blow half our transfer budget on this guy? Knowing how bitter of a man Levy is he would rather let him go for free than sent him to their rival or ask 120 m for him.

This transfer makes absolutely no sense apart from pleasing some of the people who have this weird obsession with seeing Kane in United shirt. Kinda similar to Ronnie return but that actually made sense because he was already someone whom we had fond memories with \]. With Kane I don't even understand this weird obsession as the club doesn't even have a remote connection with him.

"Can I be honest? I’m really just not on board with all the Weghorst gushing/admiration. At least to the degree/lengths that some people are going in regard to wanting us to sign him permanently.

I fully recognize and appreciate that he puts in a shift and hustles his ass off, but he really does miss a ton of golden opportunities and we have been so lucky to not have been burned by them. 

Randomly, I am a bit of a Wolfsburg fan. I remember when he played for them, and his chance wasting was very similar. He’d get 4/5 great chances a game, chances that if martial had missed for us people would be calling for his head on a platter. Wout would score one of those chances and it would really hide the fact that he missed so many. 

I think ETH and the coaching staff have worked a minor miracle finding a way that we could use/utilize Weghorst. Lets not act that this drop deep false 10 type role is what he was asked to do from game one. We initially tried to have him be a traditional bit 9 target man, and it pretty much flopped. 

If you guys feel we need a hard working, run their legs into the ground for the cause/tactical press type striker, you really don’t need to look any further than Victor Osimhen. He literally presses and works just as hard as Wout, but has the pace of Rashford. Oh and he is a fantastic finisher. If you have a chance, go watch his performance from last weeks game against Empoli. Specifically around the 67 min mark after Napoli got a red card. The effort and press led by him despite his team being down a man is phenomenal. 

I’m not trying to say Wout isn’t a likable player who truly gives his all for the cause of the team. I appreciate the shifts that he is putting in, but I’d be lying if I didn’t say I wish we had a healthy Maritial in the team right now and  the calls for Weghorst to be signed on a permanent deal are just way over the top.",Manchester United,No,jalb80g,t3_11fs9be

"Wait, if they were not even in the same league then what's the issue?",Manchester United,Yes,jalw2k3,t1_jalvvo5

"It helps that Weghorst’s pressing is smart too, not just aimless running. He always approaches the opposition player at an angle so he narrows down their options significantly.

I remember last season pressing with some players sprinting head on towards an opposition defender only for them to kick the ball slightly left or right to a teammate. It looked so amateur",Manchester United,Yes,jan3nh3,t1_jamr1u3
Weird flashback to him playing CB for us in Australia less than 8 months ago,Manchester United,Yes,jaouk6r,t1_jansmcx
I can't see a path back for him. Shaw has that position locked down and Malacia is more than capable. Though who knows how he would improve under ETH and with half a dozen Portuguese speakers.,Manchester United,Yes,janze0h,t1_jansmcx
"seems like he has been in and out of Seville team so far, 8 starts plus 7 sub appearances in la liga so I’m not sure that’s a likely permanent destination for him as they won’t commit to his wages if he isn’t a 1st team regular (he is on about 90k pw here I believe which for Seville is big money)

Have a feeling he will either be moved on in the summer for a nominal fee (5 mill or so) or will spend final year of his contract out on loan again

Would be quite surprised if he ever plays for us again given how well shaw has done this year and the potential of malacia",Manchester United,Yes,janz04e,t1_jansmcx

"The only case I can make is that our last 5 games is decent run in (only fulham in current top half and that’s at old Trafford) so if we can get to let 5 games within say 5 points then the pressure of a run in might affect the rivals, Arsenal in particular

"I love De Gea, he is one of the best around when our defense crumbles and we need a miracle save, but I really don't know how sustainable our football can be him with him in goal. We don't involve him in the build up because Ten Hag doesn't trust his passing so we have one less player in the build up phase. We are making it work, but it's more difficult than it needs to be.

It's true De Gea has been very good at what he does best this season, he has saved us some points and he isn't a complete liability on the ball anymore so that's good. We aren't desperate to replace him with any semi-decent modern keeper anymore. However, there are a few names that would be big upgrades, Diogo Costa being one of them.",Manchester United,Yes,jambl5u,t1_jam5qt4

3. We are terrible at selling players. Last year about 6 players left on a free. We shouldn't be selling Rashford, but we need to be regularly getting about £10M for some academy players and about £30M for more established players who no longer suit us",Manchester United,Yes,jann4gn,t1_jang8fe

"Makes sense tbh - all Greenwood discussion aside, there are a lot of people who strictly want the most talented players on the pitch.

"Below par but there is mitigating circumstances. As we speed up our play, he’ll be better - but there’s no denying we got bumped by Dortmund.

"Has definitely been underwhelming & hasn't justified his huge fee.

Mitigating factors; Last season was a proper shitshow & didn't give him a good platform to bed into the team. He's had to deal with personal matters that meant he didn't build the same momentum as the team has over the last 6 months.

Positives;  Still 22 (23 end month) so can still develop into the elite player we know he can become. Has come up with clutch goals in crucial moments for us, what we just need is that more consistently. 

I trust in Ten Hag & can see him turning Sancho into a beast.",Manchester United,Yes,jalupak,t1_jaltb1b
"The price and contract are out of his control and are high due to Woodwards shit negotiating tactics. He's clearly a talented player and has been suffering mentally, potentially from being in the United Squad during the last few depressing years. Under ETH, everyone's getting better, so I'm excited to see him more",Manchester United,Yes,jalx0nc,t1_jaltb1b
"I still rate him heavily because I know what he is capable of when he is well. Barring one or two random times when he was actually not well, anytime you see ""Ill"" it's mental health related. I'm glad the stigma around athletics has changed because, mental health really can destroy your physical attributes. He's surrounded by a place and team of love and great doctors at United now - watch this space after March and next season, you won't believe you ever doubted him and Antony.",Manchester United,Yes,jam1k22,t1_jaltb1b
"Last season was utter dogshit for everyone and this season he’s had his off the field issues.

I won’t race to judgement and call him a flop just yet, but it’s fair to say he’s been quite underwhelming since his transfer.  

I’d probably give him until the end of next season to see if he can turn it around and I’d not start actively looking to sell.  If Greenwood returns then Jadon could realistically be out 6th choice wide man, and that wage for a fringe player just isn’t justifiable.",Manchester United,Yes,jalwtbv,t1_jaltb1b
"Jury's still out for sure but I do have hopes for him. Clear to see that Erik doesn't really see him as a pacey winger a la Garnacho, Antony and is playing him a lot more centrally which is where he'll thrive a lot more.",Manchester United,Yes,jaltwig,t1_jaltb1b
"Little bit of an awkward situation in my opinion. I think when we become more of a 'Ten Hag team', in that we start taking more control in games and having more sustained attacking pressure, with his close control and ability to pass in crowded areas he could do really well. 

I don't think he's dynamic or athletic enough to excel in the side currently. If we're looking at signing a top striker in the summer, Rashford will be a constant on the left with Garnacho his backup which leaves Sancho behind Bruno as the #10 and behind Antony on the right, with a decision to be made over Amad as well. Given his wages I think it's hard to justify him in that sort of role.",Manchester United,Yes,jam2s10,t1_jaltb1b

Lol,Manchester United,Yes,jam4j5g,t1_jam42qn
"I do agree with parts of it. But not everything.

Yes. The chances of us signing him are slim given that he’s not unhappy at Tottenham and the club loves him. He’s one of their best players ever. He’s historically relevant but also brilliant today. So low odds he moves. And even if he does. The price will be insane.

But that said. The 30 year old thing is bullshit given that this isn’t FIFA and there’s no “on switch” for regression that kicks in this season. His style of play isn’t centered in insane running speeds or miles covered like some other players (Mbappe first to come to mind). He won’t suddenly fall off a cliff. That’s unfair. You get at least 3 world class seasons from him in which time you bring up new talent.

I’d see him being similar to RVP. And in that vein.

The team rn has 10 quality starters to depend upon (assuming you don’t think we need a new GK). Striker is our only concern. Rashford is our only goal scorer and that’s not ideal. If ETH thinks that there’s a young striker he’d rather have, or just believes in; then I respect that. He knows the game better than I ever will. But. Let’s not forget that Kane is the closest thing to a sure shot we can ever find in this market.

He’s not switching levels of competition or countries. He fits the style ETH wants being a striker who can play in the buildup similar to what he asked of Martial. Plus he was extremely successful in a goal scoring duo with Son. Whether they tel as players and people is yet to be seen. But they have the makings of a successful deep lying forward and the winger who runs off his shoulder.

On paper. The only clash would be how Bruno and him fit together. But then again. Bruno could play more to the right or something. Having all three of them is a good problem to have.

We are currently dark horses for a PL title charge. We destroyed a Barca team that pundits and fans have been pulling hard for and praising.

I’d be apprehensive of the price and age if we were a shit team and needed 10 new starters. But this isn’t that.

Also. With age. YeahZ players decline. But what made Ronaldo and Sanchez bad moves wasn’t just age.  It more that they were already declining.

Arsenal fans always knew. I think Juve fans knew too.

Kane has don’t anything but show signs of regressing",Manchester United,Yes,jan55ct,t1_jamxo1e
"He told Spurs he wanted to leave in 2021. He's also made no secret of the fact he wants to win trophies. It's a big possibility that he pushes for a move soon. Kane will also be a top striker well into his 30s. Why on earth would you not want Kane? A guy who guarantees goals and has an amazing all round game too

I'd personally prefer Osimhen but if Kane becomes available and Osimhen isn't then obviously we should be all over him",Manchester United,Yes,jan197h,t1_jamxo1e
"Why he would want to leave :- to win an actual trophy

Why he would want to join us :- to win an actual trophy

"People gush because we got a player who is a solid fit when we had no money and really needed an extra body. Imagine our season without Weghorst. 

I don’t care if we keep him permanently and yes he’s a limited player but I’ll always remember him fondly just for how he never stops running even though he starts every single match. 

You talking about Osimhen, that’s nice, do we have 150 mil to sign him?

No one thinks Wout is our long term CF. It’s just nice to see a guy come in last moment for next to no financial commitment and make a solid impact.",Manchester United,Yes,jaldhcr,t1_jalb80g
"Weghorst is much more valuable to the team than Martial, simply because of availability. Even a terrible player (which he is not) will score at least some fluke goals sometimes, which will be more than a good player who is permainjured

I do not mind signing Weghorst for about 10m in the summer to be BACKUP to whoever we sign as starting striker at all",Manchester United,Yes,jalg0x8,t1_jalb80g
">I fully recognize and appreciate that he puts in a shift and hustles his ass off, but he really does miss a ton of golden opportunities and we have been so lucky to not have been burned by them.

I wont even read the wall of text you have written after that. 

What golden chances are these that he misses? Chances? Sure. Golden? No way. I can easily point out to Rashy, Sancho, Garnacho, Antony and Bruno missing plenty of golden chances through out the season. 

You have completely missed the point if you think ""hustle bustle"" is all he brings. He is an extremely technical player, and ties up a lot of our forward players with great passing, lay offs, and just brutal physicality in the box and runs, that opens up space for others to have these ""golden chances"". 

I live in Germany, for work, and have quite a few Wolfsburg fans around me, and they bang on about one particular thing: You buy Weghorst to due the role of Giroud in your team, and not one of a Kane, Haaland or Oshimen. This is what Burnley fucked up at. We are clearly doing extremely well with our team, as he is the first point of pressing, and is excellent at through balls and layoffs. That ain't just ""hustle bustle"".",Manchester United,Yes,jalcbac,t1_jalb80g
"Well, he gives us tactical flexibility. He can be a decent backup striker even if we sign a new striker this summer. Martial is just unreliable.

There's nothing to lose if we sign him and he wants to be a second choice striker. His strengths outweigh his weaknesses, his finishing isn't good but he helps others score by pressing high, dragging defenders, providing assists, and linking up with other players. Weghorst gives his all for the club and fans love this type of player.",Manchester United,Yes,jalbv6q,t1_jalb80g
"Sorry pal, you're just milea off. 

Weghorst was bought as a sub in the middle of a shortage. It isn't a question of him or Osihmen.",Manchester United,Yes,jalij2i,t1_jalb80g
"And Osimhen wont work out with Rashy or Antony, he needs Sancho or Bruno to play wide and create chances, go watch Napoli matches, without Kvara, Osimhen wont be effective.

"Nobody is saying let's keep him as our number 9 next season, I am not really sure why you have spent all this time to write this out.

The guy was signed as a stop gap to do a job for us where we were lacking and didn't have funds to buy anyone. He might not have scored goals but if we are winning games and he is contributing towards that then he is more than his worth in terms of the deal and I think would be a great option for our squad.

Yeah having Martial would be great, but we don't because the guy is made of glass whereas Weghorst puts a massive shift in every game and doesn't seem to tire. So I know who I would rather have",Manchester United,Yes,jalvr5w,t1_jalb80g

"Few recent examples of our failings in transfer market:

Williams would have been a 10mill player that half the PL would have had a punt on had we not given him a long term 60k pw deal rendering his wages unaffordable to most bottom half / mid table PL clubs

Tuanzebe after his successful loan at villa and then getting promoted was being linked with 30mill permanent move, we kept him around, never really used bar to cover CB injury emergencies and he has been unfortunate with injuries himself since and will now surely leave on a free this coming summer

Lingard after successful loan could have commanded 20mill fee, we apparantly wanted 30mill, he hardly played the following year while picking up 100k pw then left on a free

Henderson probably for last 3 summers we could have gotten 20-30mill fee. He has spent 1 season rotating the cup games, 1 with practically no game time for us, and now 1 on loan at forest

Speaking of forest, moneybags Forrest would surely have paid 15-20mill for garner last summer at start of window but we dithered, ended up selling at end of window when forest had already secured other targets so we got at the time what looked like a poor price of 9mill

Feel like those examples (all academy graduates) could have secured us somewhere better 100 and 120 mill, enough to sign potentially 2 or 3 first team starting 11 quality players. So far only garner has generated a fee lingard has left on a free, tuanzebe surely will this summer, Williams might get us 5million and Henderson potentially might still get us around 20mill but his salary limits the fee clubs will pay for him. we have left alot of money on the table with that lot",Manchester United,Yes,jao2qom,t1_jann4gn
There’s gotta be translators and interviewers who can speak Spanish from us,Manchester United,Yes,jal9j1m,t1_jal9gd3
"Yeah I do too but looking at the squad and its strengths and weaknesses, if someone like FDJ was available but we could only make the move if we sold Sancho, I think the squad is better off if we make the deal. 

Not saying it's likely just that Sancho is a player with resale value that we probably could spare.",Manchester United,Yes,janogan,t1_jannujf
"Would Bayern be a shout? He has massive reputation in Germany still and set that league alight for a couple years, Bayern maybe the only German club that could put a transfer package together that could tempt us to sell and sancho to go. Only other club I can think of is Chelsea if they wanna boost their English quote

Realistically though I think he gets at least 1 more year to show his potential here. I’m hoping he can get over all these illnesses he has been having and can get a consistent period where he is available between now and end of the season

Feel like next preseason is gonna he huge for him, make an impression and he can work his way back into team (he is still super young) but if he struggles for rest of season and doesn’t standout in preseason he could fall further down the pecking order with garnacho further establishing himself and potentially amad coming back in too to try and cement a place in 1st team squad",Manchester United,Yes,jao09ky,t1_jansia7
Thanks for the reply! Very informative.,Manchester United,Yes,jalj7bn,t1_jal5tsl
"Probably not the main reason to keep them around but we literally have a quota of homegrown players that we need to keep so we can register full 25 man PL squad (8homegrown minimum) and we are actually quite close to that at the moment

Last summer perreira, lingard, pogba all left. Of homegrown players currently contracted, Greenwood might never play for us again. Henderson will probably be sold as he isn’t happy to be a backup and I don’t think he is getting the number 1 jersey next season, tuanzebe / Jones almost certain to leave on frees, heaton is old and contract up in summer though I hope/think we try to keep him as backup for another season, no space in squad for Williams who will surely be sold, awb is impressing atm but it’s pretty clear as recently as January ETH would have been happy to cash in had a replacement been available. There is question marks over Sancho suitability in ETH team. Even rashford and shaw are coming Into final year of contract though I think it’s clear we will try to retain both

So that leaves mcT and maguire…. I think maguire will possibly leave as probably knows he isn’t breaking up the licha / varane partnership and I think we might actually target another CB in the summer too. If mcT is happy to stay around as a backup / depth option which I think is more likely than maguire wanting to stay as a backup then I think we should absolutely keep him

Sourcing homegrown players to fill that quota isn’t cheap!!

I guess the club will hope that garnacho, mainoo, elanga, mejbri plus others who already do or could all qualify as homegrown will in long term help us maintain required quota",Manchester United,Yes,jao5p81,t1_janswei
"The set pieces are something which he is truly world class at other than technically he would definitely be an improvement on our squad options, has an eye for a pass finishes fairly well for a midfielder and he runs his socks off too.",Manchester United,Yes,jalz027,t1_jalyi3i
">He'd be a huge upgrade on current squad rotation players

"If he wants trophies he can go to any top club in the world. Pretty sure Bayern, real Madrid or Bayern all guarantee that. Really idiotic argument to make on why he wants to join us.

>he's a world class striker who doesn't rely on pace and would immediately elevate our team and help us win trophies for 4/5 years

Again with a lame assumption. We don't even know if ETH wants him or he would be suited for his style. Its clear he wants De Jong because he fits his system but why would he want a 30-year-old striker with no pace who will cost north of 100 m on his team?

He will help us with trophies when he hasn't won a single trophy all his life. Lmao. ok.",Manchester United,Yes,jan373n,t1_jan1hh1

Also your point doesn’t really make sense. Why wouldn’t we want a player to finish off the chances created by Bruno and Sancho? That would away the over reliance on Rashford.",Manchester United,Yes,jalszqg,t1_jals599

"Absolutely. But we're already seeing some evidence that he's working on that. Last night was the best I've seen of him defensively - closing down and being switched on to overlapping runs.

Ireland actually,Manchester United,Yes,jalmnp2,t1_jalc52z
"You should read up on his interviews on where he prefers to play or where he plays for Argentina. He is exactly like Sabitzer was for RB. A box to box player who prefers to be more on the creative side of things. Not as creative as Bruno or KDB, neither as defensive as Casemiro. 

He plays a double pivot in Brighton, but the defensive duties are shared with Caicedo doing majority of it. Just because he picks up from deeper positions, doesn't mean he isn't a box to box player.",Manchester United,Yes,jalfwr5,t1_jalfn1i
"He would be an upgrade in Fred and Scott. He can play Rm or Central. Fred's current form is brilliant, but he hasn't been playing like this for the last 5 years, so although he won't have his energy, he is a better footballer",Manchester United,Yes,jamhhwo,t1_jam0664

"Mm no he can’t go to any top club in the world. He only (barely) speaks English and has stated that he would only ever stay in England due to his family.

">Smarter business would be tielemans or rabiot on a free

Even more smart business would be not touching Rabiot at all.

Also, Sabitzer is well better than Tielemans; the latter was always gassed out by 65 minutes even in his prime. And they're different players to begin with.

Sabitzer has taken to the league as duck to water. He's been on the bench at Bayern for 6 months, came here about a month ago; new team, new manager, new league/country; and yet he's slotted in right away. After a good pre-season he'll even be better.",Manchester United,Yes,jalirey,t1_jaliecs

Well I'm sure glad you're not manager,Manchester United,Yes,jalnsyb,t1_jaliecs
"Yeah on a permanent deal as a squad player, not let's sign him instead of a new number 9. Martial can't even make the bench 70% of the time so we still need 2 strikers realistically.

"That’s different - I agree we can improve certain positions, but which team can’t?",Manchester United,Yes,jalwhs5,t1_jalw1gw
"Really? Because I believe 2 last seasons Barca were quite a mess. Of course they could still be in top 3-4 lol it's La Liga not EPL, however, I remember Barca fans moaned as hell 2 last seasons, especially since Messi left.",Manchester United,Yes,jalybvp,t1_jaly2h4

JWP has been playing bang average for the last 5 years though. So I'm not sure how anyone can say that he can be as good as Fred is right now?,Manchester United,Yes,jamosc2,t1_jamhhwo
I don’t agree I think with the limited budget that we have that money can be better spent on actually upgrading our starting XI instead of buying players to sit on the bench. If we want a decent midfielder who can sit on the bench there’s cheaper options out there like tielemans or rabiot(who ten hag wanted btw),Manchester United,Yes,jaljpzc,t1_jalirey
"These are objectively good players and would be free + younger. Allowing us to free up funds to get better players for the starting XI, I don’t see how it’s not smarter. Ten hag also wanted rabiot so it’s not like he’s a shit player.",Manchester United,Yes,jallqae,t1_jalljvq

"Not to be picky you did say no one is saying sign him permanently. Now it’s yeah but as a squad player. 

As I said in another response clearly most people don’t feel the same way I do. That’s fine and I respect it. But I will say, it is funny how so many people complain about having dead wood at the club and are so ready to get rid of players from our own academy, who also hustle their asses off for the badge. Yet Wout comes in, does the same types of things and we get excited about it because it’s new. 

If we sign Wout permanently, I can almost guarantee that in a year the negative comments you see written about McTominay or Elanga will be said about Wout.",Manchester United,Yes,jam5po8,t1_jam4vdw

2) Levy has spent 300 million since his depature and playing Poch's brand of aggressive football would need athletic players so its not that if Poch comes he wont ask for new players. If anything a manager who plays with a front foot would demand more players than a manager with a mid-block

3) This isnt the ""Same squad"" which let Poch down. There are only Kane, Son, Lloris, Lucas, Sanchez, Dier, Davies. Out of that Lucas is leaving, Lloris would also leave, and Poch wanted Dier gone which I am sure of",Spurs,No,jb03g32,t3_11ip9xr

"The only players Arteta has kept around that were at the club before him that are considered part of his 14-15 best players are Saka and Martinelli, who were both basically youth players and extremely motivated to prove themselves to Arteta.

Is it really a coincidence that it took replacing literally all of the other players in order for them to look like a competent team again, going from 5th to 1st? Jesus and Zinchenko have been good for them but definitely aren't the biggest factor, considering they've been injured for large parts of the season and their team still plays well.

The biggest factor was getting rid of Laca, Bellerin, Pepe, Leno, Torreira and Maitland Niles in the summer. You need hungry players if you want to progress.

Compare that to our team. Son, Kane, Lloris, Dier, Davies are all considered starters in our strongest XI. That's the spine and about half of the squad that's slowly rotted over what, 6+ years?

Smith Rowe was brought on to at 22nd minute to replace an injured Trossard, and then himself was subbed by R. Nelson at 69 mins. He turned out to be the match winner at the very end.

Ten Hag has also done the same to win some games when levels dropped in some games at Man United. Using bench players to change tactics and change games.

Would Conte and the coaching team have done the same? I think he has the capability to do so, but it's beginning to look the same sad story every match we are stuck at 0-0 or behind.

"One of the worst things about our switch to defensive managers is that it’s now become our brand in the media and among other fans

How many times have you heard commentators casually talk about how we “don’t mind not having the ball” or “like to sit back” or “thrive on the counter” against teams clearly worse than us?

All those things are largely true but as a relatively younger fan (dunno what things were like in the 90s) it’s such a departure from the Spurs I remember watching in the late 2000s and 2010s and it’s kinda upsetting realising playing boring football has become our “brand”

I’d rather be the team that wins a chaotic 4-3 and then loses a crazy 3-2 the very next game than be the team who wins a reasonably boring 2-0 one game and then loses a dreadful 1-0 the next

I know we aren't playing well and everyone is blaming son and perisic, but I just feel like we play with less ferocity than last season, maybe we were playing with fire under our ass to secure top 4, but now it just feels like we are cruising.

My only guess is that we are in a mesh of all factors going wrong at the wrong time. Bunch of tired players from the world cup, Conte's personal tragedies, lack of rotation for some of our key players, too many games to play from the world cup being squeezed.

"I sadly think that we have to crash and burn to be successful in the future, otherwise we’ll continue to sleepwalk towards mediocrity.

Levy still thinks that his bullshit way of running the  club will get us top 4 every year, and in the past decade it has or has come close to. Not enough investment In the squad, no strategy, no long term plan, bad buys and changing managers every time top 4 seems to be in danger. We need to spend a couple seasons midtable for him to understand that it doesn’t work like that anymore, especially when Son and Kane are gone who have been carrying us for years. 

The only way to be successful nowadays is to through a long term strategy when it comes to squad building and showing faith in a manager, especially when you can see that he is building something. Consistent investment in the squad, especially into quality over quantity, something this club knows nothing about. We need to start buying seasoned players In their prime for 35-50m, instead we go and spend 20-25m on youngsters that are nowhere near the required level and turn out to be a complete waste. 

Get in an attacking manager  that plays possession based attacking football and give him time. Allow him to build a squad. Sacrifice top 4 for a few years. But these owners only want to increase the value of the club, it’s an investment to them and nothing else. Best way to do that without having to spend much is scrapping 4th place every season, it gives you a lot of money and raises the profile of the club being in the biggest competition, so you can then in return ask for more when a buyer comes sniffing or when we try to sell the stadium rights.",Spurs,No,jazgisj,t3_11ip9xr

Mourinho was the same thing, Was losing Toby and Jan due to old age and got Joe Rodon. 

Conte had the same thing, Bentancur and Kulusevski are the only ones to save themselves, if you consider that Romero came in for Nuno (he made us proud), but other than that we are forced to watch Dier and Sanchez play Cb because we have no one better, summer window has been a mess, yes partially because of conte (perisic), but my point still the same, the recruitment has been failing the team and mainly the MANAGERS.

I do also think hes inherited an absolute mess, in Pochs days we had quality players and havent gotten near to replacing them, however pochs philosophy worked perfectly with young hungry players so he was able to develop them.

I do think were signing young quality players again which is great but I do question what the clubs plan is, we sign Conte, ready made manager and yet we sign the opposite of players he wants to sign. 

At the end of the day, the clubs sending mixed messages, pick a side and stick with it, if we commit to Conte then sign ready players, now were in this weird confused state where the players arent mentally ready and it shows on the pitch.

I have no doubt that Conte will leave at the end of the season, 15m contract per season isnt good value for what were getting.

"If we move to a 4-3-3/4–2-3-1 I the summer, which positions would you reinforce with either starters/squad players? Obviously keep it sort of realistic since in reality half the squad needs to be changers

I think first choice GK, LCB and creative mid are absolute must’s. We’ll be in big trouble if those 3 positions don’t get done. Another almost must will be a new forward, preferably LW. Son has been terrible for 2/3 of a season by this point and will be 31, It would be a mistake to further rely on him. Kane is backed up by Richy and Kulu can be backed up by either Gil or Perisic. 

Fullbacks should not be a priority this summer, Porro&Royal on the right with Udogie/ Davies/Reggie on the left is decent enough for now. Sess needs to be  binned asap.

Midfield is sort of alright, with Bentacur coming back halfway through next season I think we’ll be ok. But we need to get the Creative Mid at all costs. Have GLC back him up, not ideal but it is what it is. 

LCB is huge one and we need to bring in quality to be paired with Romero. It doesn’t have to be Gvardiol but it has to be better than Guehi for example. Also another CB as depth, we can’t rely on Sanchez,Dier and Tanganga in a back 4, even as squad players.

"I'm curious.  I'm not from UK and didn't grow up watching EPL (or its predecessor).  I have no prior experience and I'm observing from a distance.  I guess I'm saying that I didn't build up animosity for our rivals from my youth, proximity to other fans, and prior disappointments.  For instance, I can imagine that if one lives near Tottenham then they are exposed to lots of Arsenal fans.  I can readily see how lifelong animus can develop.  I have a strong dislike for my football team's nearest geographic rivals in American football.   

For those of you from the UK can you rank your level of vitriol for other top 6 teams---and maybe why you have them in that order.  

for example here is mine.  remember I live an ocean away and was not a fan until my 60's about 10 years ago.

1. Chelsea--as a newcomer, I studied the history of the prominent EPL teams.  My research indicated that Chelsea had the vilest fans in terms of racism and other bad behavior.   Russian oligarch oil money. the hated Diego Costa played for them 2014-2017 in my formative years.  Plus, I've been told that parts of Chelsea are among the most wealthy in London.
2. Arsenal---I'm Spurs.  Fortunately, I didn't suffer through the early EPL Wenger period.  I don't know many Gooners.  Where I live there are a couple of very active Spurs fan clubs as visible as any Arsenal fan clubs.
3. ManCity--Fuck oil money.
4. ManU--like Arsenal, I've not experienced a real dominant period by United.  I understand how globally massive they are, but again not where I live.
5. Liverpool--Liverpool is by far the most popular EPL team in my area.  I enjoy their local fan club and generally root for them when not playing Spurs or unless their loss would benefit the Spurs.

An express ticket to pissing me off,Spurs,Yes,jazuxsl,t1_jazsvxf
Spurs,Spurs,Yes,jazt7du,t1_jazsvxf
"Well, my thinking is that Kane has told the team that if he wins the free kick, he's taking it. No questions (Perisic won the free kick that Porro hit the bar from and Kane won the free kick that he took himself). 

He definitely should have given that free kick to Porro though for the sake of the team, I feel like he has the scoring record in his head now. Ngl I feel like that was really selfish from Kane considering Porro's in the first half was the best direct free kick I think we've seen in years (I can't remember our last direct free kick goal?)",Spurs,Yes,jb0clzd,t1_jazsvxf
"At this point Kane is desperate to get goals so that he can get at least some kind of personal accolade whilst he's in a team that won't win anything.

Sad thing is that we could actually win some of the games where he wastes our dangerous free kicks :/",Spurs,Yes,jb00rtr,t1_jazsvxf
It's contractual,Spurs,Yes,jazw8un,t1_jazsvxf
"This is the mad thing. We had 2 title runs, a load of semis and champs league final.

That's actually quality and not a million miles off what klopp managed at Liverpool, just klopp managed to get it over the line more often and hence why is considered a better manager. And poch did all this whilst barely spending. 

Even at the dumpster fire that is PSG he managed to win the league at a canter. Didn't get UCL but neither has Tuchel Ancellotti Emery or any of them. 

I get being cautious about going back and maybe there is a better option out there, but he's certainly not a bad option to have at all. And the football would be....watchable!",Spurs,Yes,jb05aen,t1_jb03g32
"The biggest problem will be that  we don’t have young energetic players anymore. We can’t counter press like we used to. Kane and Son are 30 now and can’t really press. Our only really good pressing comes from Kulu and Bentancur. Hojbjerg is way too slow. Plus our defence would be a complete disaster if they tried to play a high line. 

Even if Poch comes we won’t be able to play that style of play we had before. I don’t think he would be a good fit for us right now.",Spurs,Yes,jb04pj8,t1_jb03g32
"I get all of that, but IMO Poch makes more sense as a plan C. Pochettino also had problems with making substitutions and he kind of lost the dressing room at the end. I also remember Kane and Poch not really getting along at the end (which might be more on Kane but the point is the same). 

Also imo, I just think De Zerbi and Gallardo are much more exciting options than Pochettino is, so I want us to shoot our shot with them first. I wouldn't mind bringing Poch back though.

"In that timeline we probs see Poch get sacked and an extension of the post-Bale era with maybe 1-2 CL qualifications in that time till present day if we stumbled on a good group of players

"TBH, I'll definitely take that.",Spurs,Yes,jb0jrss,t1_jazknte
"I'd rather lose Kane and bring Poch back than keep Kane and hire someone like Glasner. I also think Kane would probably leave under most of our choices anyways. I think the only manager Kane probably would have stayed under was Tuchel.

(who I like a lot more than Glasner but I think I might prefer Poch at this point but I do like Tuchel).",Spurs,Yes,jb0rp6z,t1_jb0qw2r
Arsenal turned it around when they reshuffled their board and recruitment. Funny that.,Spurs,Yes,jb0etrk,t1_jb0ar0s
"Complacency might be one explanation, but perhaps there are other explanation. Maybe despair? Lost of hope that things might improve after many attempts?",Spurs,Yes,jb0bea2,t1_jb0ar0s
"You need continual churn.  That doesn't mean that you have to get rid of players, but you need competition and to keep selecting the best out of that churn.

At Spurs until recently we seem to have a general mindset of - ""buy youngsters who will grow into the team"".  That means most of our best players are not competing for their position, and the results speak for themselves - with the exception of Kane and Son - who are basically outliers in the EPL in terms of the culture/mindset.",Spurs,Yes,jb0nig1,t1_jb0ar0s
"I mean don't forget he signed Willian and also was the one who offered Aubameyang a huge new contract.

It's also just the narrative atm. If they start dropping points and City win the title then all the narrative will be ""theu didn't have enough experience and know how, the young players didn't have the mentality""",Spurs,Yes,jb0k8rk,t1_jb0ar0s
"I honestly didn't even watch scum games at all this season apart from the ones against us and them against Chelsea at the bridge. How they play and the mentality they play with remind me too much of Poch and it honestly hurts watching them. Pressing like animals, young players, beautiful passing combinations. Fucking hell we've lost our identity as a football club by hiring these dinosaurs.",Spurs,Yes,jazqylw,t1_jazgl54
Ours has changed to 'To dare is to make revenue',Spurs,Yes,jazzci6,t1_jazgl54
"I was also excited about him and to be fair I think he’s done some good things. You can tell that he’s a veteran player with lots of experience for sure. However that doesn’t really matter at this point. I dread to see him start and especially alongside Son. 

This system puts a lot of emphasis on wingbacks and I’m sure it can be effective but right now it’s not working. Yesterday both Perisic and Porro hugged the sideline for 90% of the game. Giving the ball to our wingbacks who run down their respective lanes and proceeds to try and get the ball into the box usually result in the following things: A defender clearing the ball away, the goalkeeper catching the ball or a corner kick. Very rarely does it ever lead to a goal and this tactic is just too predictable. 

What I like about Emerson is that he often goes into a more central position and help out in the midfield. I’ve noticed when we lose games our players are often very static and rigid in their position. But for the past 3 games that we won it was more dynamic with players covering more areas, Kane dropping deeper trying to help out, I don’t understand why they didn’t do this yesterday. I quite frankly don’t understand this system at all. How can it go from last season to this. It’s the same formation, mostly the same players yet vastly different results.",Spurs,Yes,jazm7cc,t1_jazi97w

"It's Sami Mokbep isn't it? He's been mikes off on loads of stuff lately. 

There is literally no way in hell we get Steve Cooper. Jes just signed a new contract tract too so he wouldn't even be that cheap to get.",Spurs,Yes,jb0kq0h,t1_jb0hj6e
Glasner mentioned in the same article too. Both are 3atb managers which might be a priority for the club considering the amount we’ve invested into wingbacks.,Spurs,Yes,jb0i7t1,t1_jb0hj6e
why not go back for Pochettino? WTF is wrong with us.,Spurs,Yes,jb0k7y7,t1_jb0hj6e

"I used to think that all Spurs were going to win was a few FA cups. Then Redknapp got us to the CL. Bale tearing Inter apart had me dreaming. Then there was Poch.

We are capable of these things and we will achieve those things one day.",Spurs,Yes,jb3j27z,t1_jb36eqy

"It’s a repeating cycle players look good under a manager initially for a time, then go back to being bad blame the manager, manager sacked.

"I agree, outside of the great strikers we've had at the club, we've always had great midfield players to watch as well, with Hoddle, Gazza, Anderton, Ginola, through to more recent players like Van de Vaart, Carrick, Modric, and Eriksen. Probably missed a ton out of that quick list.

That creativity made it feel like we could always unlock a defence and get a goal at any time and that is what made watching Spurs exciting for me.",Spurs,Yes,jb2fosy,t1_jb2biey
This season we haven’t even been good on the counter,Spurs,Yes,jb2la20,t1_jb2biey

"The amount of soft 50/50s they won against spineless defending and the fact every bounce went their way suggests an outlier performance.

Was the success criteria really that we should have won a trophy or challenging for the league title before the end of his first full season in charge?",Spurs,Yes,jb02lpc,t1_jb02azw
"Come to what point? What were your expectations for this season? The team isn't that good hence the inconsistency, if you thought we were going to challenge for the league title then you're deluded and getting to a cup final was wishful thinking at best.

Where we are is more or less where we supposed to be. This team should've got spanked by Leicester last season were it not for Bergwign and we lost to Wolves away last season too. 

The issue is the quality in the hence why we have consistency issue from game to game. I used to practice art and sometimes my drawings would be shit and sometimes they used to be good. The reason for that was because I wasn't very good and I hadn't mastered my ability/talent into skill it's the same situation here.",Spurs,Yes,jb03td3,t1_jb02azw

I’m not gonna argue that Conte has underperformed this season, although I think there are a multitude of mitigating factors for that. But I’m tired of this rinse and repeat thing we do with managers.

If he was really not that attached to Dortmund, I feel he would have left for a coaching position elsewhere after being switched over to another role to make way for Marco Rose.   


He is interesting though, and he definitely has cool ideas about football. I loved how well his side played the first half against Chelsea, moving really well in tight spaces.

"Mourinho almost won us a trophy. Conte did amazing last year and better than Jose ever did, but this year his football is almost worse than Jose's. Jose also got more out of Ndombele and Lo celso than Conte ever did. Conte has been given a much better squad but is playing bad football.

I think there is a legitimate debate over who was more ""successful"" with us. Either ways, its time to move on from both of them, but Mourinho was the one closer to winning us a trophy not Conte. Its time to bring in an attacking manager which neither of them are.",Spurs,Yes,jb0h0dm,t1_jazysxv

"Honestly I find Conte haters and Mourinho haters even more annoying than Conte and Mourinho fans. In fact, I'm still one of the few Jose and Conte fans left in r/coys.

With that said, I was Jose out after Zagreb and I am now Conte out. When something isn't working, it isn't working but that doesn't mean you have to hate two great managers. 

I'm ready to move on from both of them though. 

It must be said though that sacking Jose right before a cup final is absolutely insane and the worst decision this club has ever made. Ryan Mason? really?",Spurs,Yes,jb0ftxg,t1_jb07oey
I feel like we need to get the next ragnick. Football chaghes so quickly. It's amazing what he did at RB leipzing but I'm not sure that would necessarily work again for us,Spurs,Yes,jb17bkq,t1_jb16u1z

I wouldn't mind Richarlison asking to leave. It means we could sell him for a higher asking price than what we paid him for which would make it a good signing by Paratici. I think we could use the money at this rate.,Spurs,Yes,jb0go1e,t1_jb00c1h

Him or poch would be ideal choices but I think levy will go with poch.",Spurs,Yes,jb0ey02,t1_jb00rq8
Maybe a mix of all of them,Spurs,Yes,jb02dl2,t1_jb00ufd
"Levy has washed his hands with the footballing side of things.
Yeah, he can be criticized for taking too much of it during Pochs time here (part of that though was Poch being difficult with DOFs tbh) but since then, he has taken a step back, he has handed the footballing duties off to Paratici who has been building a new system behind the scenes since coming now.

Levy IMO can't be criticized for turning us into a commercial giant, the more the better IMO, it has no real impact on the pitch, other than bringing in more income for the managers to spend.

I personally think that what Levy can be blamed for is hiring Conte. I get why he did but it was the wrong choice for the club.
For example, I disagree with thinking that Paratici has had a middling bag, I think he has been great so far. The signings coming in overall have been of a high quality, minus Perisic but that's a Conte signing overall.

Richarlison could be amazing for us, not under conte though.
Danjuma could be a really useful squad player, once again, not under conte.
Bryan Gil I still think could excel but once again, not under Conte.",Spurs,Yes,jb0ghs7,t1_jb00ufd
"Don’t get the Paratici hate at all here. Those 3 objectively good signings are the best signings we’ve made in 8 seasons! And he’s only had 4 windows. Perisic (who I don’t think gets bought for any manager other than Conte) and maybe Forster and Gollini aside none of his signings who get minutes have caused any problems. It’s guys like Dier, Sanchez, Tanganga, Lloris etc who’ve caused us the problems this season. All bought in before Paratici arrived. Sure Bissouma, Richarlison etc have underwhelmed but the squad has far bigger problems. This sub has turned around on Paratici for no reason when as far as I can see the recruitment under him has been the best we’ve had since the Mitchell days.",Spurs,Yes,jb1fcfj,t1_jb00ufd
"I think City will win it, but I'm not 100% relaxed.",Spurs,Yes,jb0xp90,t1_jb0xcnq

"The reality is most managers, if not all managers, at the top levels are ""stubborn"" in their ways.

"I like Steve Cooper.

I don't find his Forrest team that interesting,Spurs,Yes,jb0b89z,t1_jb0alii
He said the only thing he loves more than Forest is his family so it’s clearly not going to happen.,Spurs,Yes,jb0d3wf,t1_jb0alii
"He’s nobody, so I would consider him as Nuno 2.0",Spurs,Yes,jb0i99j,t1_jb0alii

"I was speaking about the hierarchy of priorities in this club,  and i think the day to day existence as a PL football club *near the top* is about it for their wishes.

He clearly misses his family in Italy and with three recent bereavements in the last year, I think it's clear his head is not in the right place to be managing us. Throw in the frequent criticism of the transfer policy and I think it's very clear that us and him simply aren't a good fit. I don't think that's anyone's fault and it would cost the club to sack him, so I think most people are assuming things will just come to a natural conclusion at the end of the season.

Of course, if the results go really bad, he might well be sacked anyway.",Spurs,Yes,jb26obp,t1_jb24vui
gedson was a jose signing. poch wasnt at the club in january 2020,Spurs,Yes,jb06b2a,t1_jb04nym
Gedson was signed under Mourinho. Conte's been backed already an absolute ton & the team is getting worse.,Spurs,Yes,jb06aiv,t1_jb04nym
"My biggest concern is that after 18 months of almost exclusively playing 343 we have no consistency whatsoever. Backing Conte further is putting all our eggs in the 343 basket and I'm not at all convinced it's the right setup for us.

Having Kane but not playing a creative midfielder just doesn't sit well with me. I look at the top 3 with their Odegaards, de Bruynes, Bernardo Silvas, Fernandezes and Eriksens with petty jealousy. 

When they're on any sort of form we arguably have the best front 3 in the league but we're not getting the best out of them with our style of play and they're all suffering because of it. Funneling the majority of our attacks to the wings seems one-dimensional and largely ineffective in comparison. 

If it was up to me we'd go for a manager that plays a fluid 433 or 4213. I'm sick of playing on the back foot all the time - it's not what the best teams do and we should always aim to eventually be the best team - if not then what's the point of it all?",Spurs,Yes,jb0ctyh,t1_jb04nym

Also, there can be multiple people working on deals at a multibillion pound company. If spurs are getting money from F1 to go into the club, then in turn that money can be spent on the club and its players. This is really the most basic of economics, especially as ENIC reinvest the vast majority of our income.

Or we can not generate any money and you can spend every transfer window crying out your arse about how we don't spend anything? I'm sure that would be preferable for you given all I see from you is moaning.",Spurs,Yes,jaznpbq,t1_jazn5bz
"Mate.

There's 12 games left. Loads of football still to play. I'm not saying we will do it but to think it's over is ridiculous.",Spurs,Yes,jb1lbix,t1_jb1je8i
Just stop blaming ENIC for Contes failings. Conte didn't ask for a CBs he wanted WBs and got them.,Spurs,Yes,jb1l4v1,t1_jb1je8i
"Priority targets in the summer was a RWB and a CB. The club delivered Spence and Lenglet on a 6 month loan.

Conte was backed though, don't forget 😅",Spurs,Yes,jb1joeh,t1_jb1je8i
Agree unless we can overtake Man U somehow. I also agree on the CB situation. I do think that if Conte was given a legit CB he might play with a back 4 more and open things up offensively at least a bit. It comes down to whether you would accept the way Chelsea played as open enough when they won the title under Conte.,Spurs,Yes,jb1ploi,t1_jb1je8i
I think Tuchel is waiting on Madrid,Spurs,Yes,jb2461r,t1_jb1yjjl
Why the fuck would Tuchel ruin his reputation by joining us haha,Spurs,Yes,jb2g46r,t1_jb1yjjl
"I am here for this. If we make it past Milan and the team in the next round, we are legit contenders for CL by then. Then we can try to hire Tuchel and inshallah. I'm here for it. I'd wait and see though. Because even Milan aren't enough, if we draw Madrid, then we might as well already give up lol.",Spurs,Yes,jb20haz,t1_jb1yjjl

"Who are we kidding. Next manager is not going to get a full season by the reddit fanbase either. Once they crash out of a cup, or don't become league favourites immediately, they will call for the sack.

"Nah they'll turn on him as well.

"I have no love for Man Utd, but in what world are they, one of the most successful and richest clubs in history, ""a wannabe Man City""?

">This is the mad thing. We had 2 title runs, a load of semis and champs league final.

Long time floating reader here. I liked Pochs Spurs, v entertaining and direct. But the two title runs came when City and Liverpool were just transitioning into what they are now and Man u and Arsenal were floating under Moyes/LVG and Wenger. And you still lost it to Leicester. I'd say that's a negative more than a positive. 



>And poch did all this whilst barely spending. 

He spent €440,480,000 in 5 years as manager, that's 88m per season. That's roughly 5m less per year than Artetas current total spend at Arsenal, and he has already won an FA cup (might be more? Not sure ). But the Poch didn't spend thing isn't true",Spurs,Yes,jb0cm1o,t1_jb05aen
"We do have a lot of young energetic players. Richarlison Kulu bissouma bentancur porro udogie sarr skipp are all 25 and under. Its only kane son and hojberg...and tbh I think pehs fine at it now.

"The point is we need young energetic players regardless of the manager, be it Poch, de Zerbi, even in the case of Conte renewing. 

And I would say Romero is also a good presser and a dream for a manager who wants a high line, both Porro and Emerson are good pressers, Sarr and Skipp can be coached , thats also the best trait of Richarlison. I do agree about Kane, Son and Hojbjerg so this is I wont be surprised if Son becomes more of a bench player like Defoe soon and I also wont be surprised if Hojbjerg might be sold if Poch comes as in addition to him being slow, his lack of press resistance would also be something which Poch hates",Spurs,Yes,jb05bzp,t1_jb04pj8

"Which makes it feel all the more unlikely that we beat them, even when Spurs are looking good they still manage to pull something out or have something go their way. The last couple under Poch were also painful, remember that last minute own goal",Spurs,Yes,jb1d8jg,t1_jb1czj6

I disagree. We would never be close to the top 4 race under Potter. He might be doing better with us in terms of the football but even that football isn't great. I do think Potter would do a better job at developing our youth players but I really doubt that it would be worth it.,Spurs,Yes,jb0kdjz,t1_jb0iu3s

Those are fickle stats. We are where we are because of Kane and Son. Once they leave. It will be back to the old days. 

We have a window to win. And it's now. Most businesses when they have powerful assets take risks. Arsenal didn't have that. They still leveraged themselves and spent big. 

Do you think if we don't get the top 4? That f1 strategic money will help us? Will Levy spend as much as arsenal did? 

We're at the edge of getting overtaken by Newcastle. And next year. Chelsea will be back in the mix. So will Liverpool.

&#x200B;

>If spurs are getting money from F1 to go into the club, then in turn that money can be spent on the club

or we could focus on the field. Use the fact that we lucked into possibly the greatest striker in the premier league and the fact that he's in his prime. And that we have a limited window to win and winning always gets you more sponsors, more collaborators and more strategic partnerships.  

We had Kane and Son and we wasted away their best years. Son maybe is in Decline. If Kane hits that decline. We're fucked. How are you going to find a 20+ goal striker? 

&#x200B;

>Or we can not generate any money and you can spend every transfer window crying out your arse about how we don't spend anything?

Except that the money never gets spent or gets spent in horrible ways.  We have a window. We've signed one elite defender since 2015. An area we all know we need to spend on.  But we don't.  

And trust me if we miss out on the top 4 this season. They will not spend like Arsenal did. The poor manager whoever he is will be told to first get the top 4 and then maybe and maybe he gets some players.

>Losing to sheffield is not our level, and while I agree a lot of our players shouldnt be here (the defence) we should at least be scoring goals and we can't even do that. 

Sheffield United are a good championship team who'll probably get promoted to the Premier league next season they aren't crap they could give most teams a run for their money in the EPL. We had Richarlison, Lucas Moura and Son playing up front none of them are in good form.

 >Maybe you shoulf question the quality of the manager in the current circumstances.

We're on manager number 14 or 15 I don't remember which now but when are Spurs fans going to stop chasing their own tail by going after managers and start attacking the source of the problem the ownership? That's why I stopped attacking managers because we've gone through so many they all can't be horrible and tactically inept. 

>We didnt lose to Wolves away last szn we lost at home.

Your right I forgot 

>We should make progress when we are in regression.

But we aren't regressing this season we got off to the best start we've ever gotten off to in PL history I believe under Antonio Conte. This time last year we weren't fourth in the league and we had fewer points.

>Considering our values and our will for a long term project, we shouldnt have appointed Conte if he wasnt ready to commit

Look at how you're behaving after only a year of having Antonio Conte, I know for a fact many Spurs fans aren't ready for a long term project like they keep preaching about. Will you and many others be able to accept finishing 6th, 7th or 8th for countless seasons in a row paying these ticket prices?

"I'm not really sure we do need all that stuff. Very few teams other than city have that level of depth. I mean look at arsenal putting together a title run with an incredibly thin squad.
And realistically we aren't signing 8 quality players in one window, that'd be like £400m. Unless you kean for the rebuild in which case I agree!

In terms of nezt season i dont think we need a backup Rw desperately, that's what Richi is for. LB I think will be Udogie or Ben davies, Davies being a decent option if you play Porro at Rb and need a more defensive lb, could even see Regi being kept on under poch he's much better with a back 4. 

If poch came back I do wonder if he'd have another go at GLC as well tbh, although I hope not given his injuries.",Spurs,Yes,jazihev,t1_jazh8wh
"It was everything to do with the stadium why we didn't spend very much before then. 

That summer we spent €100m on sess ndombele and Jack Clarke. We also spent anywhere up to 20m on GLC loan fee as we tried to help them get around their sell on fee by doing an expensive loan fee and cheaper signing fee. 

So yeah that summer we spent €120m (and then another 30 in Jan on bergwijn)

Tbf on the lcb front our top targets didn't want to come and Lenglet was contes choice as a stand in supposedly. I'm sure if he'd said let's go for Pau torres instead we woukd have just done it.",Spurs,Yes,jb01lr4,t1_jb00hge
Yesterday wasnt too bad in isolation but the fact we just lost to sheff united the way we did its awful. The fact we lost 4-1 to leicester only a short amount of time ago.

I think the first step for Pochettino is prioritizing the carabao and FA Cups and even European Conference League (if it were ever that bad for us). We are desperate for trophies and I know Poch wanted us to be more ambitious but at this point even the small trophies matter.,Spurs,Yes,jb0krop,t1_jb0fu1d
Also very true!,Spurs,Yes,jb1bown,t1_jb1bjne
That's not the point. They spent it without having CL money. They didn't know if CL was a possibility. But they believed in the managers and spent it. Would Levy have spent that much without getting CL?,Spurs,Yes,jazra9g,t1_jazr39z

And as for the summer spending. I believe Pochs net spend was 19m a season. Which was actually less than when he was at saints.

"Better results?

By the end of it the one thing Conte will have is s top 4 finish, I’m not even a Mourinho fan but I’m just stating facts: he got us closer to a trophy than Conte ever will.",Spurs,Yes,jb029r4,t1_jb021f7
"No of course not, but they put a lot of trust in Arteta and backed his idea of football.

Hes off doing his job. Its not his job to be a fan.,Spurs,Yes,jazw6vl,t1_jazu0t7
"How many ""should definitely be a goal"" chances do you expect teams to make? 

Also, it becomes a bit of subjective gut feeling sort of thing to base a performance on then, doesnt it? At that point you being upset with Conte is going to mean you don't think the chances are good enough.",Spurs,Yes,jb01p23,t1_jazx578
">When City win the league again with probably their lowest points total in years.....Will that mean Arsenal hasn't had an impressive season? 

It's an odd comment because the season isn't over. You could argue Arsenal have fallen short if they lose but they would be losing to City under pep who's of the greatest managers in the world, and this is a transitional Arsenal team playing with second youngest team and manager (I think, I believe Bournemouth manager is a year younger) who aren't quite there yet from what I've seen. They wouldn't be losing their title to Leicester with a prime Kane, Deli, Erikson, Toby, Jan and son. So again, no it's not that impressive? 

>And as for the summer spending. I believe Pochs net spend was 19m a season. Which was actually less than when he was at saints. I'm not claiming he had to run it like a pauper but he punched well above his weight financially compare that to City Utd Arsenal Chelsea over that period and its crazy what he did.

Net spend means fuck all here. He still spent 400mil. He signed Tanguy, Sanchez, Aurier, Janssen, Lo Celso, Clarke, Foyth, Stamboli etc who all flopped massively and cost over 120mil 

As an expat living in France and supporting Toulouse, his tenure at PSG was entertaining for most French fans because they generally played meh but their team was insane. It was like watching Rodgers at Celtic, looked world class then average at Leicester. 

I don't think a manager has ever returned to a club at spurs level and succeeded have they? 

You'd be better going for someone new. 

I just don't like this statement that's always branded about that Poch didn't spend. Tanguy and Sanchez alone were 100mil.",Spurs,Yes,jb1xms3,t1_jb16y9k
"I'll take Pochettino especially if the other options are steve cooper and glasner... yuck. If you want 3ATB, go for Tuchel. But I'm done with it. Pochettino , De Zerbi, and Gallardo are the only choices that make sense.",Spurs,Yes,jb0vz8q,t1_jb0vhyy
"Yeah and Dier and Davies are very good friends with Kane, we should keep them at the club for the dressing room vibes🥰🥰🥰 

Also Tanganga is from the academy and Sess has a goofy smile, you’re a hater if you want the club to sell them!!!",Spurs,Yes,jb1fsdw,t1_jb1enup
"I’m sick and tired of these type of fans on here. Look at his response, just by not sucking of the team they consider you toxic, negative etc. 

When the fans don’t have standards, you can’t expect the club to have any either. There is no pressure, no expectations. A shit performance is forgotten after a day and then it’s back to normal. Not a single fanbase of an actual big club acts like this, we lack the cutthroat mentality when it comes to players and managers, people on here back shit players just because they like their character lmao",Spurs,Yes,jb1fdrt,t1_jb1e90j
"Sessegnon got a red, it happens? We also lost against Norwich and Antwerpen under Mourinho?",Spurs,Yes,jb0206r,t1_jb01wex

"Half their players are penguin herders And they didn't just lose, they got lambasted",Spurs,Yes,jb3vosl,t1_jb3nrw4
"Yes better results lmao. Conte's Spurs have a 1.87 ppg in the league... Mourinho's had 1.64 ppg. Even this season which is going so poorly... 1.73 ppg, comfortably above Mourinho. What about Champions League? Mourinho 0.75 ppg, Conte 1.57. FA Cup? Mourinho 4 wins 2 losses 2 draws, Conte 4 wins 2 losses. Mourinho didn't do shit, ""getting close to a trophy"" meant winning exactly as many matches in that competition as we did last season under Nuno/Conte (against tougher opposition)",Spurs,Yes,jb03dyx,t1_jb029r4
"I don't understand your point. You've got your facts wrong again. When spurs came 2nd under poch I think we had the youngest starting lineup in the league? So how is that any different to Arsenal now. The seasons would actually be remarkably similar I'm nit sure how you can possibly say that it woukd be an amazing achievement for Arsenal yet it wasn't When poch did it for spurs?

We literally at the time were saying what you are saying about Arsenal ""we are a young team"" etc etc. Kane dele eriksen etc weren't prime they were all like 22/23? 

I really think you need to do some research on this because that's twice you've been glaringly wrong now. You've made a weird statement and then completely messed up your facts about it. 

Why does net spend mean fuck all? I dont understand. And I still don't understand your point on this either? We didn't sign any players for 18 months because we were putting money into the new stadium. And even then.....uts still significantly lower than the teams around us spent during that time, Arsenal included. And on top of all that you were comparing it to Arteta for some reason and then we established arteta has spent as much in half the time?

What are you talking about?",Spurs,Yes,jb239gb,t1_jb1xms3
"His response is perfectly reasonable. Honestly, I don't think you understand what it means to support a football club

You think there's no pressure?? Spurs fans boo the team off an embarrassing amount. Especially in recent seasons.

Your idea of what a football fan is is not just moronic, it's tiresome. It just disregards what football is for so many match going fans. 

Huntergaming is a thousand times the yid you'll ever be if you want to boo rather than cheer when things, really, aren't that bad.",Spurs,Yes,jb1g9ui,t1_jb1fdrt
"Also lost against Middlesbrough, Notts Forest and Sheffield with Conte?

So why is he getting a pass?",Spurs,Yes,jb02452,t1_jb0206r
He's getting a pass cause he got top 4 while making the whole team look really good last year. Why should Mourinho get a pass?,Spurs,Yes,jb028r9,t1_jb02452
"Mourinho isn’t getting a pass, he was dog. But the fact you’re happy with shit football and shit attitude from our current manager on the grounds of a top 4 finish says a lot. Especially when you’re trying to use predecessor performances to justify it.

I mean ffs Leicester sacked Ranieri the season after they won the league. At least they’ve won a FA Cup since then too. Yet you lot are happy to limp on celebrating balance sheets and a top 4 finish, pathetic.",Spurs,Yes,jb02jjm,t1_jb028r9
"For someone who isn't getting a pass, you sure do like to defend him a lot. I am not happy with Conte, but I prefer to have him in the long as long as Kane is here. I am tired of sacking managers",Spurs,Yes,jb02sbt,t1_jb02jjm
"Funny how an objective comparison is interpreted as defending Mourinho, wonder why that is.",Spurs,Yes,jb02uf0,t1_jb02sbt

Taking Emerson as an example we've seen the fanbase hit some real lows in the way they've treated him, if he was backed sooner maybe we would have seen him come good quicker too, maybe we wouldn't. If you blow that up to the grander scale we see so much vitriol towards other members of the team, the board, a go-kart track, player/manager of the month awards, the manager and their staff. It reminds me a lot of Arsenal 2 or 3 years ago when their fanbase seemed like one of the most toxic going. I'm not saying gooners are saints or there aren't other teams we can draw comparison to, but you see how they get behind the team throughout games, even when losing.

If we beat Milan and make it to the next round I'll be happy. The champions league song is still amazing and I'm glad we are still in it. I would love to keep being in it because we haven't been in it before this season for like 4 years. I am grateful with that. 

(With that said, the fact that my expectations are this low for a team that has Kane, Son, and are apparently ""a top 6 club"" is just shameful). 

Please beat Milan though, that would bring me joy. :(",Spurs,No,jardwwo,t3_11gt10s
"Tomorrow’s game is against Wolves is 3pm kick-off. Over the next 2 months we are getting absolutely screwed by the 3pm kick-offs

If we get knocked out by Milan on Tuesday then there will be no Spurs on the tele in the UK for 46 days apart from Everton on a Monday in the middle of it. That’s rough. I understand why they do it but I’ve always wondered why can’t they play the Premier League games earlier/later on a Saturday so that fans that watch Lower League teams can watch both? 

On a similar note, I’ve seen that Peacock in the USA costs a fiver per month. Is it worth getting a VPN and trying to get a free trial/just pay the tenner for the next 2 months? Or should I study for exams?",Spurs,No,jas4af8,t3_11gt10s

"Ok I know this talk is sensitive with the fans, but here are the list of players that I think we should really attempt to sell this summer. (like we should be doing everything we can to get any money back):

Eric Dier (he won't be worth much but we gotta try)

Davinson Sanchez (should have been sold years ago, bad Hitchens signing)

Lucas Moura (probably leaving on a free hopefully)

Japhet Tanganga (I always liked him but it isn't working)

Ryan Sessegnon (I'm sorry but he has gotta go, we've seen enough, horrible Hitchens signing)

Sergio Reguilon (this one upsets me the most because he was capable of being so good but it isn't working out for him. He is also struggling at Atletico right now and is injury prone)

Hugo Lloris (I appreciate all that he has done for the club, but it is definitely time to go).

Ivan Perisic (He is old and if Conte leaves it makes no sense to keep him anymore tbh).

Harry Winks (doing well in Serie A, happy for him, I think it might suit him better than the PL's physicality and pace would)

Ndombele: (I get he is talented, but he isn't suited to the premier league. Honestly Ndombele is showing us that he isn't even suited to the italian league. Ndombele really makes the most sense in a league like Ligue 1 and thats where we should try to sell him).

Lo Celso: (Very interesting utility player, but I just don't think it is going to work out). He isn't that great at being a CAM. Not what we need right now. Makes more sense as a winger or striker than as a CAM and we don't need that right now. Should be trying to sell.",Spurs,No,jarhufs,t3_11gt10s
"Ok I'll try to be positive: I actually like how our youth (25 or under) is looking. 

Pedro Porro: Very overpriced, but I still remember how great he looked at sporting. I still am positive on him despite struggling defensively.

Djed Spence: Whether as a winger or as a wingback, Djed definitely has the talent to be good. He is like an Ndombele but I think the difference is Djed isn't lazy he just has some overconfidence/lack of concentration he needs to work on. 

Kulusevski: I don't care that he is struggling right now, we have a player in Kulu. I have no doubt he will be back in form under a new system. 

Skipp: Hasn't been world class yet, but he has shown me very encouraging signs as a DM/CM. Is already just as good as Mason Mount if not better imo. 

Bentancur: An amazing CM.Was arguably our best player earlier in the season besides Harry Kane. Great signing.

Pape Matar Sarr: I have really high hopes for him. I have been very impressed whenever he has played. I know I'm jumping the gun here but the potential is really high with this kid. (I think this guy has what it takes to be as good as Yaya toure, gerrard, or lampard). Obviously he isn't good enough yet.

Cristian Romero: I still believe he is the next Sergio Ramos. I really rate him. I hope he proves me right. 

Even players like Richarlison and Emerson have shown flashes of being good players. I still think they could turn out to be good unlike players like (Sanchez and Sessegnon)

For an upcoming Project manager, there are pieces to work with here. We just have to find the right manager. IMO: those two guys are De Zerbi or Marcelo Gallardo, but hopefully we hire the right one. 

I do think the future is brighter than the present (even in a world where Kane and Son leaves). COYS!",Spurs,No,jarjrcb,t3_11gt10s
"I really don’t get why you lot keep getting your hopes up every year about our summer transfers. Every transfer window people come on here calling it a 7-8/10. Look at the hype this sub had for the summer. We brought in 6 players(plus Udogie who remained at Udinese) and none of them have been an upgrade in the starting XI. And a good amount of our staring XI was/is subpar to begin with, it’s not like we’re fielding the Galacticos every week. We don’t spend enough and when we do so much of it goes to waste. 

How people still think a top 4 finish is the most important thing for us is beyond me at this point. We just got lucky with Son and Kane carrying us for the past 5-6 seasons, every other serious team would start building around them after being gifted to world class players for basically nothing, our owners saw it as a reason to actually hold off on spending.",Spurs,No,jaqhvut,t3_11gt10s
"Given our CB and FWD situations are a bit of a mess right now, I’d like us to build from our strong areas tactically next season: our midfielders (Peh, ben10, skipp, bissouma, Sarr) and our attacking wingbacks (Udogie, Porro).        
The only formation where we can maximise them is the 352.       
Good thing that it suits both Son and Richarlison better too without the defensive burden they have to take in the current 343.      
Unfortunately it means four of them will have to rotate for the front two spots but a silver lining to it is that we don’t need to sign another fwd and can focus on signing new CBs.       
Now the bad news is that even after signing 2 new CBs, we would just have 4 usable CBs when we need 3 at all times leaving us short of depth. Expecting us to sign three CBs is just impossible with this ownership.   

Here the tactical tweak I propose is to use Emerson as RCB backup in addition to RWB. If Davies can do it, so can he. Bring back Spence for additional cover.     
The lineup would looks something like this:     


||Kane/Son||Deki/Richy||

Lets say this if you had to choose between either (Kane and having a manager like Tuchel or keeping Conte) OR choosing to sell Kane and bringing Poch back or bringing Gallardo in to completely rebuild the squad. WHICH choice are you choosing. For me, I'd rather just rebuild.

"Pretty much agree with you. 'Never go back to an ex' is a good adage in life and in football. Pochettino was fantastic for a certain time and with a specific type of player, namely young, hungry, inexperienced. Ones that won't put up a fuss when the boss orders them to do double training sessions, or hare down the defence in hunt of the ball. That's not the squad we have now. Kane isn't the athlete he was at 22, and asking him to press like a madman would not only be a waste of his remaining years but could potentially cause him to injure himself again. We don't have anything close to a Dembele to progress the ball. Our centre backs aren't a shadow on Jan & Toby. There are simply too many reasons why it wouldn't work and Poch has shown very little since 2018 that suggests he knows how to adapt his style of play to suit a different squad.",Spurs,Yes,jaqb4zm,t1_jaqaf8y
With our current squad it’s not a good idea at all. Fans wanting him back are looking at it through rose tinted glasses. Only way I could see a logic for him coming back is if we have a total rebuild and the board are probably against that and I don’t see that happening,Spurs,Yes,jaqasw0,t1_jaqaf8y

"Genuinely love when when a comment ends with “thoughts?” I just think it’s so funny. BUT it seems people are either leaning way into Poch coming back or way against Poch coming back. I’m personally still hoping Conte sticks around and gets his defense. 

But if he doesn’t, I don’t have any problem with Poch coming back into the fold. We know exactly what we’re getting with him. Attacking football where the players run their asses off. Which sounds great to me. It might take a year for him to implement his style tho so we would still need patience with him. 

On the other hand taking a punt on someone like Marcelo Gallardo could be a fun experiment with Ultra attacking football. The chance to fall in love with another manager and his team sounds great. I would imagine that would take a few extra years. 

So if Conte leaves I think offering Poch a 3 year contract would be great. If we go in another direction like Gallardo who is only proven in 1 minor league, give him a 5 year and let’s see what he can do. 

Thoughts?",Spurs,Yes,jaqcp3m,t1_jaqaf8y
"Because we had no squad reset. It’s pretty simple - Poch’s methods are such that every 4-5 years we need a refresh, very much in line with SAF’s policy

Over the course of the 16/17, 17/18 and 18/19 windows we only made 2 good signings in Wanyama and Sanchez(good under Poch and would’ve developed him)

If our transfers are so bad that only after a 4 year cycle you start a rebuild then we’d fail every single time. No the rebuild starts one year into the cycle. Challenged for the title in 15/16 and proceeded to buy only 2 good players over the course of the next 3 years. That’s what fucked us up

But Poch is that good of a manager he somehow managed to keep us competitive irrespective of our transfer failings

So yeah, Poch isn’t that one that has to change, it’s us. Conte isn’t the one that has to change, it’s us. It’s very very rarely the manager’s fault and in our case it definitely isn’t, our recruitment has just been shite",Spurs,Yes,jaqh1p4,t1_jaqaf8y
"I'd rather have Pochettino over Conte right now, but I prefer Marcelo Gallardo, De Zerbi (i really rate him) and even Tuchel (yes Mr. ""back 3 tuchel"") over him. 

I also don't think Kane would stay under Poch.",Spurs,Yes,jarepdl,t1_jaqaf8y
"The usual suspects have been given access to the internet by their parents again so are on here spouting their incoherent ENIC Out posts.

Strange that you never see their names on here following a win, but hey, who am I to judge.",Spurs,Yes,jaqufhf,t1_jaqtkvx
I think many of us have finally snapped thankfully and are starting to wake up to the reality this club finds itself in. Hopefully this frustration won’t just be forgotten should we beat Wolves tomorrow.,Spurs,Yes,jaqtrxo,t1_jaqtkvx
Good. I love the idea of their idiot fanbase preventing their club from buying a striker who would instantly turn them into title contenders and relegate us to midtable.,Spurs,Yes,jatai9d,t1_jareyel
"As boring as this team might be sometimes, I wouldn’t want to miss a single game.",Spurs,Yes,jaqgegs,t1_jaqf9wa
"Yeah of course, even if the football is dreadful and I can't help but get jealous of other teams, I still can't shake my connection to the club",Spurs,Yes,jaqmth0,t1_jaqf9wa
No because what if I miss one of the times we're actually having a good performance.,Spurs,Yes,jaqhr0o,t1_jaqf9wa
"Bloody hell you can tell its only been 10 years!

You should have seen some of the shite we were served up under Alan Sugar. Spurs were basically like Palace up until 2010",Spurs,Yes,jaqhhs5,t1_jaqf9wa
I have been going for 20 years almost and I sell half of my tickets this season.  Just bored shitless with it.,Spurs,Yes,jaqqa5t,t1_jaqf9wa
I dont want to watch but ik i will,Spurs,Yes,jaqgyx6,t1_jaqf9wa
I really only make an effort when it’s an important game like a European fixture or a big game in the league. Otherwise I only watch if I am home without Uni work because I work alternating Saturdays and Sundays so I often miss a few games every season by nature.,Spurs,Yes,jaqfg7r,t1_jaqf9wa
i wanna watch every other game. feels like we alternate from great performance to shitting the bed,Spurs,Yes,jaqg1dh,t1_jaqf9wa
Yeah same. Used to watch every game without exception. Now I don’t really care at all.,Spurs,Yes,jaqg9bh,t1_jaqf9wa
"Responded, I can sympathise with you with how difficult it can be to get responses for a diss questionnaire (mine was also football related). 

I have a slight criticism of your questionnaire, some of the questions allow for only one answer, where in my opinion they could be multiple choice as several answers are relevant. Your call obviously, but it might give you something to write about in the limitations section at the end of your diss - examiners and supervisors love seeing an objective look at limitations of the study",Spurs,Yes,jar6s63,t1_jar5d86
Arsenal are probably salivating over the prospect of signing him now that he’s a rapist,Spurs,Yes,jaqtfjy,t1_jaqqj6n
Does that make Emerson the best RWB in the world now?,Spurs,Yes,jaqvii4,t1_jaqqj6n
Don’t think we were ever seriously in for him were we?,Spurs,Yes,jas1qzc,t1_jaqqj6n
"Next year it'll be Udogie, Son, new CB. I doubt Lenglet is signed permanently and Perisic will be on the final year of his contract, though I wouldn't be surprised if we move on from he and Reguilon in the summer.",Spurs,Yes,jasi6gv,t1_jas6gbx
"This happens everytime a manager is sacked lmao. Probably in some Athletic piece titled “Stubbornness, Politics, and Personal Tragedy - How it All Fell Apart for Antonio Conte at Tottenham” or something. Then Ali will talk about how the players are all “really impressed with training” and the new “tactical genius” assistant manager when new boss comes in. Rinse and repeat.",Spurs,Yes,jas2yc1,t1_jas0oo2
"I remember the leaks about Poch being “big brother” towards the end and also about how Jose did no attacking training whatsoever.

I’m fairly certain those were either Winks or Rose, whoever it was, I doubt they’re still at the club.",Spurs,Yes,jas3ti8,t1_jas0oo2
we already had that about a month ago,Spurs,Yes,jas1525,t1_jas0oo2
"I used to want top 4 over a cup because I was neive enough to believe the increased status and revenue would be reinvested into the club to take the squad to the next level.

Not increase the share price while on the pitch performances suffered.",Spurs,Yes,jaq9mjp,t1_jaq9cij
It’s shocking. People want a nicer looking balance sheet over winning the best cup competition in the world. Clearly aren’t that invested in the club.,Spurs,Yes,jaqcog1,t1_jaq9cij
"It's crazy that it's even a consideration. Arsenal and United both missed out on top 4, yet one is probably going to win the league, one already won the Carabao cup and has a good shot at the FA cup, and they both can win the Europa league. The only way their seasons don't end miles better than ours is if we somehow win the CL, which is not realistically gonna happen. 

4th place should not be a target for any ""big 6"" team. Conte is a win-now manager and got targets in pretty much every position he asked for, so he should've targeted a top 3 finish to at least improve on last season and a cup competition. Even if we didn't win the league cup or FA cup, we should've at least gone out against bigger teams, not Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United's B-teams. It's such a joke, if we lose on Wednesday the season is pretty much over",Spurs,Yes,jaqd061,t1_jaq9cij
"But but but....

The world class Training centre and stadium. Being self sufficient and not doing a Leeds/Portsmouth/insert team here. One of the highest ticket prices in the world. Tottenham DNA etc.",Spurs,Yes,jaqafhn,t1_jaq9cij
"American and I would take an FA cup and finishing 12th over the top 4. I want a fucking Trophy. We need to always prioritize cups, as it’s our best/ only chance at winning something, but top 4 and the payday that comes with it is ENIC’s trophy.",Spurs,Yes,jaqets6,t1_jaq9cij
No one in their right mind would rather 2nd-4th over 5th and some silverware.,Spurs,Yes,jaqcy36,t1_jaq9cij
"We've been occupied by these ""Business of Football"" yanks. Who jack off to the revenue generated and the financial balance sheet. They don't remember 2008. Because they weren't there for it. So of course they don't think a cup is important",Spurs,Yes,jaqfgfz,t1_jaq9cij
"I hope people are finally realizing how crazy that is. Yes, even the fucking Carabao Cup is worth more than Top 4 finish will ever be. You see it with Arsenal, they finished 5th and they are on their way to winning the fucking league. No one will remember Kane and Son for finishing top 4, they will remember them for not winning trophies. Period, trophies matter.

""Champions League pull"" is overrated anyways. Perisic and Richarlison have not proven to be good signings. Arsenal got Zinchenko and Jesus ffs. 

We are getting owned by this.",Spurs,Yes,jarg0uh,t1_jaq9cij
Lost my shit when we got booted off the EFL Cup. That was equally as winnable if not for Manu demolishing everything we couldve stopped them as we always play to our level,Spurs,Yes,jaqfuof,t1_jaq9cij
I feel like the Milan game is the saving grace of the season. Win it and go through and we've got something to look forward to.,Spurs,Yes,jasg0i3,t1_jardwwo
"Glad I pay a fucking fortune every month for Sky, BT and Prime so I can sit there watching a shitty illegal stream. 

It's a joke. I can watch every single game from Italy, Germany, France but not the one I live in.",Spurs,Yes,jas6kks,t1_jas4af8
Sort out an IPTV. That's the only way to watch football in the modern age,Spurs,Yes,jas6zom,t1_jas4af8
">On a similar note, I’ve seen that Peacock in the USA costs a fiver per month. Is it worth getting a VPN and trying to get a free trial/just pay the tenner for the next 2 months? Or should I study for exams?

this is what i did. peacock with VPN costs me about a tenner per month. well worth it",Spurs,Yes,jasyalz,t1_jas4af8
"Peacock has the games but the commentary is abysmal (imbecile Lee Dixon, bland Graham Le Saux, City/Utd/Liverpool/Chelsea cocksucker Peter Drury); better to watch it in Spanish.",Spurs,Yes,jas4tw8,t1_jas4af8
"""Money is the ultimate trophy"" levy probably",Spurs,Yes,jasc5s2,t1_jars0pu
"If that's for sure their logic and aim, I don't get it. Would the club winning trophies not indirectly improve financials through brand exposure and merch sales?",Spurs,Yes,jark18z,t1_jari8y5
"You are finally speaking the gospel my friend. ENIC only NEED top 4 for the money and stadium. They don't care about trophies. So it makes sense that Levy wants us to be ""successful"" in the sense of top 4.",Spurs,Yes,jarigri,t1_jari8y5
The way people praise levy for his “financial responsibility” you would think they are named in his will. This year our Revenue matched Chelsea. Shit is embarrassing,Spurs,Yes,jaqh508,t1_jaqg2g6
I don’t know what up in arms is supposed to mean here. Most people on this sub are pretty miserable with the Sheffield defeat and still ranting about it we just can’t agree whether it’s Conte or ENIC’s fault. Ultimately whichever of the 2 it is there’s not much we can do about it. Do you have an idea for how to protest it or even who/what to protest about? Otherwise I can’t see how else we could get up in arms,Spurs,Yes,jas0abb,t1_jaqg2g6
Rodon?,Spurs,Yes,jarsu60,t1_jarhufs
"Ndombele, lol celso, and winks also",Spurs,Yes,jark7ga,t1_jarhufs
"I really doubt we try and sell Dier. Perisic won't have any takers at his age and form. The rest yeah obviously, I think Reggie could still make it but it's probably more likely we try and sell, he's barely played this year though so might not be possible",Spurs,Yes,jasfwhq,t1_jarhufs
"Some people haven’t endured long summers where nobody we want to sell have any actual buyers, and it shows. FIFA Career Mode mindset",Spurs,Yes,jaue8x4,t1_jarhufs
"Udogie?

Will leave Sess out.",Spurs,Yes,jarscga,t1_jarjrcb
"Do agree with your main ideas because when healthy, our team has many exciting young players. Really do think we need to upgrade massively at CB. 

Also, a very attack minded center midfielder. A new 'Eriksen'. I like Maddison but I think he'll either be too expensive relative to his age (and how many years he can really play at a top level).",Spurs,Yes,jatb93y,t1_jarjrcb
"That can come down to a coaching problem, they have hardly been integrated into the squad. granted some have been injured for majority of their time here.

Bissouma was regarding as one of the best midfielders in the PL has started only 8 games. 

Richarlison was scoring 1 in 3 for Everton has started only 7 games. 

You could argue they have hardly been given a chance fully for multiple reasons.",Spurs,Yes,jaqltn1,t1_jaqhvut
Complete bollocks.  Show me when we haven't been spending in the last 5 years aside from when the manager refused every option?  We make a loss after transfers after factored in so how do you propose we fund more spending than we have now?,Spurs,Yes,jaqq4z0,t1_jaqhvut
"True, but also look at Arsenal. We should be ashamed our rivals are about to go win the league, without any gigantic transfers, or insane spending. We don't need to try be like Chelsea or Madrid to win the league.",Spurs,Yes,jaqmo1p,t1_jaqhvut
Lol so true.,Spurs,Yes,jaqjfdl,t1_jaqhvut
"Because transfer windows are all about naive hope my friend. Hope is a drug for football fans and of course new players who we haven’t seen be shit yet are gonna look amazing compared to current players we see be shit week in week out. None of us are analysts or scouts it’s not our job to know whether a player is actually good before they arrive just to get our hopes up only for them to be completely dashed. 

The irony is that the one good transfer window we’ve had in 6 seasons (last January) most fans thought was rubbish at the time as it looked like we’d just panic bought 2 Juve rejects while thinning our depth for the run in. 

No doubt our recruitment has been terrible the last few years but you can’t blame the fans for having hope. Us being miserable or skeptical about new players ain’t gonna make ENIC any better at recruitment",Spurs,Yes,jarznqd,t1_jaqhvut
">Here the tactical tweak I propose is to use Emerson as RCB backup in addition to RWB. If Davies can do it, so can he

That is so absurd. Davies has played outside the CB role before in his early days here and for Swansea. Emerson in his professional career has never played at RCB so if you think it's bread and butter that's not going to happen anytime soon. Also being a CB requires not just excellent tackling but also good decisions and reading of the game and composure on the ball. Look at Tanganga, he can definitely put his foot in and work as a Defensive RB , but he's good piss poor decision making and awareness and thus he makes for a bad CB.",Spurs,Yes,jaurf20,t1_jarxl7e
In a word? No. Longer answer is he's 31 we won't be able to replicate his usefulness that pool had with him as a false 9 and we've got richarlison as a second striker who already doesn't get minutes why sign another forward to take up a squad slot who won't get minutes,Spurs,Yes,jar7lbw,t1_jar4yfo
"if we didn't have Richarlison maybe, but I don't think it makes sense anymore. We legit need CBS and a CAM. 

Everything else on our squad is good enough for now.",Spurs,Yes,jarc0tl,t1_jar4yfo
"Genuinely not bothered about them in any shape or form until they sign a striker lol

No point in having so many players who all play the exact same position",Spurs,Yes,jatwqtx,t1_jatnc1r
We HAVE to beat Milan now. If we don't there will be total meltdown.,Spurs,Yes,jaqo7fw,t1_jaqmhp9
"
>im not a fucking accountant

"People act as if we’re Everton with their FFP problems the way they go on about finances. Look at the amount clubs like Spammers, Forrest, Fullham we’re spending last summer. For a club like ours money real isn’t a issue, we generate more than enough even without CL qualification. We could finish in the EL and spending 120-150m would be doable. People on here trying to make out Daniel Levy being Oliver Twist, it’s so stupid.",Spurs,Yes,jaqczmy,t1_jaqcc4l
"exactly, they act like they are inheriting Lewis's money. Let the old man spend the money. Why are we being precious about his wealth",Spurs,Yes,jaqdukl,t1_jaqcc4l
"Perisic hasn't been playing well at all, I think the ""Perisic makes Son bad"" crowd are dumb, but Perisic has not been good all season.

His defensive frailty has been the reason for a lot of conceded goals this season, and he hasn't been good enough in open play offense to justify that.

To be honest, Davies has been the best LWB I've seen besides when Doherty was in proper form pre-injury and was playing out there.",Spurs,Yes,jaqloxs,t1_jaqkmlt
"Or its because Perisic just hasn't been good.

With Son on the pitch, or off it, Perisic plays the same way and has been awful. He is in the bottom 1% of players in the PL for through balls or progressive passing.

He doesn't contribute to the defence, he doesn't track back and gets caught out all the time.

&#x200B;

You'd have a point if the player that hadn't got the most abuse this year by fans so far hadn't been Sonny himself lol",Spurs,Yes,jaqkskz,t1_jaqkmlt
"Or get this, maybe Perisic isn’t good enough and is getting flak regardless. Sons terrible performance isn’t an exclusive fault of Perisic. It’s just Perisic is not good enough.",Spurs,Yes,jaqkqnt,t1_jaqkmlt
"What's funny to me is that we could easily claim that Perisic is playing shit because of Son. It's such a simplistic argument. People say well last season Perisic wasn't here and Son won the golden boot. Well last season Perisic didn't have to play with Son and he was statistically the best LWB in Europe.

I don't think its one or the other tbh but it's just a stupid argument.",Spurs,Yes,jaqlb95,t1_jaqkmlt
You Gen Z guys are crazy,Spurs,Yes,jaqlg9a,t1_jaqkmlt
"It definitely contributes to the criticism he receives, but tbh he deserves most of it. His performances have really dropped off since the World Cup, but I don’t even blame him. Having a 34 year old moving to one of the toughest leagues and play so many games plus going all the way in the WC, is down to our recruitment. Going into a season with the arguably most important position in Contes system with a veteran and Sess who is constantly injured and apart from a few performances has shown time and time again he’s not at the required level was suicide.",Spurs,Yes,jaqlobs,t1_jaqkmlt
"Didn’t Nathan from TEI put out a video yesterday about this? The conclusion was the difference is marginal.

Maybe Son has just been in bad form this season? There have been so many individual battles, chances and decisions this season Son has fluffed without any external influence from Perisic’s presence on the pitch, he just looks devoid of confidence and tbh I think he should’ve been benched way earlier rather than attempting to play him out of form which has just had the opposite effect by all accounts. He’s looked so much more dangerous coming off the bench.

Perisic as of late hasn’t been that good himself but that’s a completely separate discussion.",Spurs,Yes,jaqlx3n,t1_jaqkmlt

I will say in your defense there seems to be a large representation of levy supporters on here for sure I don't know whether it's most of the subs on here though. Anyone that attempts to push against the board or the ownership is usually downvoted in some way. This board also makes a concerted effort to push published content that is heavily skewed to paint the ownership in a good light. Whereas any content that is pushed the other way is usually downvoted or brigaded on mass.,Spurs,Yes,jat9msm,t1_jasv9c7
"Its my opinion but, as long as Levy didn't step into the football decision, He's actually good. I don't wanna an owner like Todd, who spent shit mindlessly, can't always living to support a club with an ecstasy--a short living good times. The current football situation where's the owner are a literal country, the urge to ask the club to spend more money will of course rising.

I would say things like, if City without the Emirati, and keeping their current business model will they still relevant and be sustainable? Most of their sponsor would be gone, since its fake dodgy sponsor that the country owns them, they will actually needed a new business model as soon as the Emir gone. The wages, their fans expectation (that will always high with the money they've spend), their standard, etc. They're more tied to their owner than they even realized. I  think they're not even owns their stadium so not much other choices to makes money unless they did great on the pitch... but they can't even win the UCL, so doubt they will have a long age after the Emir gone.

But if Spurs without Levy and keeping our current business model, are we still gonna be relevant? I believe we are. ENIC doesn't tied us like most of club owners, Levy seriously building a club with the power to sustain themself even if he gone. So I don't mind even if Levy still here.",Spurs,Yes,jaszdva,t1_jasv9c7

There are so many people whose entire profile on social media is just ""ENIC Out"" shit, you know nothing about them and their opinions besides that they hate the ownership. I think if ""ENIC Out"" were less divisive, annoying, and arrogant, they would do much better - if they actually found out pain points people have for the ownership - they could then focus their campaigning on those areas.

However, what actually happens is they have 1 tactic, spam the same 6 shitty ""memes"" and images they've made under every bit of Tottenham news, and if you disagree with them they call you a Levy cocksucker or something and don't engage with you. Then they wonder why communities like /r/coys pop up, where lots of people who don't agree with them, try to keep the place free of ENIC-Out shit, because everywhere else is full of it from a loud minority.",Spurs,Yes,jatd860,t1_jasv9c7

"I thinking saying we NEED a rebuild is extreme. Our midfield is strong going forward. Bentancur, Skipp, Sarr. 
Emerson looks great and if he keeps form is a great option at RWB or potentially RB. Porro has promise. Spence, Romero, Kane. (if he stays, which we should want)
We lack depth, and lack CB’s. A cup match and we bring on Sanchez? That is dreadful. 
I think we are closer to breaking through to cup competition than we are being a mid table club. That may be optimistic but saying we need a rebuild is dramatic.",Spurs,Yes,jashlyi,t1_jarceu6

"Yeah I agree with you, I don't think it should be sunshine and rainbows, the club have fallen short of expectations. I think what I'm getting at is maybe something to do with the psychological side of being a fan and the impact it can directly or indirectly have on a sports team and at what point could it turn from what it is now into something that offers up much more. Emerson dug himself out and I'd like to think we wouldn't explode on him if he put a couple of 5/10 performances in but maybe that's naive.

"I think this is overstated, all teams struggle to break down good low block teams. We put 2 past west ham and they have one of the best defensive records in the league. Southampton played like a 5-4-1 on the first day of the system and we pumped them. Newcastle beat us, but we still managed to put one past them, and besides the foul of Lloris it really should have ended a tie. They have by far the best defence in the league, and it was actually broken by the much-maligned Lenglet. The guy is really good at crossing from deep in the half-space, we've got a few goals off that.

I could go on, but generally this season low blocks haven't been our problem. Our problem has been individual errors ruining our good efforts elsewhere. We need more confidence in our backline, and better players in there, asap.",Spurs,Yes,jaqyo5s,t1_jaqwf0d

"Winning a League Cup or FA Cup at the expense of Top 4 costs us something like 40m. That's a CB, that's a GK, that's a CAM...the sad reality that Spurs fans don't seem to want to accept is that this side is not of the quality to win a trophy. You don't get there without continually qualifying for the CL and getting the resources to bolster your squad. People ask why we keep playing the same XI and not rotating, then we rotate heavily and get embarrassed. We are in the long-overdue rebuilding period. Top 4 this season (and probably next season) is more than sufficient for this squad while we rotate out the bad eggs and get in better players. The rebuild is stalled if we don't qualify for the CL.",Spurs,Yes,jarhgvn,t1_jaraext

"And how come almost none of these players are at the club anymore? They keep spending on quantity over quality, buying young players for 10-20m trying to increase their value. Sarr, Gil, Sess, Udogie,Spence, Rodon etc. making us look like a shit Dortmund because it hasn’t worked once apart from us breaking even on Bergwijn. We have had about 3 “big” transfers in the past 4 years, two of which came of the back of that huge sum accumulated through our 2018/19 CL run. Other than that this club is allergic of spending over 25m on a player. Serious clubs are consistently spending 40-60m on seasoned players in their prime (26-28 yo), something you won’t see under this ownership I promise you.

We had the best chance last summer to finally take the next step, yet what do we do? Get to veterans in the twilight of their career on a free, get one CB in on a dry loan who has been a meme for about 2 years, 2 youngsters for small sums (Spence, Udogie), a decent player for 23m who was in the last year of his contract and one actual big money signing, who plays in the two positions we actually have WC players in. What a shit window and shot money spent.",Spurs,Yes,jaqszj6,t1_jaqq4z0
"It's not that absurd. He is a defensive fullback similar to Davies. Worth an experiment imo. If it fails it fails, we are not going to sign a RCB too for Romero backup if we're already looking to sign a LCB and a CCB anyway.",Spurs,Yes,jauvmc7,t1_jaurf20
Not bothered until they get a new manager,Spurs,Yes,jauo5ig,t1_jatwqtx
">Look at the amount clubs like Spammers, Forrest, Fullham we’re spending last summer

Yeah and look at QPR, Sunderland, Leeds 10-12 years ago that did the same thing, they spent far above their means, just like the 3 teams you've mentioned.

They failed to break into the 'big time' and their teams all collapsed under the weight of their expenditures and ended up in League 1 because of it.

&#x200B;

WHam probably dont have that issue because begrudgingly they're a big enough team with enough of a following that they can sustain in the championship to come back up.

If Notts Forest get relegated this year, they're in a shit ton of trouble in the championship, a huge amount of players on massive contracts that they wont be able to afford to keep paying. Either contracts will be ripped up or players sold for cheap. 

&#x200B;

Also, i could understand the animosity towards Levy 2-3 years ago but the last 2 years? The guy has spent over £300M on Conte so far, we've even spent some of Levys/Lewis own money, something thats never happened before.

He deserves criticism for hiding from the fans and not giving us a coherent plan moving forward but the spending is way up.",Spurs,Yes,jaqlciy,t1_jaqczmy

"No. He isn’t good enough for a team with any type of ambition. If he played sparingly as a bench player sure, but that is not the case. No other big 6 side would be happy with Ben Davies as their starter",Spurs,Yes,jaqg5il,t1_jaqfh6r

"I wasn't even Conte out before Sheffield (and I still am not very strongly Conte out), but a lot of people on this sub are very tired of Conte. Trust me most spurs fans would rather sell Kane in this scenario. Me personally if I think our best shot at keeping Kane is appointing a manager like Tuchel (since Conte is going to leave anyways) which I would be all for, but I also get the need for a rebuild. 

I get it, you want to keep both Conte and Kane and I respect you for that opinion, but I feel like it is a lost cause with Conte because he wants to leave.",Spurs,Yes,jarf9dl,t1_jareng0

*Resulting in or providing a large amount or supply of something*

As in Lucas was our most productive in providing any semblance of a chance / goal / assist. I know the score but a player can be productive or creative without directly scoring or assisting hence my previous comment.

There was no need for the rudeness in your previous comment, as for Danjuma I don’t disagree that maybe he should’ve started instead but at the same time it’s evident we’re not seriously looking to activate that buy clause so neither of them are going to be here next season, Danjuma or not we should’ve beaten Sheffield fucking United.

Those were good times, but those shouldn't be our best memories. We should be winning a Carabao cup at least. I still remember us sacking Jose right before the cup final and it still hurts me.

"Agree, the dude is a warrior and I always saw him as more a Ben Davies type for the team, strong team guy that works hard but is a rotation player.

That's the theory how it should be but that's not how it plays out. Qualify regularly and all you get is funds diverted to build a stadium and a transfer window blankout.

Even worse considering weve had the likes of Kane, son, lloris, and not even on insane wages compared to some other players",Spurs,Yes,jarxgor,t1_jarnun6
"> Investment required to go from a Top 4 squad to a trophy challenging squad is more than the revenue increase from actually winning that trophy vs a Top 4

That doesn't make any sense. A team that can challenge for top 4 will be able to challenge for trophies.",Spurs,Yes,jary4ns,t1_jarnun6
Why wouldn't they sell then?  Given they take nothing out of the club.,Spurs,Yes,jarsnji,t1_jarkctz
"agreed. They say they want to make cheap signings and be like Brighton but they can't get deals like Kim Min Jae, Grealish, or Khvicha over the line. People still aren't even talking about that. ENIC just don't have a vision.",Spurs,Yes,jark22h,t1_jarj0i5
What are you talking about? Tons of posts and comments on here in the last few days blaming ENIC. Plenty of them coming from me. I wanna know why that doesn’t count as people being up in arms?,Spurs,Yes,jas1k51,t1_jas192t
"He'd  be good but just saw a report Chelsea might be paying his release clause.   
Conte or not next season I hope we switch to a back 4.",Spurs,Yes,jawc4bd,t1_jatc3at
"That’s the other point. For the past 4 years especially, when we have spent money, 90% of it goes to flops. That’s the reason I don’t care about top 4 this season, last summer it felt like the perfect time to kick on, they didn’t bring in a single fucking upgrade.",Spurs,Yes,jaqgclc,t1_jaqfz27
"I mean, probably better for you to fuck off. I'm still supporting the team whereas you're just whinging and crying about how players should leave and weaken the team. If all you do is bitch and moan you're hardly enjoying it so you should find something better to do with your time.",Spurs,Yes,jatgc0n,t1_jat4gvf
"Need to see more from him, before I would make judgement. Even a win with Germany at the Euros wont convince me because international football is different.",Spurs,Yes,jarojnj,t1_jarny3y
"Davies is not the issue. Wanna see him remain. Sanchez needa fuck off, and so does Dier tbh even tho i know he gives us his all. Davies aint a starter tho but great depth and squad player.",Spurs,Yes,jaqh17g,t1_jaqg5il
"Ben Davies is literally a better LB than the current top of the tables pair, the problem with our defence is Dier when your centre CB is a donkey its make the whole back line look worse, look at how many times Davies had to make big clearances against West ham because Dier went AWOL",Spurs,Yes,jaqgnmv,t1_jaqg5il
No. I do not owe this stupidity a discussion.,Spurs,Yes,jat3aoy,t1_jaszrmm
"Reminds me of the stupid republican democrat i keep seeing from americans, idk how u could sound nore illiterate tbh",Spurs,Yes,jausf34,t1_jatdebf
The ENIC out boomers on Twitter and Spurs Community are not the same people here lmao,Spurs,Yes,jatixzo,t1_jatdebf
"You are free to express your opinion here or anywhere for that matter I'm not on Twitter but I know on Youtube Levy In supporters are actively encouraged to come out of the woodwork to show their faces and put voices to their debates that further the debate this is why Youtube as a platform is much superior to Reddit because right now it feels much more impartial and fans from different spectrums are allowed to air their views without being brigaded, bullied and mass downvoted and a number of them do with solid and rational debates but for some odd reason still many of them choose to remain in the shadows and unknown. It's only on Reddit for some reason where the debate isn't being had honestly, bullying, brigading and mass downvoting is a big thing on Reddit for some reason and this is why this sub reddit is actually far less meaningful. 

I don't believe calling people stupid, wankers, brigading and mass downvoting is shutting anything down you merely stifle the debate and kick the can down the road you don't defeat it in any way shape, or form. I also don't see why people on here struggle to have an honest debate on our ownership without strawman debates, insults, and clear aggression.",Spurs,Yes,jatmbll,t1_jatdebf
"I'm genuinely questioning that myself, legit don't understand why we keeping them. But, looks, its only been a year since we got a legit DoF, someone who we can trust with the football decision, after Levy handling them himself for years.

Oh I see sorry. So you’ve come up with this “prophecy” based on two showings?,Spurs,Yes,jaqjlub,t1_jaqg6td
If you put those players into our system we wouldn’t suddenly play the same as they do. The systems are entirely different,Spurs,Yes,jar7oms,t1_jar7lg7
Even worse y'all,Spurs,Yes,jaqxh3x,t1_jaquf70
That doesn’t make him bigger than the club because their peaks aren’t the same nor are their records. And Son doesn’t even come close to Kane consistency wise,Spurs,Yes,jaqvlq5,t1_jaquh8w
"yes, 1,000%

harry is the best thing to happen to this club in the last half century. why in the fuck would someone want to see him leave for the sake of replacing one manager that isn't thriving with another manager who isn't going to thrive",Spurs,Yes,jarmt22,t1_jarjw8m
">I get it, you want to keep both Conte and Kane

I defo want to keep Kane, not really bothered about keeping Conte in all honesty",Spurs,Yes,jarg156,t1_jarf9dl
Considering our last trophy was a league cup I don’t really think you can be picky like that anyway,Spurs,Yes,jaqz6sw,t1_jaqz3vp
"I do agree it's ridiculous to even talk about the FA Cup in the same breath as the Caravan Cup. 

But I personally don't see it as a Jekyll trophy any more. It's the same top clubs competiting for it as at the FA cup. I would love to win a league cup at this point.",Spurs,Yes,jar38p6,t1_jaqz3vp
Bore off no one has forced him to stay,Spurs,Yes,jar1sb2,t1_jar0dde
"We are Tottenham fans, not Harry Kane fans. I hope with every fiber he stays and becomes a Premier League legend in his own right. He'd be regarded as untouchable amongst our fanbase. 

If he does go then that's fine. But the day he leaves is the day I stop rooting for or caring about him.",Spurs,Yes,jar5ga7,t1_jar0dde
"it's not a vacuum. 

not starting richarlison would have been daft. Son.. ....debatable. 

but the decision to start a player who has been been more useless than not for the last 2 years and is running out of contract over a young exciting player that just scored on their debut is factually a bad decision. 

but yes. moura shouldn't be criticized personally.",Spurs,Yes,jasj7dt,t1_jashbf3
I violated my rule of going on Twitter and Reddit after Wednesday’s loss…both are so toxic after a loss.,Spurs,Yes,jarfnjc,t1_jarczaz
"you seem genuinely miserable with only a recent experience of supporting this club from thousands of miles away, and probably shouldn't be speaking for those of us that grew up supporting this club. 

again, plenty of great memories and not going to let losses crumble them",Spurs,Yes,jarn96o,t1_jarktbx
"This woe is me, Spurs suck attitude is so pathetic. Y'all don't think the players can feel that energy? Everyday before the Sheffield match it's Dr. Tottenham this, I've seen this one before.",Spurs,Yes,jarna35,t1_jarktbx
"You must be a new fan then. Many worse memories than those you just mentioned (other than champions league loss obviously). Also many better memories than what you mentioned. Supporting tottenham comes with a lot of misery, but that makes the good moments even greater. What about beating chelsea at stamford bridge or beating man u at old trafford for the first time after 20 odd years. These may not be as grand of an achievement as some other big clubs but for me they are incredible memories as a fan.",Spurs,Yes,jarnpkd,t1_jarktbx
Hahahhaha,Spurs,Yes,jaqvk05,t1_jaqvehm
"Alright I see what you are doing. LFG! 

Hey Arsenal, Champions of Europe you'll never sing that! Yessir!! Lets Go!",Spurs,Yes,jarggwg,t1_jarft6u

[deleted],Spurs,Yes,jas462y,t1_jas12wa
Tbf I completely agree with that bogeyman mentality and it’s not something just isolated to Spurs but seems to have manifested itself in politics (not just UK) in the past decade. It’s sad that it’s such a struggle nowadays to have a coherent debate with someone when its so much easier to be noisy and angry.,Spurs,Yes,jar7iga,t1_jar5rwo
I'm not saying they weren't credible publications. Just that it's something that happens every time a manager is on their way out.,Spurs,Yes,jas7n2n,t1_jas7fws
"To compete for FA/EFL cups, you need squad depth more than a first team. And to compete for PL/CL, a  Top 4 team is not good enough.   
For both cases, investment outwieghs the reward.",Spurs,Yes,jaryog7,t1_jary4ns
"It's obvious isn't it? They haven't gotten an offer that meets their valuation of the club

In the meantime they can just scoop up record profits and keep raising their compensation while adding low-cost improvements that raise the eventual sale price

Win-win situation for them",Spurs,Yes,jart0t1,t1_jarsnji
"People talk about it all day, every day on here.",Spurs,Yes,jarsr6b,t1_jark22h
"I couldn't even care less if he got sacked by Germany, international football doesn't do anything for me. Flick was absolutely amazing at Bayern and he was decent at Hoffenheim as well.",Spurs,Yes,jarous5,t1_jarojnj
"That is my point about Davies. He’s fine on the squad, but as mainly a bench piece. Any team with ambition would have upgraded and moved him to the bench long ago, but not ENIC.",Spurs,Yes,jaqh9ee,t1_jaqh17g
"Delusional. Davies is a bench talent. Period. Full Stop.

Edit: I see why your a Davies fanboy, you can’t remotely look at him objectively, so there is no point to discussing this further.",Spurs,Yes,jaqhbl0,t1_jaqgnmv
Okay,Spurs,No,jat3oup,t1_jat3aoy
"On some level I do find this ENIC-Out situation interesting if you look at it politically. I was trying to explain to my Uncle whom I attend games with how many parallels there are between ENIC-Out groups and real life political groups, I don't think he was half as interested in the theory as me lol.",Spurs,Yes,javlt1z,t1_jausf34
Yes. It's more of a sort of cold shot kind of thing. Like if I was a betting man I'd put money on it. But I'm not so instead i make snarky comments in the daily discussion thread,Spurs,Yes,jaqk0uf,t1_jaqjlub
We play system with the players we have at best the way we could play. Conte has said this multiple times. Madrid has players who play with addition of creativity in their system. Ancelloti gives them lot of freedom the way they want to play. Conte dont give that freedom because our defenders arent capable to manage if sudden counter attack happens.,Spurs,Yes,jar8z7e,t1_jar7oms
"Yeah, yeah, you hate Son, we know. Give it up already.",Spurs,Yes,jar937y,t1_jaqvlq5
"Would you be willing to bring Tuchel in if it meant bringing Kane in? 

I definitely would, but it seems like some fans don't. 

I just realized thought that Hansi Flick is a really intriguing option",Spurs,Yes,jarn2eb,t1_jarmt22
"If you want to keep Kane, would you be willing to hire a guy like Tuchel if it meant Kane stays? (you already know my answer). I get he is ex-chelsea and all of that, but it would be different under tuchel.",Spurs,Yes,jargmxb,t1_jarg156
"It’s a competition I don’t think should exist in the first place, would feel anticlimactic if that’s how we end it",Spurs,Yes,jaqzi4j,t1_jaqz6sw
"It feels weird for people to write it off when its the last trophy we won, should we write off 2008 as well in that case? And say our actual trophy drought goes as far back as 90/91 lmao",Spurs,Yes,jar50do,t1_jar38p6
He is already a PL legend,Spurs,Yes,jar9rsm,t1_jar5ga7
"I actually get what you are saying, but it is about expectations for me. If Kane and Son are staying, I expect us to be competing for trophies. I get it though, it is much more fun when your expectations are lower. I think I'd feel better about that if we would just rebuild already. I became a fan like 2 years before Poch was hired so I guess you can say I am very lucky, but I have seen how much a rebuild can improve a fans morale as well as the club. I want to be back in that time again. This era where we should be winning trophies and winning fuck all really isn't giving me much to be excited about. That old trafford win and stamford bridge win was definitely glorious though. I'll give you that.",Spurs,Yes,jarojfg,t1_jarnpkd
"I'd say it's very close though, I'd probably put it at 40/60 in gooner's favour, but Arsenal have already shown signs of cracking. Hope those cracks continue to grow.",Spurs,Yes,jaqoms7,t1_jaqmd6s
"But City can rely on that outcome from just one result in the weekend of the etihad game - a result they can control. Every other weekend they have to rely on 2 results to yield the same points outcome and only be able to control 50% of those results.

Of course nobody can know what will happen I just question your certainty that Arsenal going 10-0-3 is the most likely probability",Spurs,Yes,jas4w3q,t1_jas462y
"Yeah, it's sad really. And when it comes to this sort of thing, it's always easier to dissent than stick to the status quo - at least online.

Ultimately, I just want whatever is best for the club ENIC in or Out, but feel in order to counterbalance the hate that's thrown towards them, there needs to be a similar response the other way. 

I don't really want to spend my time defending a billionaire and his minion, but I also don't think it's fair to assume that you need to be ENIC Out to want the club to succeed.",Spurs,Yes,jar99c7,t1_jar7iga
But what I’m trying to say is these pieces by these publications would have sources aka leaks,Spurs,Yes,jas7r3m,t1_jas7n2n
"> To compete for FA/EFL cups, you need squad depth more than a first team.

No you don't. Arsenal won multiple FA cups with team that was barely top four level and not much depth. Leicester won an FA cup with no real depth either.",Spurs,Yes,jarz1gi,t1_jaryog7
"We make a loss every year, and they have never taken any money out of the club except Levy's salary which he worlds full time for.

By comparison the Glazers have taken £1.64bn out of United directly into their pockets.

I am more than up for debating the leadership but ignorant fact-free comments like this don't exactly make your case.

I really want to know what the ENIC-out brigade are saying we should have down, and how we would have paid for it.",Spurs,Yes,jarx377,t1_jart0t1
"Well, cant disagree, but i think u need to give him crsdit this season. He geniunelt was good at lwb. Dont wanna see him start next season tho, or wanna see him alternating with udogie and used as a back up lcb as well",Spurs,Yes,jaqtbcq,t1_jaqh9ee
a 'bench piece'?,Spurs,Yes,jaqqnxj,t1_jaqh9ee
"Why I'm a Davies fan boy? Because I'm welsh? You're deluded not me, ull agree he ain't suited for centre back I think he's too small and lacks strength but the season he was at his best under poch he played on the left he's played on the left twice and contributed, so wipe the tears from your eyes and watch a game without blinkers on",Spurs,Yes,jaqi4mo,t1_jaqhbl0
Doesn’t look like you’re discussing it anyway tbh,Spurs,Yes,jaqrm0y,t1_jaqhbl0
I definitely notice it each time.  Parallels are unreal between enic out and conservatives in America.,Spurs,Yes,javmk00,t1_javlt1z
"We play the system Conte has trained the players to play. Your original point was that we play the same type of football as Real Madrid do under Ancelotti, which isn’t remotely true",Spurs,Yes,jar9611,t1_jar8z7e
"I don’t? I hate how he plays in this system yeah.

Regardless, how exactly can you agree about Son being held in the same breath as Kane with respect to Spurs? They are light years apart",Spurs,Yes,jar9cbv,t1_jar937y
"Tough question tbh if it is with the assumption that Kane only stays if Tuchel comes in. Tuchel is nowhere near the top of my list for who I want to come in, but seeing Kane leave would be the most painful exit since Bale left for me",Spurs,Yes,jargxz8,t1_jargmxb
"No Tuchel, no more Chelsea rejects! I’m tired of sloppy seconds. Rather take a punt on another manager. We should pay over the top and get Zidane. Or maybe if Klopp gets sacked we can convince him to come.",Spurs,Yes,jarja7y,t1_jargmxb
We've had good enoguh teams over the last 6 or 7 years to have won something which I think is why it's so baffling that we haven't. I completely agree with what you said about poch and the morale with the fans. The feeling of hope and believing that we were truly building something special with poch is something I hope we can get again soon. I think most fans just want to see us play attractive attacking football again which is something we haven't had for a few years now. Feels like there's not much to be excited over even with champions league. But football can be unpredictable and I do belive our time will come soon,Spurs,Yes,jarqiyz,t1_jarojfg
[deleted],Spurs,Yes,jas6691,t1_jas4w3q
"I want ENIC Out of their arses and In with a fucking plan and vision for the club that’s not go-karts

If they could present some semblance of a plan I’d be backing them to the hilt but how long can the aimless lurching from manager to manager in the hopes they can fix the entirety of the football side of the “entertainment franchise” that Tottenham Hotspur have become go on? What are they even doing up there in their little glass holes?",Spurs,Yes,jarhrdu,t1_jar99c7
"Yeah, which happens every time, there are always some unhappy players in every squad",Spurs,Yes,jas7wa2,t1_jas7r3m
Forest for the trees stuff really,Spurs,Yes,jarxl67,t1_jarx377
"Not just America, but wherever you might be living. It's interesting how difficult it is to argue in favour of the status quo, because the side of change can always say ""X is bad, let's just make it better."" ""we'll fix that."" they can always fix anything in theory.

I think Brexit makes an interesting comparison to ENIC-Out. But generalyl this is the state of political discourse globally. Us Vs. Them instead of working together on a compromise. (At least, in my view)",Spurs,Yes,javpuqq,t1_javmk00
"Son has been better in the champions league historically compared to Kane. Because Poch started Kane over Lucas, we bottled the final. We should have just stuck with the lineup. that was poch's worst mistake. 

either ways I get what you are saying. kane means more to spurs, but in terms of legacy, but of them haven't won shit, so they are being spoken in the same breath. In terms of talent, Kane is better. There is an argument that Son is definitely more clutch.",Spurs,Yes,jardkhi,t1_jar9cbv
"who would be on the top of the list (without considering Kane leaving or not)? We can include Conte staying as a possibility if you want. 

Although, I will say (I don't think Kane stays if Poch comes back and I do think him staying would be heavily dependent on the manager)",Spurs,Yes,jari7hu,t1_jargxz8
"Zidane and Klopp are unlikely to leave their clubs or join spurs. Zidane wants PSG or france, and Klopp probably wants the Germany NT job. I agree though, if you don't want sloppy seconds, we should go after managers like De Zerbi or Gallardo. (I really like Gallardo).",Spurs,Yes,jarluac,t1_jarja7y
"I really like and appreciate your optimism, but I'm not sure. Right now it seems like to me that Arsenal and United will be on top of the league every year again, and we are just back in the early 2000s. Maybe if we go back to building something special like we did under Pochettino, what you are saying is possible, but I'm really worried man.",Spurs,Yes,jarr8qd,t1_jarqiyz
Because if they control that outcome to a win that takes away 3 points Arsenal can drop elsewhere and thus put even more pressure on them to win elsewhere,Spurs,Yes,jas6g1r,t1_jas6691
"That's very fair

Something is missing, there's no doubt. Whether that could be recaptured with \#Pochback I'm not too sure, but there must be some way to make the football more fun to watch.

Perhaps my annoyance lies more with those who'd rather we become a sportswashing front, than those who feel that we could set a better path with more ambitious ownership. The options for how we do that sustainably without feeling too morally bereft are few and far between, but if something comes along that fits the bill then I'd be very happy to get ENIC Out of Spurs.",Spurs,Yes,jarnri7,t1_jarhrdu
"Ehh we’ll see if it happens with Antonio, I’m adamant the Jose / Poch leaker has left the club.",Spurs,Yes,jas840a,t1_jas7wa2
Yeah I am not American but I am just exposed alot to it online haha. The polarization is a common phenomena yeah,Spurs,Yes,javqbdk,t1_javpuqq
"Honestly I don’t have a definite list, I just want a manager who gives the fans something to get behind. Somewhat like Conte was last season where his personality was infectious and it felt like we were actually moving in a forward direction. Obviously I’d like a manager that played front-foot, attacking football, and managers such as De Zerbi and Gallardo are the flavours of the month and would at least offer entertaining football. 

If Conte could get back to seeming fully involved in the project and showed some kind of desire to stay, and dropped the ‘I’m doing a small team a favour’ type of attitude, I would be fine with that (mainly because chopping and changing managers so frequently is tiring and nowhere near ideal).

I also agree that I think Kane would leave if Poch came back",Spurs,Yes,jarjjtt,t1_jari7hu
[deleted],Spurs,Yes,jas83wz,t1_jas6g1r
"I am in total agreeance, I just want someone who knows what they want and how to get there in a footballing sense. 

ENIC very good at financial planning and execution but totally incapable of applying the same paradigm to football. It's extremely strange. They are clearly smart enough to have a goal and put together the means to accomplish it when it comes to finance. When it comes to football they're reactionary and emotional and have absolutely no clue what to do, hoping managers will just handle all the tricky bits that they don't want to do.",Spurs,Yes,jars2pp,t1_jarnri7
It happened with Nuno too. It's a universal thing that happens with any manager as they reach the end of their tenures at any club,Spurs,Yes,jas924b,t1_jas840a
"I don't think Conte wants to stay at Spurs. So we should just let him go. Unironically Tuchel grew up to be a Spurs fans (or at least ""rooted"" for them when he was a child). I do know Poch wouldn't disrespect the club as much as Conte has as well. Its a tough decision. But yeah, for me Personally, I'd want Gallardo or Tuchel.",Spurs,Yes,jarkfwm,t1_jarjjtt
"Yes and it’s a game where they can deny Arsenal 3 points themselves, rather than hoping other teams do it. That massively changes the playing field from a scenario where they’ve already played each other twice and Arsenal have to go 10-0-3, even though it’s the same number of games and points available in both universes. 

That Forest game was also an aberration. In the first half of this season when city dropped points it’s cos they played badly and deserved to lose. They deserved to win against forest and outplayed them but got unlucky. In the last few games city’s performances have hugely improved and they’ve looked again like the team who went on mad multi-game winning runs to claim previous titles",Spurs,Yes,jas9frg,t1_jas83wz
Tuchel’s reputation definitely took a bit of a hit while being at Chelsea (despite winning the CL lmao) but Chelsea are a hierarchical mess atm. His Dortmund side were very progressive but I’m kind of of the camp of no more ex-Chelsea managers and no more 3 at the back,Spurs,Yes,jarksuv,t1_jarkfwm
"I feel you. I'm just worried Kane won't stay unless we bring in a top manager. Like I think he leaves if we bring in Poch, or even De Zerbi or Luis Enrique, etc. He might be willing to stay under Gallardo but there is also a risk there but it might be a shout. Klopp and Zidane aren't leaving either. If we are able to poach Spalleti, I think Kane would stay though, but thats even kind of a pipe dream although I still want to believe. Hansi Flick is someone I just thought of who I think would be worth a GREAT shout.",Spurs,Yes,jarm72e,t1_jarksuv
Still livid after last night. So sick of watching us embarrassingly chuck cup competitions by thinking we’re just too good to not roll lower league/lesser teams over.,Spurs,No,jalp582,t3_11fursc
Could’ve been playing Blackburn at home in the quarter final,Spurs,No,jalr49w,t3_11fursc
"I'm tired. I've supported this club for over 20 years now, starting from when Arsenal were having their golden age under wenger.

It's absolutely mind blowing to me that despite how bad they've been over the last 6-7 years they still managed to get their hands on a few fa cups whilst we have nothing. NOTHING. To show for it. Our best chance to win a cup this season and yet again, they've blown it. To a championship side that played its b team.

Fucking Wrexham gave them more of a headache than that. Now, looking at the draw, we would have been up against bloody blackburn. What a great chance to win a trophy thrown away once again.

Half the team isn't good enough. Conte isn't good enough. How tf did we spend more than the runners over the course of this season and end up so far behind them? This side simply doesn't care enough to win otherwise they'd have grabbed something like even a carabao cup by now. You can say Man u got an easy draw or whatever to win the cup but we were eliminated by fucking NOTTINGHAM FOREST that, may I remind everyone, united thrashed comfortably.

I'm sick and tired of it, being the eternal joke in the footballing world. We're not a 'big 6 side', one carabao cup in the entire premier league era (which man u equalled in 6 months under eth) is bloody pathetic.",Spurs,No,jam05l0,t3_11fursc
"Really obvious thought about the lineup last night: you cannot attempt to play three forwards into form simultaneously. Richarlison has been off form since the WC, Son has been off form since pre-season, and this was Moura's first start of the season. You need some players who are confident and playing well in the attack, to help the ones who aren't.",Spurs,No,jam4yee,t3_11fursc
"Had some work during the game

Did that work

Disabled notifications on my phone

Didn’t open any social media

Came home at night

Made dinner, and sat down to watch the full replay without knowing the score

Fully expect us to go out to AC Milan next Wednesday too bc Antonio Conte hasn't won a Champions League knockout tie in 10 years,Spurs,No,jalw43m,t3_11fursc
"Don't worry, friends. We're still in one more cup competition. All we have to do is -checks notes- win the Champions League.",Spurs,No,jam96mn,t3_11fursc
Think Danjuma deserves a start at Wolves just for having the self-control to watch what Son and Richarlison did for 80 minutes without walking out of the stadium.,Spurs,No,jalrc58,t3_11fursc
"As an Australian supporter, there’s nothing more depressing than waking up to see we have shit the bed or are in the process of doing so. Ruins the day. 

Could I buy yet another streaming service and watch it live? Yes, but why would I want to do that to myself.",Spurs,No,jalnse2,t3_11fursc
I would like to go a week as a Tottenham fan without suffering please and thank you,Spurs,No,jaln42t,t3_11fursc
"We had a clear run to the final and we didn’t take the competition seriously, again. I will never get over the appalling team selection we choose to have in the cups every year. Would it have hurt to start Romero and give him an hour? Or Kane? Just to give us an actual chance to take the game to them. That was peak dross against a team that could barely handle Wrexham ffs",Spurs,No,jaly2ob,t3_11fursc

Now across the season how many clear cut chances have we had Kane has scored 18 goals from ~13xG Bentancur has scored 5 from ~2.2xG and Højbjerg 4 from ~1.5 xG.

Son has 5 goals from ~5.5xG and Kulusevski 2 goals from ~1.4xG.

We start slow so that the crowd gets into the game, and then they sense an opportunity so bring on their actually good players who are capable of making a chance like the one they scored.

Dumitrescu £2.6m, Popescu £2.9m, Armstrong £4.5m, Ferdinand £6m, Rebrov £11m, Bent £16.5m, Paulinho £17m, Soldado £26m, Sissoko £30m, Sanchez £42m, Ndombele £55m.

What a truly depressing list. Even Les Ferdinand - who's generally remembered fondly - was injury plagued and only scored 12 goals in his first 3 seasons.

Our overall record transfer list looks no better - many would say it looks even worse (especially with Richarlison's current struggles)

"Some random incoherent thoughts I need to get off my chest:

* the amount of times I yelled ""What is he doing???"" at Sanchez last night was insane.

* I don't understand the people that ramble about CL money all the time. It's like they pocket that money themselves... What's the point of qualifying for the CL just for the sake of the money? So we can attract better players? Where are these better players? Almost all of our recent(4-5-6 years) signings lost 75% of their value the moment they stepped foot on a field for us. Our transfers have been fucking awful. Or do we want CL so desperately so we can barely escape a group stage consisting of Eintracht Frankfurt, Marseille and Sporting, or because Inter couldn't beat PSV at home, or flat out fail to get out of a group consisting of Monaco, Bayer Leverkusen and CSKA Moscow? I guess it's better than losing to Rennes, Vitesse and whoever the fuck else we played. Holy shit, Mura was it???

* It's been 4 years since I last truly enjoyed watching us play football, apart from 1 of the last Poch games where we were leading I think Palace at home 3-0 after 20-something minutes, I actually cried with joy then because I thought we were back... and apart from the Mou spell at the beginning, until West Ham. It's been 4 years of absolutely dreadful football. I used to regularly watch Spurs games with my dad, he's not a big football fan, but I was happy when I could show him how attractively my club played and we could spend time together. We've watched barely anything these past 4 years because I don't want to burden him with the absolute dross on display game after game, and with my sour mood either.

* I was in a really really dark place up until like 5-6 years ago, and Spurs were genuinely one of two things that kept me alive. The thing that got me up every morning was the thought ""how many days until Spurs play next?"" I loved Spurs so much I didn't think it was possible that I'd lose interest and that I *wouldn't* think about the next game upon waking up. Well... I guess 4 years of freefall would do that. I've been a Spurs fan since the first Spurs game I watched back in 2007 and I had never ever missed a game that I could watch from 2008 until now, even friendlies. I've watched maybe half of our games in 2023. I don't care when we play or who we play anymore. But contrary to what some would say, it's not because I'm not a ""real fan"", quite the opposite, it's because I care a lot and it hurts far too much to be a Spurs fan right now.

You can argue team selection if you want, I won't here and probably agree regardless about the mentality it sets, but we were what, three?, players away from our best available XI and playing against a team who also had no manager and was giving the first competitive start to some child in midfield. How the fuck does a team that's not won anything have the arrogance to not simply not advance, but even play properly for the majority of the game?

Just wall to wall dogshit. I think I'd let Davies and maybe Forster off from criticism for last night but that's about it.

I quite simply never want to see Lucas Moura play for us ever again. Davinson Sanchez somehow still continues to regress year-on-year from the player he was for Ajax six years ago. I like Richarlison but the no goals stuff is alarming now and this was his shot to play in his favoured position and he fucked it. The zone of negative chemistry that is Son and Perisic continues. Eric Dier, who I also like, has now been given the captain's armband for what is, for me, the worst domestic cup exits we've had in recent history with this game and Colchester in the League Cup a few years back (I get we've had some other poor cup exits and maybe it's just as this one is so fresh in the memory and the remaining pool of teams is so bad but it's got to be right up there).

Defending for their goal was just shit, and it's only because what happened in front of him was so bad that I'm not throwing Forster under the bus, but he probably could have done better as well. I think I haven't namechecked Porro yet (not the impact you'd want from a RWB in this system but it's only his second game or whatever for us so reserving judgement) and Davies gets a pass as the goal wasn't really his fault, and if you're needing your left centre back to help with the attack then a shit load of other things have gone wrong. Hojbjerg and Sarr just meh. Hojbjerg for the goal it looks awful, I get he was trying to not give away a penalty but I think he could have done a lot more and not done so. Who is left? Kane and Kulusevski feels a bit harsh but were on enough to make some difference and while we were better going forward the key stat of goals scored still reads 0. Perisic putting in probably his best cross since the world cup (that isn't necessarily a compliment) for Kane to head it that far wide at the death really was just the cherry on top of a completely dogshit performance.

He’s a player that relies on his pace and agility, which are  a few of the first attributes that vanish for a footballer once they start getting on the wrong side of thirty, which Son is approaching.

Why do we need 4th keeper? Either Austin or Whiteman needs to go. Earn that little bit of money.

With the return of Udogie and Reguilon, we will have four left backs. I would say that Reguilon needs to go; sell him for about 20m. Perisic can't defend. Maybe playing him as attacker is a better option.

Ah, the midfield. Lo Celso and Ndombele could also earn us that little bit of money. Don't seem to need them at all.

With Perisic being killing momentum and Son poor with his back to goal it would have been great to have a player who can both hold the ball and bring others in as well as beat a man from a standing start on the left.",Spurs,Yes,jaltz17,t1_jalrc58
I feel so bad for you guys. Having to wake up in the middle of the night to watch us play terror football every week qualifies as self harm atp. I would have checked out years ago if I had to wake up at 4-5 AM to watch Mourinhos spurs concede 2 late goals and get beat for a whole season.,Spurs,Yes,jalo9s1,t1_jalnse2
The fact that all 4 competitions are on 4 separate services is brutal now considering it used to be on just 2 a couple seasons ago.,Spurs,Yes,jamcyfr,t1_jalnse2
You’ll get three days tops and like it,Spurs,Yes,jalp68e,t1_jaln42t
"We created a ton of chances. That’s what the tactics do. We couldn’t finish. That’s what the players do.

Richy’s finishing was woeful, Son is deep in his own head and lacking confidence, Lucas was alright but still ineffective, both WBs had a couple errant shots and a few wandering crosses. The final ball was usually shit and the chances that were created went unfinished.",Spurs,Yes,jam397v,t1_jam21s5
the only reasonable defence of it is if Danjuma isn’t doing great in training which was the reason for Spence and Bissouma not getting minutes at first and obviously we wouldn’t be able to tell if this is the case. But I agree I’d much rather see Danjuma so hopefully they’re not just putting Moura ahead of him for experience and seniority or whatever.,Spurs,Yes,jalda14,t1_jald3ku
Moura played well to be fair.,Spurs,Yes,jalgf1j,t1_jald3ku
">we're judging Richarlison as a flop and Son as being awful but in the game yesterday alone how many clear cut chances did they really have?

You're talking as if these guys have no impact on whether we create chances or not. Very odd. People are criticising Son and Richy for their failure to control the fucking ball.",Spurs,Yes,jalh8rp,t1_jalfdi6
We have only one truly creative player in Kulu. We need a creator on the left which Son isn’t. We also need creators at WB. Porro is creative but he’s just getting integrated and idk what the fuck happened to Perisic,Spurs,Yes,jalg71p,t1_jalfdi6
Its not a surprise tbh our best way of consistently creating chances in open play is playing out from the back then firing a low pass into kane who holds it up against 3 defenders at a time then kane switches it into a wingback bombing on who crosses into the box with 1 teammate in there,Spurs,Yes,jaligd1,t1_jalfdi6
The away support was excellent. Shame the players didn't put in half the effort,Spurs,Yes,jalj1me,t1_jaliovp
You guys deserve a statue for paying actual money to travel and support these bunch of rats,Spurs,Yes,jalmjkv,t1_jaliovp
">Someone at least tell me our away support sounded good,

Actually, it really did.",Spurs,Yes,jaloq54,t1_jaliovp
"Could hear you loud and clear on the tv coverage, you are very much appreciated by us 👏👏",Spurs,Yes,jamasdp,t1_jaliovp
">im Sheffield

typo or German?",Spurs,Yes,jamzgvo,t1_jaliovp
"It’s painful, Kane/Son/Richarlison/Kulusevski were supposed to be one of the best attacking cores in the league and 3/4 have been massively disappointing. It’s bizarre given that all 4 had great seasons last year.",Spurs,Yes,jamcydj,t1_jam8ceh
"I think Kulu has had a tough time coming back from injury personally.

Son on the other hand I think may be on the downslope of his career, at this point it really doesn’t seem just like poor form when it’s been ongoing all season.",Spurs,Yes,jamhbvo,t1_jam8ceh
"Moments towards the end of the match last night, Son was so frustrating to watch. At one point around the 90' a 70/30 ball was sort of in the air between him and another player on the edge of the box and he just throws a leg at it aimlessly and into nothing. Really sad to see, if Conte stays I can't see how Son will work in this system effectively. Kulusevski very off the boil as well.",Spurs,Yes,jamir0v,t1_jam8ceh
"What I really don't get is Conte is historically a domestic merchant who focuses all energy on one trophy per year. It obviously wasn't going to be the league, so I don't understand the mentality yesterday at all.",Spurs,Yes,jaluam8,t1_jalqum7
I mean Mourinho did reach a Carabao cup final.,Spurs,Yes,jamezh7,t1_jalqum7
What did Dier even do wrong lol it’s so crazy how the mentality here is “oh we lost? Blame Dier” our worst players last night by far were Perisic and Richarlison,Spurs,Yes,jam4eja,t1_jam47wv
"Next year we will have another defensive mamager with third choice transfers at 40m ""cause the prem is getting too expensive!!!"", and losing again",Spurs,Yes,jamh7uv,t1_jamb7n3
"Worst team in the league to watch (maybe excluding Southampton), absolutely zero excitement or danger.",Spurs,Yes,jam17ja,t1_jalmx29
Doesn’t help that most of them are shite,Spurs,Yes,jao6kzk,t1_janyt9m
Let's not forget we lost to forest B in the league cup as well,Spurs,Yes,jalyi2q,t1_jalwjzh
We just can't creat chances for our forwards. I think the team was good enough to win but the way we play always gives the initiative to the opposition,Spurs,Yes,jaly0sw,t1_jalwjzh
Toxicity here is insane,Spurs,Yes,jameli1,t1_jam8d9g
"yeah its getting ridiculous, I get it we are all pretty fucking pissed and tired of this but Jesus man its still a game",Spurs,Yes,jam8txz,t1_jam8d9g
"thats honestly a shame. Although I'm not surprised. I think it starts from the fact that people can't seem to take that having different opinions doesn't make that person wrong. Honestly I think its really common on reddit. The downvote button also makes it easier to just ignore other people's opinions just because you don't want to hear them. 

Those abusive DMs should not be happening. Sorry about that.",Spurs,Yes,jam8ywi,t1_jam8d9g
I am contributing to the toxicity and I hate it but I hate the brain dead takes in here,Spurs,Yes,jamhcn7,t1_jam8d9g
We actually named him our captain in the previous round as well.,Spurs,Yes,jali847,t1_jalhw9q
The summer? End his contract now and pay him to leave.,Spurs,Yes,jali6x4,t1_jalhw9q
Exactly this. Was gonna compose a near identical comment. Watching the gradual step downs of the blindly optimistic is a sick kind of pleasure. By the time they realise we should have made a managerial change in January there will be nothing left to hold on to.,Spurs,Yes,jaml8dq,t1_jamile1
"lol thats how I feel except for the conference league part. I think we can get europa league at least and there still is a chance for top 4, I'm not too confident though.",Spurs,Yes,jamjhpk,t1_jamile1
Yea I see a lot of complaints about the lineup but every club has to rotate throughout the season. Especially with CL return leg looming our rotated squad has to be capable of managing Sheffield United's rotated team. We had some okay stretches creating half chances but large portions of the game we spent lumping it forward and giving it right back to them.,Spurs,Yes,jamp57q,t1_jamopju
"There was more than enough talent on the pitch to win that game comfortably. It was also a very experienced side that should know how to manage a game like that and get a result. There is really no excuse for it, besides the players not taking it seriously, which is astonishing.",Spurs,Yes,jampnon,t1_jamopju
"No it's worse, Sheffield United rotated too 💀",Spurs,Yes,jaljg2q,t1_jale91z
"Under which manager? But sure bring him back. 

Everyone has rose tinted glasses with Poch because he loves the club but everyone has amnesia about Poch post-UCL final. Not to mentioned all these transfers he wanted that are *still* a millstone around our neck",Spurs,Yes,jam3hhk,t1_jam0zx1
Get used to it mate. r/soccer is a huge circlejerk for that type of shit. The same rehashed jokes over and over and over.,Spurs,Yes,jao8jo9,t1_janzjwl
> Some people see ~~football~~ life like a Marvel movie or something i swear,Spurs,Yes,jaoh555,t1_janzjwl
We don’t make it easy on ourselves do we,Spurs,Yes,japz7a6,t1_janzjwl
He changed his mind like a week later and said something like five windows,Spurs,Yes,jan39xi,t1_jamz3by
"Well he still has one transfer window left doesn’t he? And next years transfer window will be our most important one because every player we want will be available and we’ll finally complete our rebuild

That is if Conte stays",Spurs,Yes,jan1p4j,t1_jamz3by
"Can relate to most of this, the season has been pretty dead from the start honestly. Here are the players we signed largely because of getting CL: Perisic, Richarlison, Bissouma, and Pedro Porro. None of them have been performing at an acceptable level. People want CL to see us compete against the biggest teams in Europe, but we don't even have a squad that can take us far enough in the competition. Now we're highly likely gonna enter the next season with Kane going to United and with a new manager (god knows how that's going to go after they passed on Ten Hag to go for Nuno), but somehow everything is okay because we have a chance against Milan and are still in the top 4, makes sense to me",Spurs,Yes,jalofhf,t1_jalka6e
"I dunno I think we all kind of agree with the narrative don't we? We are in a great spot for top 4, would be nice to know if conte is staying one way or another, the football is boring but can be effective. That's kind of agreed. 

I think last night was just a big flash point as it seems pretty obvious that the FA cup is a bigger priority for the fans than it is for the club?",Spurs,Yes,jambqot,t1_jam56s4
"I think the narrative is about the same that it's been for years now: our starting eleven can do a job, but our rotation options suck dick.",Spurs,Yes,jam5xin,t1_jam56s4
Hahahaha it’s hilarious,Spurs,Yes,jamo7v8,t1_jam56s4
"Hate to say it but yeah, he’s not got that Tom Brady about him as he would say

Indisputable legend of the game but tends to go missing when the chance at silverware is there",Spurs,Yes,jamng8a,t1_jammers
"We’re all mad, but come on Kane has scored probably 20 goals to win us games in the final few minutes. Off the top of my head city last year, PSV when were going out of the champions league groups a few years back, even the disallowed goal vs Sporting this year was a good finish",Spurs,Yes,jamypbm,t1_jammers
"why did we start Lucas Moura over Danjuma. Lucas was our best player, but that still doesn't excuse Conte for starting Lucas over Danjuma. Why did we buy Danjuma then? 

Bipolar or not, we have a right to be frustrated.",Spurs,Yes,jamrv0r,t1_jamrf8j
"Because the players we brought in weren’t as great as people were making them out to be 7 months ago. We also have a few injuries. We played with a rotated side against both Portsmouth and Preston, we won those games but we struggled almost as much as yesterday.  People were calling all week for the manager to play the strongest lineup, because it’s the best chance of us winning a trophy in a longtime considering the teams left in the mix, and sacrifice a result at Wolves if need be. 

It also doesn’t help that Conte hardly rotates and throws on all these players that barely have any individual minutes to play all together against a team that will absolutely be up for it. When the lineups were released so many of us immediately got worried because we’ve seen this shit for the past 6 years.",Spurs,Yes,jamtkv8,t1_jamrf8j
"A lot of people were saying we should rotate against Wolves, not Sheff U or Milan",Spurs,Yes,jamzb4c,t1_jamrf8j
"I just don’t see the point in finishing top 4 from a fan perspective vs winning the FA cup. I mean what’s going to bring me more joy? Getting drummed by AC Milan or Real or Man City in the quarters or winning a fucking trophy?  I get it from ENICs perspective. They need to cash to buy more real estate. But from where I’m sitting, it does me no good to get top 4 and bring in more players that will lose the FA CUP in round 4 to Dorchester and get hammered in the champions league quarters.",Spurs,Yes,jamtczz,t1_jamsbzf
"What did Arsenal do the 2 previous years?

Are Man City progression?  Chelsea?  Liverpool?

Your expectations are not aligned with reality - we are building a young side which is not ready yet.",Spurs,Yes,jamta37,t1_jamsbzf
The thing is Richarlison and Bissouma have looked really good in the prem. They look worse under this system though.,Spurs,Yes,jalio09,t1_jalgqvl
"Richarlison, Bissouma, Porro can come good in time. Perisic though is a complete mercenary",Spurs,Yes,jali3wr,t1_jalgqvl
Wouldn't that make us the common denominator of the problem?,Spurs,Yes,jalhit8,t1_jalgqvl
Porro might improve..give him time... although not sure about the price tag,Spurs,Yes,jaljrm5,t1_jalgqvl
"As long as we’re gonna be ran as a money machine, not as a football club? No chance",Spurs,Yes,jalqxb8,t1_jalpj7f
I'd take that tbf.,Spurs,Yes,jamzg0r,t1_jamyf05
And what about the previous years we haven’t got it over the line? This endless cycle of managers and lack of ambition that infects our club/fan base needs to end first.,Spurs,Yes,jam670a,t1_jalvkzd
"thats why i dont mind city. I geniunely enjoyed it when they were on top of the league. Now that Arsenal and Utd are gonna be alternating between titles, its going to be rough. Woolwich fans and Utd back to talking shit is not what I'm here for lol. at least it isnt chelsea.",Spurs,Yes,jamjra0,t1_jamd2ug
Champions League pays our bills. Plus you think we’re recruiting a player like Romero because we came in 8th but won the FA Cup? Please.,Spurs,Yes,janrogy,t1_jann5ee
"There shouldnt be a choice tho,  never winnjng ucl if u cant winfa",Spurs,Yes,jano53e,t1_jann5ee
Your taking a tiny chance of fluking our way to a final over winning the best cup competition in the world that we have a great history in?,Spurs,Yes,jao8ioz,t1_jann5ee
Not even sure if we can win next week against Milan,Spurs,Yes,jalhbeg,t1_jalgfz2
"Maignan is back, prepare for the worst.",Spurs,Yes,jalhik9,t1_jalgfz2
Milan is playing at their best recently,Spurs,Yes,jaljsvb,t1_jalgfz2
Get him fucking out of here. Bring home Poch. I want to feel something about the club again. I hate that we have a manager who thinks he's too good for us. I know we're shit but need we keep being reminded?,Spurs,Yes,jalqxz5,t1_jalov1n
The number of times you’ve been corrected on the spelling of Hitchen has to be in the tens of millions by this point,Spurs,Yes,jamnn98,t1_jamkfjr
Tbf Davidson was really good at Ajax. Hindsight is 20/20 but we all thought he was the chosen one to follow in the footsteps of Jan and Toby,Spurs,Yes,jammu37,t1_jamkfjr
Porro can perfectly play as a offensive full back in back four,Spurs,Yes,jant8ce,t1_jann1rt
"I agree, but it isn't even just that we might sack Conte - his contract is out at the end of the season so it isn't just not *firing* him but actually convincing him to *stay* that we need to do for our recent moves to look sensible financially.",Spurs,Yes,janpmpf,t1_jann1rt
Didn't Poch have his best season with us playing with wingbacks?,Spurs,Yes,janqiu5,t1_jann1rt
">with the first two (and Spence) only being able to play as wingbacks

strange, because they have both played quite a bit as FBs before",Spurs,Yes,janzle5,t1_jann1rt
I’m sure they’ll look good in a back 4 that doesn’t consist of Eric Dier or Davinson Sanchez but I doubt we sign anyone to replace them.,Spurs,Yes,janyse8,t1_jann1rt
"It's how it is after every loss now and it bums me the fuck out. Yes it sucks that we're out of the cup AGAIN, but people have no nuance.",Spurs,Yes,jaoyd0e,t1_jaonasl
"Richies a flop so far no matter how you figure it. 655 minutes played, zero goals. I actually think he’s quality and misused by Contes shit system, but be that as it may, he’s a flop (so far).",Spurs,Yes,jap1uvy,t1_jaonasl
"""this club is shit, why do you guys have high standards?""

No wonder we're a fucking joke",Spurs,Yes,jap2kzf,t1_jaonasl
Our individual records are fantastic it's depressing.,Spurs,Yes,jalgj46,t1_jalg9yx
"Pretty depressing if you view our club through the lens of opposition fans.

Seems like people here want to win a trophy for others and not for our own happiness.",Spurs,Yes,jalhrm9,t1_jalg9yx
Definitely on the players..just loser mentality..no other way around it,Spurs,Yes,jamcjk2,t1_jam508w
"I've said this but keep getting hammered for it. I just think the culture at the club just doesn't value the cups. 

The whole focus of the squad this last 2 weeks will have been the Chelsea and west ham games and then Milan. 

I just feel like for the fans we all saw the FA cup as a really good chance this year. Whereas the club players and manager do care about it, but there was no focus on it at all and it was a bit of an afterthought.",Spurs,Yes,jan11cw,t1_jamzr21
Yesterday showed that Conte is only concerned with the league.  Cup football is suited to our defend and break/set piece game. It’s about passion and creating opportunities. We don’t have a player that can turn a game or a system that allows such a player to flourish. Sheffield deserved the win because they wanted it two times as much. If we’d matched their passion we would have would through quality.,Spurs,Yes,jaljm26,t1_jalipup
"Yeah this sub is definitely not very enjoyable anymore. One positive for me is that earlier in the season I started blocking people who were just being needlessly negative or posting such awful takes it’s hard to tell if they’re trolling or not. 

I don’t mind having a different opinion to others here, in fact it’s been one of the best things about this sub, being able to have solid and sensible debates about things. But now it just seems pretty much impossible when the majority of takes are just overly negative and the people posting them don’t want to hear any other viewpoints.",Spurs,Yes,jalpbri,t1_jalmp0l
"There are too many ""new"" fans here especially from overseas during the pandemic, when Premier League was broadcast into many new lockdown homes.

But even for the older traditional based UK fans like me, it has been a depressingly long period of no silverware. And to go out of the FA Cup again in such a despicable manner is not acceptable from this club. When we last won the FA Cup in 1991 we were the historical top winners of the competition with 8 wins - now it's still 8 wins more than 30 years later! (Same as Liverpool and Chelsea btw) .

I'd prefer the FA Cup than top 4 - problem is, the management and many new fans don't want that, top 4 is the priority.

It doesn't help that likes of Arsenal are doing well again either, I think if we lose/draw to Wolves and/or Milan it may be the tipping point for some ie if you think it's bad now wait until next week (fingers crossed we actually win both games)",Spurs,Yes,jalnils,t1_jalmp0l
"Mate we've just got beaten by a championship sides reserve team. The FA cup is wode open and our best chance of winning a decent trophy in ages. It's nit just a one off game it's the whole approach and mindset. 

Throw in the fact that lingterm we have no idea who our manager will be past the summer and there's a good chance our greatest ever player will leave....precisely to win trophies like the one we threw last night. 

People being annoyed at that isn't doomsaying. It's a very frustrating situation at the moment.",Spurs,Yes,jalwrkw,t1_jalmp0l
I feel the same way. Cant think of many games this season ive enjoyed from 1 to 90 all season and I hate the slow and lethargic play when we are clearly capable of better. Not pining for poch but since he left I think its proved that style of play means alot more espcially when I look at how Woolwich and United are playing rn and look like winning everygame,Spurs,Yes,jali3bi,t1_jalgnip
"We are so so back. More than you believe

Liverpool have Man U (H) as well 🤑",Spurs,Yes,jaluuqs,t1_jaludyz
No,Spurs,Yes,jap39oj,t1_jaojos2
God I hope so,Spurs,Yes,jaoye3y,t1_jaojos2
Because apparently no targets are “available” during summer.,Spurs,Yes,jalbhmc,t1_jalb8t1
KMJ + Kvara would have cost less than what we paid for Richarlison,Spurs,Yes,jalcopp,t1_jalb8t1
"Because our lack of a real backup for Harry has been a major talking point since about 2016.

Do people not remember the years and years of bringing in players for one season then selling/loaning them? Was incredibly annoying!",Spurs,Yes,jam7605,t1_jalb8t1
At home as well. Fuck this team.,Spurs,Yes,jao94gq,t1_janlm7s
"We gave conte exactly what he wanted. Put perishit on 190k a week for God's sake. It's one thing going on about how a bad worksman blames his tools, but conte bloody handpicked his tools and still whinges that they're not the right ones.

His negative attitude, his negative tactics, his negative interviews, I'm done. I don't want this at the club I love anymore. How far we've fallen after losing poch I cannot overstate. At least I used to enjoy watching us play back then.",Spurs,Yes,jam0g5l,t1_jalzqji
Don't know whether to laugh or cry,Spurs,Yes,jalr50b,t1_jalr32f
Davies too,Spurs,Yes,jamzape,t1_jalr32f
"Yeah that's exactly how I feel. 

Throw in as well that Contes probably off and we don't even have the ""oh well at least we are developing together as a team"" to make it feel like progress.

Just feels like we are sort of sleep walking to 4th (if we di manage it) not much to get too pumped about or invested in.",Spurs,Yes,jan0au3,t1_jamyw58
"What part did Levy play last night?  Did he miss a sitter?  Did he fail to perform against a Championship side?  Did he fail to save a shot which was almost straight at him?  Did he fail to change the system when it was clear it wasn't working?  Did he continually cross the ball despite never finding a teammate?

I would like to know why it is Levy's fault when we played 14 internationals and an U21 and have basically the most expensive management team in world football.",Spurs,Yes,jamnlp7,t1_jamlxo5
">Why can’t we do both

2017 doesn't count?",Spurs,Yes,jaogjxl,t1_jaof8n8
"How much money do the owners take out of the club?  Glazers have literally taken £1.6bn out of United, ENIC have taken Levy's salary, which he works for.  That's it.

There is a calibre of fan which just cannot comprehend how we operate and what they are actually asking for.  We have a stark choice:  dubious billionaire owner, state owner or something very similar to what we have now.

It is better the devil you know in my book and the bigger the club becomes the more we can spend on the football.  Make no mistake, ENIC's work will not be done and their valuation will not be reached until there is on-field success.",Spurs,Yes,jamohey,t1_jamcvbn
Poor. Played matador defense on the goal and looked useless in possession,Spurs,Yes,jamccza,t1_jalx7hy

Why aren't all the other clubs that have been above Arsenal for years winning the league?  They're so unserious.

"I'd love to see how redknapp would have this team play, not necessarily be a long term manager but it would be interesting to see the tactics",Spurs,Yes,jalh9lk,t1_jalgntm

Conte's wikipedia doesn't mention any trophies, just has prize money season by season.",Spurs,Yes,jamon31,t1_jamc0hr
Why does it matter what Levy's priority is? It's not like he's the one selecting the team and telling them not to try in the FA cup because it isn't the main priority,Spurs,Yes,jamho5y,t1_jamc0hr

"Why wouldn't you be a doomer right now? What gives you optimism? Conte? Levy? the squad? champions league? top 4?

Levy is not Farhad Mohsiri. And we don't want Mohsiri or likewise to own us.,Spurs,Yes,jao7cw6,t1_jan4560
"Aside from a sovereign state slush fund, I'm curious how people think a new owner will magically make it better.

We have a self-sustaining model that is going to keep putting more money into the footballing side and we're run by a legitimate Tottenham supporter.

"Dier does not deserve blame for last game but the number of mistakes he has made this season leaves me wanting a successor regardless.

Perisic has been quite poor but it’s partially due to playing him so much especially since Sessegnon is so unreliable. Perisic played deep into the world cup and is 34.",Spurs,Yes,jaopbb9,t1_janu0nl
"Dier is. He isnt to blame for yest but he def isnt good enough to be a starter for top 6 either. Nut again, he was good yest. Perisic, tho, deserves all the shit. He is terrible.",Spurs,Yes,janvm2u,t1_janu0nl
"Dier isn’t suddenly a shit player. He’s always been shit.

You can’t blame the ‘system’ on Dier making the same braindead, baffling mistakes that put us in danger almost every other game. That’s always been part of his game. He’s been at the club 8 years it’s time to go.

You're on here everyday with one hot take after the other as to which world class player, manager, sporting director we should sign, all of your bullshit is predicated on the fact that we're a top club, how did that come to be, jackass?

Shitty recruitment for personnel, management, all true, annoying as fuck, infuriating. But without the context of where we are and how we got there? Go shit in the ocean you fucking crybaby.",Spurs,Yes,japiw4l,t1_jap2e2n

"If Son is leaving, its either to Liverpool, or the Bundesliga. I don't see him moving to a Serie A club especially Inter. Maybe he'd go to Roma if Jose stayed there but I don't think Jose will. Maybe La Liga teams might be interested.

"It's such a weird feeling. Last year in the same situation at least it felt like we were building towards something even with only top 4 to play for. This season not having anything to play for other than top 4 just feels like going through the motions. The only thing that would salvage some purpose for the remainder of the season would be Conte signing an extension or him being replaced.

Conte (and Mourinho) have won a trophy at EVERY club they've coached though...is it really the manager's fault at this point? There's a consistent mentality in the squad throughout multiple managers where they play arrogantly and with little effort against weaker competition and bottle it.",Spurs,Yes,janksp9,t1_jamqp14

Teams figuring us out is causing Sanchez to look like a toddler on the football pitch? Causing Hojbjerg to head the ball into the path of attacking players so they can have a free run at goal? Causing Davies to be unable to play simple passes and constantly giving the ball away?,Spurs,Yes,jalfa4l,t1_jalf3f8
"Simply not true. He played a number of good passes that led to dangerous situations and the one time he got to the byline he played a dangerous cutback. 

Would like to see him play with Kulusevski and Romero on that side.",Spurs,Yes,jam4dn3,t1_jam3d89
He didn’t pass the ball back whenever he had it lol he made some really good passes and had good interplay with the frontline. He wasn’t incredible but he was fine. Can’t expect him to defend effectively with Sanchez next to him.,Spurs,Yes,jam3kcv,t1_jam3d89

"Nah mate I'm a season ticket  holder and all my matchday going friends are probably even more annoyed than here. 

The problem is fans want a trophy and this fa cup was really open for us. However you can tell by the team selection and also just the players application that it's not a priority for them. 

That's what's annoying everyone so much I think. It's a sort of symbol of fans vs club and the differences in approach.",Spurs,Yes,jamcdpp,t1_jamauc4

Or - and stop me if I'm being absolutely crazy here - we continue to build the defence to challenge this summer?!

I can't fathom the ridiculousness of 'fans' suggesting we sell our greatest ever goal scorer, one-man club and heartbeat of the team because they don't like the manager with the second-most points per game in the entire history of Tottenham Hotspur.

"The footballs horrible and we seem to be getting worse despite giving him lots of the players he wants. He's making good players like son Richi and Bissouma much worse. 

There's loads if manager choices. Poch is a nailed on option who would come in a heartbeat. Why wouldn't Enrique come in? Potter will probably be available too. De Zerbi at Brighton has a 10m release clause. 

I don't really think arbitrarily deciding no other managers woukd be interested in the job I really a good enough reason to stick with Conte.",Spurs,Yes,jalmrqe,t1_jalm4f0
"When your senior players have become synonymous with years of failure you won't win anything unless those players are got rid of.

It's not even just about their quality it's about a mentality that has become part of who they are and poisons the whole squad.  They are used to losing, they are used to this type of thing. We have seen that same game play out many times. It happened under Poch, Mourinho and now Conte. 

There is massive value in having leaders who are winners on the pitch. Look at the difference Casemiro, Varane and Martinez have made for Man Utd. Even Zinchenko and Jesus have had a similar effect at Arsenal. These types of players raise standards and levels. 

While our senior players/leaders are Dier, Davies, Hojbjerg and Sanchez we aren't winning anything,",Spurs,Yes,jalojia,t1_jalnjx2
"You aren't wrong Vertonghen and Lloris went this way.

"Can we even sell Son right now for 35m? He is on HORRIFIC form ffs. It's just like Eriksen before he moved to Inter. I'm personally hoping we can get Sonny back in form (with a new system) and then we can try to sell him for 35m or higher. 

It really pains me, and I get you wanting to be pragmatic, but I'm not sure Sonny can be sold for that amount. Sadio frickin Mane on great form last season was sold for 40 million to Bayern, we won't get too much money for him. The smart idea is to try to get Sonny playing better in a new system and then selling high on him (when he has his purple patch) in January or whatever next season. Thats all we can really do. Selling Sonny on a 5 million or 10 million deal won't really do this squad any good tbh.",Spurs,Yes,jam9yea,t1_jalnjx2
"Do you really think Levy would give up Son? I don't know how much money he brings in, but if Levy sees Son as a cash cow, then I'll doubt he'll sell him, which is what I think Son needs, new pastures",Spurs,Yes,jam4213,t1_jalnjx2

"We're down a goal, we don't have a great chance to progress. Even if we somehow do, it's not like we'd go much further anyways. Meanwhile if the coaching staff and players took this game seriously, we would have drawn Blackburn in the next round and potentially have had an extremely easy path to the final. The league is whatever, the club only cares about top 4 anyways just to rinse and repeat for next season, except next time we won't have Kane and we won't have Conte",Spurs,Yes,jalm1n9,t1_jall3u8
who would you bring in as the interim manager? Even Chelsea haven't sacked potter yet.,Spurs,Yes,jamp94h,t1_jamoydy
"Poor like the rest of the squad but had glimpses of being the guy we bought. He did this really really nice pass across the pitch right onto a running Son that I have only seen Kane do for us recently.

"Had some good moments, like beating his man (yes I am not joking this was a notable moment for me), and some good movement and like one good cross. Definitely one of our most threatening attacking players which isn't the compliment you think it is.

"We absolutely will spend on a CB. The porro money was for Jan. The only reason it was pushed to the summer was because Sporting Lisbon asked us to for accounting.

"I think he was a bright spot, but he wasn't effective. Compare what happens when Moura dribbles the ball past players and when Deki does it. With Deki he takes the ball to dangerous areas and we know he can link up or cross or shoot. Moura rarely manages any of that.",Spurs,Yes,jalnl84,t1_jalgf1j
"I'm saying they were hardly put in positions to create chances considering how long it takes us to shift the ball up the pitch sometimes with the aimless passing from side to side 

Son also being played centrally and so much deeper than Perisic is a crime",Spurs,Yes,jalif40,t1_jalh8rp
"It is incredibly painful. 

I'm not sure even with a creator on the left and if Perisic returns to his form last season we would actually be any better, we play such slow football but with little purpose in so many passes before playing direct.

"Does Conte even want to be here is the question.He hasn't signed a new contract which suggests that he really doesn't want to be here.

This club needs a complete rebuild in various areas.Our youth academy is simply not good enough  I haven't seen many players progress through the academy to the first team.The second issue is our spending in this inflated market you either have to have an excellent scouting department that are able to find the hidden gems or you need to spend heavily at least upwards of 200 mill.We don't have a good scouting department and we also don't spend big.The third issue is the actual vision and ambition of the club do they simply want top 4 or do they actually want to win trophies because I don't see any effort being made to show that we are aiming to win trophies.


I feel like next transfer window is going to be mess.Paratici still going through the juve case which leaves the club in uncertainty .It looks like Conte isn't going to be here next season.We have a squad is too big with all the players on loan coming back and so we will need to offload alot of these players.The team needs alot improvements such as a new gk, wingers and defenders.",Spurs,Yes,jameqdk,t1_jam670a
This is where I’m at. I really don’t believe getting rid of the manager actually solves anything. The problems have persisted for years now and several managers. Projects take time to develop.,Spurs,Yes,jamc681,t1_jam670a
"Yeah I’ve always been the same, couldn’t care less about the oil and gangster clubs because in my twisted mind none of their trophies ever counted anyway, and like you said it held the previous super clubs at bay.

And tbh they all brought it on themselves with the money introduced through the PL and the CL, there really wasn’t a road to success without the influx of money from the outside after that.

It’s gutting that we’re one of the few clubs who’ve tried to do it the proper way and likely will have nothing to show for it.",Spurs,Yes,jamkfeg,t1_jamjra0
Why do we suddenly go 8th if we actually compete for a cup? Why is it always one or the other. And beating fucking Sheffield United should not be the factor determining which outcome we have,Spurs,Yes,jaode8z,t1_janrogy
Champions league money is a drop in the bucket compared to all the Disney lane shit at the stadium now. That’s where the real revenue comes from,Spurs,Yes,jant58v,t1_janrogy
We got Romero playing conference league under Nuno. Anyone who says they’d take years of getting knocked out of CL just for the minuscule chance we might fluke our way to another final can’t be serious.,Spurs,Yes,jao714j,t1_janrogy
honestly tho we typically play better vs teams at their best rather than teams struggling. It's the Tottenham way,Spurs,Yes,jalk8nu,t1_jaljsvb
I agree that he's nos responsible for having to start dier and co but not being able to score 1 goal against a championship team with all these attacking players ? Shameful. At least we scored goals under poch,Spurs,Yes,jalr1te,t1_jalqxz5
"Respectfully, why do you care? I'll call Hitchens chicken if I want. Deal with it.",Spurs,Yes,jamnv82,t1_jamnn98
Was he?  He was totally exposed by Mourinho and he was only at Ajax a year.,Spurs,Yes,jamnps7,t1_jammu37
"seriously, it is after every loss everyone thinks the sky is falling. two wins in a row and you'd think we were about to win the league",Spurs,Yes,jap5eat,t1_jaoyd0e
"we're a joke because every time we implode everyone throws a massive fit. 

plenty of clubs do far worse than us and their supporters don't absolute melt down and look like clowns.",Spurs,Yes,jap5avb,t1_jap2kzf
"😂 trust me I want a trophy for my own happiness. I don’t care what other fans say, I’m just commenting that if it were the other way round we would do what they’re doing.",Spurs,Yes,jali32i,t1_jalhrm9
"That’s not anything new, Pochettino admitted it himself that Levy only wants Top 4 or a PL/European title and that those were his sole objectives as manager.",Spurs,Yes,jan447v,t1_jan11cw
The culture of the club doesn’t value winning,Spurs,Yes,jan1abr,t1_jan11cw
"In truth, Conte is a terrible Cup manager.",Spurs,Yes,jalke7a,t1_jaljm26
"Couldn’t agree more about the new fans thing. I honestly don’t mind the fan base expanding, it’s pretty much only a good thing. However it’s so easy to tell when someone has only been following us since Poch most of the time. 

They’re an easy target and it is lazy to blame them, but here and on r/soccer you really can spot Americans a mile off. It’s not all American fans obviously and people post shit takes from all over the world, UK included, but I really think a lot of the negativity is coming from people who have much less of a connection to the club than others and who don’t appreciate how far we’ve actually come. 

I’m fuming at the FA cup exit too, and Arsenal looking like they’re going to win the league makes me sick, but people posting constant negativity and posts such as the one last night saying we should remove ourselves from the big 6 just don’t help anything.",Spurs,Yes,jalps2e,t1_jalnils
"Sure, but I was heavily downvoted in the post match thread for saying I was optimistic we'd get Top 4 and beat Milan in the second leg. Meanwhile comments calling our players ""arrogant cunts"" get upvoted. Hard not to notice that.",Spurs,Yes,jancpon,t1_jalwrkw
"> what we *paid* for Richarlison

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*",Spurs,Yes,jalcp9l,t1_jalcopp
He probably won't be here next season which tells you something.He acted like he was in it for the long run by saying we need patience and that it takes a few seasons to be title contenders. I haven't seen any improvement to suggest that infact I feel like we have gotten worse.Conte not signing a new contract just shows that he simply doesn't care and was only in it for the money.,Spurs,Yes,jamavjk,t1_jam0g5l
I don't like Conte or his football but I don' see how you could possibly know he got exactly what he wanted.,Spurs,Yes,jam0mpz,t1_jam0g5l
"its Levy's fault  that he sacked Jose the game before the cup final. Its levy's fault that we had a whole summer transfer window under Peak Pochettino era where we didn't get him a SINGLE signing. Its Levy's fault, we didn't try to rebuild from the start but continue on this delusion that the current squad is good enough to win trophies. 

&#x200B;

Now obviously, not everything is Levy's fault, but he definitely deserves blame.",Spurs,Yes,jamol1n,t1_jamnlp7
"I agree that the team out there was 100% capable of winning that game and should have done. However, we’ve been knocked out by some drab teams in recent history, and we’ve had Dier, Sanchez, Davies and the likes that have let us down. Instead of seeing they simply won’t get us through these games and selling them for a loss and finding someone who can get us through, he offers them new contracts. That’s why Daniel levy and the board have massively let down this fan base, not actually building a squad that’s capable of achieving anything, year in, year out, except maybe get top 4 (with the help of other teams being shit). 

Not good enough from the top to the bottom, this club is hopeless and there needs to be massive changes from recruiting and spending to putting on the right fucking studs on your boots so you don’t slip for no reason at all.",Spurs,Yes,jampeb2,t1_jamnlp7
Splattergun blame Levy for the consequences of his actions challenge (impossible),Spurs,Yes,jan128f,t1_jamnlp7
6 years ago?,Spurs,Yes,jaogozc,t1_jaogjxl
"You should probably change your flair if this your stance. I agree the devil we know is better than the one we don’t, but don’t say you want ENIC and levy out if you actually want them in",Spurs,Yes,jamq4no,t1_jamohey
"They actually have been building on what they had previously, we have gotten worse since Poch left.

Do you understand why people are frustrated? Jesus",Spurs,Yes,jan0ssl,t1_jamuar6
"Yeah but you could tell by the application the players weren't really arsed either. I think its just the whole mindset is ""I'd we win tonight great if we don't oh well we got bigger battles""

Whereas for the fans now we'd probably rather we targeted this cup over UCL. Whereas players staff and club dont",Spurs,Yes,jamjh3q,t1_jamfda4
we’ve known for years that when we rotate we shit the bed. The players we rotated in years ago are still here so us having issues isn’t new information,Spurs,Yes,jamiu3y,t1_jamfda4
"Yep that's exactly what I said. A great argument. 

Noone said that the players lost on purpose did they. But anyone with eyes could see they were completely unmotivated.....as they were last year in....yep you guessed it...the exact same competition in the exact same round against a team in the exact same lower league.",Spurs,Yes,jamp30b,t1_jamon31
"I don't understand derstand what you mean. I don't think the FA cup is anyone's priority other than the fans. 

The players and coaches all get paid more in bonuses and ucl wins etc, and just generally I think they all get more pumped for Milan than Sheffield United at Bramhall Lane.",Spurs,Yes,jamj80z,t1_jamho5y
Can you provide an email address to which I can send full-match replays of our last 10 cup exits?,Spurs,Yes,jalt3ce,t1_jalsw5t
A man can dream,Spurs,Yes,jam3msk,t1_jam2pah
"Been watching this club too long to care too much tbh, what will happen will happen, not really worth it for me to get too upset or too giddy either way",Spurs,Yes,jamojjq,t1_jamo9ax
I don't think he's in the market,Spurs,Yes,jaodksj,t1_jao7cw6
Owner that prioritizes football,Spurs,Yes,janjfvu,t1_janfhqq
"Mate the entire prem is stinking fucking rich, it's not hard to make absolute fucking shitloads of money in the prem

What is unique is ownership that actually cares about the football results vs. fucking go karts and bungee jumps

You'd think they'd be bothered by 20 years of no success but money is the only thing that matters to them",Spurs,Yes,janw627,t1_janfhqq
"Why would a dumb spend happy non state affiliated billionaire be either impossible to achieve or worse than the current situation? I'll buy into this amazing sustainable model when I see it bearing fruit, because it's been a significant time of the club pushing in a more commercial direction just as the football has been suffering. Spurs is already long past the point of being this cuddly homegrown fan focused club, so might as well get some success if that's the case",Spurs,Yes,jantlbt,t1_janfhqq
"Agreed, it's almost like we should have kept Doherty for when Sess is out...",Spurs,Yes,jao8kzt,t1_jao8fnl
"Fair enough about Dier, I love the guy but he does need an upgrade. Agree about Perisic, I think as fit as he is he's another year older than last year and that counts against him unfortunately.",Spurs,Yes,jaovp5a,t1_jaopbb9
It's Perisic's fault because the system dictates their positioning.,Spurs,Yes,januso5,t1_janublp
Yeah I’m fine with Sonny coming off the bench and Richy starting. I think we’ve found a good combo for now. Maybe we find our own Garnacho…,Spurs,Yes,janv4w7,t1_januy6u
Ok what about £40m then?,Spurs,Yes,jant2ux,t1_janszx4
You can't have a functioning attack unless the whole team is functioning properly. Attack and defence are not separate in football. If you can't sustain attacks and pressure on a team you will not create anything meaningful. If the defence is constantly giving the ball away and unable to beat a press you never put your attackers in good enough positions to be useful.,Spurs,Yes,jalf0tp,t1_jalekmi
">But without the context of where we are and how we got there?

Thanks Levy

ok now what, is he all of a sudden good at picking managers?",Spurs,Yes,japmdjt,t1_japiw4l
"Why are you getting downvoted? this time 2 years ago he was reported as being second to Woodward in salary who has since resigned and Levy himself has had a pay rise since then.

Admittedly I’m not sure where Newcastle and Chelsea sit as they’ve had takeovers but he is almost definitely in the top 3.  Not weighing in on the Levy in/out thing but it’s mad how you’re stating something factual and getting downvoted for it",Spurs,Yes,jannsq2,t1_jan1ekq
31 year old with 2 years left. They can afford him,Spurs,Yes,jam2jo4,t1_jam2e9p
"Right forgot about all of the loans. These will be their next destinations

Sergio Reguilon - Girona

Harry Winks - Fulham

Bryan Gil - Sevilla

Joe Rodon - Burnley

Giovani Lo Celso - Villarreal

Tanguy Ndombele - Fenerbahce",Spurs,Yes,jam13hp,t1_jam016b
I love him as much as you do. But it’s time to be rational. It’s 7 months now,Spurs,Yes,jam50n8,t1_jam3sfy
He has a release clause of €45m,Spurs,Yes,jam43vp,t1_jam3zr9
I think it's because Arsenal and United have clearly made progress since last season when we looked the more likely to so so based on how the final table 21/22. Seeing them do so well right now is extra depressing. This season really is extremely similar to Conte's last season with Chelsea even though they still won an FA cup ffs.,Spurs,Yes,janqvhx,t1_janksp9
"Yeah, now I feel like I jinxed them. My bad.",Spurs,Yes,jaod5lm,t1_jaoc3x6
"Yeah, I remember my Inter friends saying the same, but at least they had the luck of silverware I guess",Spurs,Yes,jalfzid,t1_jalfscx
"The football will be the same under an ""attacking manager"" as long as the players don't change.",Spurs,Yes,jalfwrj,t1_jalfscx
"They're not mutually exclusive. 

I suspect many of our players are very low on confidence and the tactics don't suit us",Spurs,Yes,jalhpd1,t1_jalfa4l
Both things can be true.,Spurs,Yes,jalhv10,t1_jalfa4l
Don't you think getting to the byline once in 82 minutes is a bit bad? Him and Romero and there's no chance at a clean sheet. Every time Romero would rush out Porro would be left alone and would get bounced by any winger in the league.,Spurs,Yes,jam53pc,t1_jam4dn3
He put in 3 crosses and I don't think even a single one connected.,Spurs,Yes,jam45gw,t1_jam3q3k
He also got bullied by Sheffield attackers.,Spurs,Yes,jam9xkt,t1_jam9apf
Yup thanks for the clarification 🤘🏽,Spurs,Yes,jarq8gm,t1_japyavs
"He doesn't though. You can see he doesn't slip he just loses balance. 

And its not like a one off thing he does it all the time. Someone put it on twotter but there's like a gallery of him just falling over unopposed about 5 or 6 times. 

He's clearly just got really bad balance.",Spurs,Yes,jam4dha,t1_jam3ema
"Maybe you need to give yourself a few slappings  if you think this squad is anywhere near challenging for anything just because we’ll add a new GK and CB in the summer. I’d rather sell Kane for 70+ and Son if we can get a decent fee and start building an actually strong squad. OP is absolutely right in the club trying to appease Kane by trying to shortcut their way to trophies. I want the old guard gone, that includes Kane and Son, rather do it now of our own accord and hopefully plan for it instead of it happening out of the club’s control (Kane leaving on a free next summer and age catching up to Son). 

We have waste the Kane&Son era, the sooner fans accept this the better. Now it’s time to move forward and get in a long term manager that plays on the front foot. I guarantee you that things will get worse before they get better, so better strap yourselves in.",Spurs,Yes,janj709,t1_janhwwt
"Potter literally rejected the job because he didn't want to ruin his reputation in a job where he won't get enough time before he joined Chelsea. Paratici somehow convincing Conte is the biggest mystery I have ever seen in my life. We are not that exciting of a prospect for upcoming or already world class managers. 

Add to that the fact that a lot of jobs might be open in the summer (Real, Bayern, Chelsea), we are not the bell of the ball we all consider ourselves.",Spurs,Yes,jalnhqf,t1_jalmrqe
"Very good point. We need more winners in the team, players that have played for clubs were there is constant pressure to perform. Bentancur was playing for Juventus since being a youngster and winning scudcettos, never goes missing and puts in consistently good performances, how many times has he been out MotM this season? I can think of maybe 2-3 actually bad performances since he’s been here. He knows what it takes to be a winner, so many of our players are fragile.",Spurs,Yes,jalp8ge,t1_jalojia
"I think Dele is a great example. I remember there were offers of around 80-90m, we ended up giving him away for free. I’m not implying that we should have sold him at his peak obviously, we should try to keep our best players. But once his drop off started and kept on going, we could have simply parted ways, we definitely could have gotten a good 30m for him at least, considering English tax. But no, Levy tried so hard to revive his career.

We are now wittinessing an almost 31 year old pacey winger have a complete drop off and looking a shadow of himself. The tactics and Persisic don’t help, but Son can’t control a football and beat a man for almost 3/4th of a whole season, you can’t claim that this is just a bad patch, none of us know that anymore considering how long this has been going on. Because of his WC quality over the past few years, there might be a team that takes a stab at him this summer and is willing to pay a decent sum considering his age, but it’s either this summer or never.",Spurs,Yes,jalotv7,t1_jalo6vv
"Yeah 100%

It's poor talent ID as well as poor manager selection. As a result we've been left with a squad full of 3 different managers players, and most were great for the manager who actually wanted them.

This idea we haven't spent is just completely wrong.",Spurs,Yes,jam4023,t1_jam3s93
Exceptions only prove the rule. You can’t claim a club that is serious about absorbing the costs needed to fix a problem keeps Eric Dier around for 9 years or buys djed Spence for Antonio conte,Spurs,Yes,jam4blk,t1_jam3s93
"yes I'm sure the only reason why he signed Davinson Sanchez, Ndombele, Sessegnon, Aurier and Lucas Moura were because Pochettino needed them in his squad. You know he still has to attempt to be a DOF right. If Hitchens does nots approve of making signings like Sanchez, Sessegnon and Ndombele then why would he sign them? The truth his Hitchens has no talent ID. it is what it is.",Spurs,Yes,jamummd,t1_jamtb0x
"Thinking about Ancelotti, I realized Everton's last 3 managers were all ex Chelsea. Kind of odd that.",Spurs,Yes,jap0boj,t1_jaozju9
Yes.,Spurs,Yes,japz2g9,t1_jaozju9
"Even with how he's got them playing? It's obviously not entirely his fault, that squad is way too big, but surely with the amount of talent they've got they should be a little better",Spurs,Yes,jap39z5,t1_jap2gin

Why? 7th too hopeful?,Spurs,Yes,jaohl0p,t1_jao99vr
"Football is bad today cause we rested Kulu, Kane and Romero. We’ve had our best 3 wins of the season recently (City, West Ham, Chelsea). Yeah we prob won’t win a trophy but we’re def not as bad as some people think",Spurs,Yes,jalmlup,t1_jalm9qc
Poch all the way.,Spurs,Yes,jampc6c,t1_jamp94h

Hakimi would look poor next to tanganga/romero,Spurs,Yes,janq13f,t1_janfosx
Good point. Would be good to see that tbf,Spurs,Yes,jan9rdv,t1_jan4epz
Yet if they were 2 brilliant matches we’d be judging him as the next big thing… so it can work both ways. But yes I’ll give it a few more games. Annoying that it was his defending that caused the goal though,Spurs,Yes,jao44y6,t1_janbmh7
"Prepare to get down voted for calling out the truths on the players. Just look at the amount of downvotes I’m getting… yet we will see at the end of the season

It'll work this time!,Spurs,Yes,janlqhs,t1_janjeas
You could say the same thing about the FA cup. We could have lost to City or United in the semis or final. But weve made a CL final not too long ago and despite losing we gave ourselves a chance to win one of the biggest prizes. I think we have the possibility to win it especially this year as it seems a lot of top teams are a bit off. If we crash out against Milan then obviously this will make the FA cup loss look way worse.,Spurs,Yes,jan6xsg,t1_jan04zy
"Completely agree. 

Been a fan 29 years and it's just so stale now and not even the fun ups and downs of supporting a club.",Spurs,Yes,jan33oq,t1_jan0h5i
"Big chances is a specific stat with a specific definition. The PEH giveaway was a big chance for Sheffield—it’s basically a “you are expected to score from here” metric.

We had 17 shots. Those are lower case c chances. We had plenty of final third entries. Those are lower case c chances. We had plenty of set pieces around the area. Those are lower case c chances. I’m thinking of Lucas’ cross/shot, Richy’s dipping shot that hit the post, Kane’s header near the end of the game, Perisic’s header from Son’s corner, etc.",Spurs,Yes,jam58ga,t1_jam3ufg
"He literally was our best player. I do think get this thing that when there's more than enough bad performance then people try and push it on to a player theu don't like.

My bigger concern is if we don’t finish in a champions league spot one of the clauses in Kulusevski contract is that we finish in a CL spot for us to sign him. If we don’t get him - I think another club in the Prem will snap him up as he’s that good (thinking Man U or maybe Newcastle). That would be a big blow to us",Spurs,Yes,jan48tz,t1_jan3jkx
"I want him to stay. Get that summer where he gets backed to the fullest and then the fanbase can see why Conte is so reputed

The thing with him is he needs every single position to be perfect which is why he’s called a chequebook manager but we knew this already when we hired him

There are a good 5-6 positions we should upgrade on in GK, CB, LCB, LWB, LW at the very least and get depth in RCB, RW and CM. If we reinforce these positions this summer then we’d have insane success

I want to see one manager backed to the hilt before we give up on him. If we get in Poch, I’m 100% sure he’d do a good job and get backed way better than before but currently we’re just one solid window or two away from greatness under Conte",Spurs,Yes,janrk1y,t1_jan3jkx

Exactly! Maybe Dier and Sanchez are shit. Maybe we should cancel their contracts today and send them off to Leyton Orient or something. But we didn't lose 5-3. We just couldn't score a goal against a team not even in our league. Why cant our expensively assembled front line not score a goal? Why does Kane (surely he leaves now!) have to do everything week after week.,Spurs,Yes,jaltj6a,t1_jalr1te
Did I say I care? It’s funny to me to see you incapable of learning,Spurs,Yes,jamobch,t1_jamnv82
I agree. He was overrated at Ajax. He looked the same as KMJ did in the Chinese league. KMJ only started actually looking really good in Fenerbahce. the difference was KMJ was always good on the ball even in China. KMJ was a beast in the korean league though.,Spurs,Yes,jamoqst,t1_jamnps7
"This place and I think sports fandom in general is emotional whiplash. I was so happy on Monday and then yesterday I was just bummed. I don't even really care about this weekend's game tbh, just want to see a good performance and win against Milan.",Spurs,Yes,jap67xr,t1_jap5eat

"Agreed. He’s a grind it out week in week out manager.  Tbf he’ll most likely get us top 4 again and that is a significant achievement despite the criticism. But like all of us, I’d love a trophy and the FA cup is an achievable target.",Spurs,Yes,jall55z,t1_jalke7a
Disagree I'd say some of the most negative fans I've encountered are long-term fans. 22 years of disappointment is a lot and there is only so much someone can take. I'd say it's quite the opposite the more positive and patient fans I've met on here and in IRL are the newer fans because they don't know what's happened over the last 20 or so years.,Spurs,Yes,jalteey,t1_jalps2e

"He didn't get everything that he wanted. But everyone that was paying attention during the transfer window can make the conclusion that he got the best that the club could realistically get.

We had a 60-70m offer for Lautaro accepted by Inter, only for them to back out of it in the end because they decided to sell Lukaku instead. Similar figure was accepted for Bastoni but he refused to leave Inter. Gvardiol didn't want to leave Leipzig either. It's clear that the money was there and the club was ready to splash big for Conte. He has ZERO ground to be upset for not being backed.

Nonetheless, all signings we made were met with positivity and it's unfathomable how pretty much all of them have been awful so far. The main responsibility for that for me falls on the manager.",Spurs,Yes,jam3afu,t1_jam0mpz
"Well perisic was clearly his signing. As was lenglet who he also tried to sign at Inter and talks up all the time. 

Richi the word was it was apparantly also his signing. And logically it checks out given I can't see Levy jumping to spend 60m on a rotation option. 

Only question marks is bissouma. Spence obviously wasn't.",Spurs,Yes,jam2fix,t1_jam0mpz
Oh fucking yawn.  Instead of just pissing your pants why don't you tell us exactly what should have been done?,Spurs,Yes,jaql0sc,t1_jan128f

"Of course I do, I have been watching Spurs since 1988 and been to hundreds of games.  I feel it as acutely as anybody.

That said I don't let go of all rationality every time there is a bad result.  

We certainly are not worse than when Poch left as we were in freefall.  Mistakes have been made before and after that, but we have not been finished 8th like Arsenal either.  

You have to look at things over time, ie not 1-2 seasons, and clearly we have elevated our level significantly.  What is now required is some consistent strategy between recruitment and team management.  The board seem to be getting pilloried for having employed Mourinho and Conte, two of the most successful managers in the world and both PL winners, and for making signings at the level our club can currently afford.

Our biggest issue is the mistakes made in recruitment between 2017 and 2020.  We are still recovering and we will still be recovering even after this summer.  The reason the likes of Sanchez are still with us is because so many of our signings since became deadwood and have a massive ongoing cost.  We can't turn back time on that so we need to ride it out.

That said I don't believe we have the right manager, I hate the tactics, the performances and the dysfunctional attack.  We are putting together a good young squad and I can't see him being the guy to bring them through.",Spurs,Yes,janbbqt,t1_jan0ssl
"Again, I'm not sure what priority has anything to do with anything.

It definitely wasn't Man City's priority to win the Carabao cup every season yet they did it.

We looked pretty rough in the UCL matches too though.,Spurs,Yes,jamtdux,t1_jamj80z
"No need. I’ve seen them all

The truth is that we don’t have the depth to win these competitions. This time of year when the cups are decided, we are always in a race for top 4 and so it’s natural that we play rotated teams. And our rotated teams are far inferior than Liverpool’s, City’s, Chelsea’s etc",Spurs,No,jaltvtp,t1_jalt3ce
"Aye, I feel like anyone surprised or upset by our B team bombing out of the FA cup against lower league opposition hasn't supported us long enough to be immune to it yet, or just allows the hope to kill them. 

Whole thing just feels like ""meh"" to me. Briefly disappointed but not surprised. We needed to rotate and our rotation teams never get enough playtime to be match-sharp or develop a good understanding. 

If we can make top 4 and go into next season with the new signings properly bedded in (which takes a long time, plenty of players and managers put it at 12-18 months), I'll be happy.",Spurs,Yes,jamwjps,t1_jamojjq
"fair enough. I think I would feel much better if this club was going in a rebuild situation. I'd have much lower expectations if we went under a rebuilding manager and sold Kane and sold Son and just tried to build from the ground up again. That was enjoyable. I just hate wasting Kane and Son at this club man. Yes they have problems themselves, but they should be given more chances to play in cup finals. We shouldn't have to start Kane against Sheffield man if we are a good side.

"On a personal opinion side, I'm not sure we don't have that now, we just haven't been successful at it.

Aside from that, again, without the new owners being a magic sportwashing slush fund, the overwhelming likelihood of any new owner is investment fund with less personal ties to the club than ENIC and Levy. New owner's aren't magically plunking down billions with no regard for the investment.

You can say ""owner that prioritizes football"" til you're blue in the face, but where's the queue of them?",Spurs,Yes,janlapr,t1_janjfvu

"Who gives a fuck at all about F1 or bungee jumping? I said absolutely nothing about them. Either you genuinely think that the people involved in the F1 deal or bungee jumping were neglecting football related duties to get those things done, and you're being silly, or you know they're separate activities and you're just being disingenuous. 

Should Levy be out of making football decisions, or should he be focused on football decisions? Which is it? Because we don't like when he's involved, and when he does other things (that pump money into the football) we wield them as criticisms.

Are we trying to make sense, or just trying to have something to point fingers at? Do you think City doesn't have commercial revenue? Madrid? Bayern? Barca? Arsenal? Liverpool? No, you don't think that because of fucking course they do. 

None of this has anything to do with our lack of success on the pitch, and it's such a transparently bullshit argument. I don't even like go karts or bungee jumping, or give a fuck what our commercial revenue is, it's just so incredibly stupid to be mad at it and scapegoat it.",Spurs,Yes,jao7wq9,t1_janw627

"True, but they were both lucky to be amongst the top teams back when the PL and CL was formed, thus benefiting more than others from those money injections. 

After that there really has only been one way to achieve success. It’s the same across all European countries and it’s boring. We see the same teams from the same leagues competing at the top year in year out and it’s been like this for 3 decades.

I’m old enough to remember the time before that and it was a lot more fun to watch domestic and European competitions.

We are only getting top four cause Liverpool and Chelsea fucked up. Next season if Conte plays the same grind, we will be battered like we usually are. Conte tbf has proved that despite his past success, managers have evolved and teams that are much more dynamic   tend to win the most. Even the few tactical masterclasses this season have been when Conte was out in Italy. Personally I think Conte has been the worst tactician of the top teams this season. He got schooled by his compatriots Tuchel (we got lucky) and Arteta. And the same will happen with ETH.",Spurs,Yes,jalllc3,t1_jall55z

As someone who has been a fan for around 20 years, my personal view is that while the football and the results have been disappointing, where we are as a club compared to 20 years ago is far far better. We’ve gone from being potential relegation candidates to featuring in the champions league pretty regularly. 

It seems to me that many new fans want to compare our success against the likes of Man City, whereas a lot of older fans compare our success to how shit we really used to be.",Spurs,Yes,jaluaor,t1_jalteey
I'm not defending him or making him a victim. But I also think the narratives pushed about these transfers when they were happening clearly was misleading.

"I don't think any of that is obvious at all apart from Perisic. There's also a big difference between actively wanting a player to come and just accepting their arrival.

Not saying Conte is without any mistakes, but so will be any manager we replace him with. Everybody is looking for a perfect manager, without realising one doesn't exist.

In terms of stature over the last decade, upwards. Conte is not a manager who would've even looked at our direction five years ago. In terms of results, around the same. Looks like another 4-5th place finish this year. Next year I couldn't even make a prediction because of the Conte situation.

* They are forced to constantly leave players out of their squad because they have too many players .

* They sold their most experienced midfielder to sign a young kid with half a season in Europe who can't even speak english for 120m in January when the team was crying out for stability. 
* Their fans have been booing Cucurella, who is the most expensive full back in football history, and he couldn't even make the matchday squad against us.
* They left Aubameyang out of their UCL squad and multiple PL squads and have now brought him back.
* They left their shiny new CB out of the UCL squad and now their best CB is injured. 
* They paid 100m for a kid from Ukraine who has basically done nothing in his career and was begging for a transfer to Arsenal but has ended up at Chelsea and has looked totally off it. 
* The dressing room is a disaster for all the above reasons. I can't even begin to fathom how toxic it must be. 
* They have scored 6 goals in 5 months.

Also, Hojbjerg himself is probably naturally more of a DM himself, he's just asked to contribute more to the attack in this system. 

I think we should be targeting another B2B CM next who has good attacking output as well as being able to cover a lot of ground, pressing and having solid defensive traits.

Honestly I would rather us not finish top 4 than see side ways passing rest of the season.,Spurs,Yes,jak26f2,t1_jak0og9
"There isn’t any coach in world football that’s realistically available that has done what he’s done  

I remember all y’all nutting over Graham Potter as the perfect “project manager” and look how that’s going - for all the dickriding Ten Hag gets he’s only 4 points ahead with a squad that maybe two Spurs players would get into on a good day",Spurs,Yes,jak6jbf,t1_jak0og9
">but how to you explain us getting embarrassed by championship sides and bottom table PL clubs this season

I thought we always did this though",Spurs,Yes,jaknf35,t1_jak0og9
"Because if I look at the distribution of managers better than Conte and managers worse than Conte one side of the graph is bigger than the other.

For every Conte there a dozen Nuno’s. 

I’d rather stick with Conte too long than not long enough. 

And I don’t think it’s been long enough yet.",Spurs,Yes,jakauu0,t1_jak0og9
"Because the club needs a change, and this point the biggest change the club can do is give a world class manager time. Everyone in this sub wants us to be the next Liverpool, but are not willing to give the manager the time to make his team.

Add to that, why would a manager come to spurs after seeing that Antonio freaking Conte is getting sacked after about a year and a half.

If Conte leaves on his own, than I can certainly understand, but if not, there is no point in getting a new manager because even they won't get the time and the cycle will continue.",Spurs,Yes,jak9h7g,t1_jak0og9
"I don’t see how changing Conte fixes the underlying issues. It just puts a new mask on the same problems. I don’t necessarily think it’s the ownership either. There isn’t a winning culture in the club right now, and it hasn’t been in place since the CL final. We would find ourselves back in the same place two years (or less) from now if we got a new manager. We’ve seen the tactics work. We’ve seen great play out of this team. It’s much more complex than replacing the manager.",Spurs,Yes,jakjq3k,t1_jak0og9
"Yeah because it gives us results until it didnt. I expect to find courtesy within others so he lasts the season no matter what happens.

We can play all the beautiful football we want but we'll probably end up with the twilight of Pochs reign which to be honest wasnt that good results-wise either

See the big problem is the man upstairs and nobody seems to care because morality excuses and whatever hogwash",Spurs,Yes,jal4isg,t1_jak0og9
">  of which two aren’t even clear downgrades in Son and Sarr for Richarlison and Skipp/Hojbjerg. 

Porro for Emerson as well. This kind of match could suit him very well, playing against weaker opposition that will perhaps try to sit back.",Spurs,Yes,jagub2t,t1_jagqf3o
"Especially as one of the aces up our sleeve is fitness.  It's the back end of the season, other squads are tiring, but we are not.  That's one of the whole points of Conte's regime.  We shouldn't need to rotate to rest.",Spurs,Yes,jagx1q9,t1_jagqf3o
"> Didn’t we learn anything from Middlesbrough last year?

We played pretty close to full strength last year, with the only real change being Bentancur not even in the squad for some reason. 

Personally I think it’s unrealistic to expect us to go with anything but full strength against Wolves, I just can’t see Conte doing it, unless it’s to rest people for Milan. I do think he’ll go pretty strong tonight: I expect Kane to start, and most of our changes to ones that don’t drastically lower the quality, at least in his eyes. My main concern is that he gets that RHS wrong. I think it’s reasonably likely Porro starts, but I can definitely see Romero being benched, and Tanganga seems to have Been favoured over Sanchez recently, and I can’t see Tanganga and Porro not being a liability. However I think Royal and Sanchez or even Tanganga leaving us lacking on that side as well, so I just hope it’s either Royal Romero or Porro Romero/Sanchez.",Spurs,Yes,jagtsk0,t1_jagqf3o
"Yeah we should be in full force probably more than Wolves fixture, NO RAGRETS",Spurs,Yes,jagqnso,t1_jagqf3o
Yeah I agree. I think we could try Danjuma on the RW though to give Kulu a much needed rest.,Spurs,Yes,jagr8yk,t1_jagqf3o
I'm not even confident in Lloris' shot stopping ability these days. He literally gifted Arsenal two goals across both derbies and failed to stop Odegaard's shot across the ground which was saveable. Could have gotten something out of both games if not for Lloris' clangers. There's various other games where his shot stopping has failed us this season too.,Spurs,Yes,jahku30,t1_jaharhp
"Modric is that guy! He would be our Casemiro impact signing. We already have decent DMs in hojbjerg and Skipp and even Bissouma. I would love to get Modric. 

Pay him whatever he wants. Bring him HOME!",Spurs,Yes,jahqw7e,t1_jahplsu
And what made Bale agree to come back ?,Spurs,Yes,jahpoxc,t1_jahplsu
"Modric is too important to Madrid for him to come back, Bale was surplus to requirements for years before we got him on loan",Spurs,Yes,jaiht6k,t1_jahplsu
Think it’s not a bad idea to start Sanchez or tanganga instead of Dier. They need game time and Dier will miss the 2nd leg against Milan anyways so this is a good opportunity for them to get some game time beforehand.,Spurs,Yes,jai2bo0,t1_jahpma1
"mental people are putting blame on dier for that goal. 4 players let him just slide right past them, Dier was marking in his zone and cutting off a passing lane.",Spurs,Yes,jak6f06,t1_jak531v

Between him and Moura I'd guess,Spurs,Yes,jahp7as,t1_jahdziq
"There's also been tactical changes. He's now driving to the center, instead of overlapping deki on the line, also no more crosses, unless it's the last option (one of those should have been a Kane goal and an assist for him)",Spurs,Yes,jagvw1s,t1_jaglpr5
">It wasn’t a gradual improvement, it was like someone flicked a switch.

There were signs. Towards the back end of last season he had some really good showings once Doherty was injured, I seem to remember Liverpool away being one of them. Then for whatever reason he started this season really poorly, which is why I'm not getting carried away with this current spell and am still very glad we got Porro. But the important thing is we know he has this level of performance in him and he's still young, it's just about delivering it consistently now. And as someone else mentioned Kulu coming back has definitely been a factor as they combine very well.",Spurs,Yes,jagsoot,t1_jaglpr5
"Je was always really good defensively, and has always been decent at little 1 2s and short passes. People forget he was starting every game of the run in when we were great last season and he was good. 

When deki got injured though he had to play more out on the touchline and crossing and beating a man aren't his skills. So he looked rubbish. 

Deki coming back has been the key.",Spurs,Yes,jagmf95,t1_jaglpr5
"I think its down to the nickname royalzhino, because he has been super ever since. Like he is trying to play up to the standards of the name.",Spurs,Yes,jags8gy,t1_jaglpr5

I was just thinking about that too. Watched a post match analysis video that was  30 minutes long and in those 30 minutes we barely got mentioned at the last 2-3 minutes of the video.

Let's go A team and hope we can bench early,Spurs,Yes,jaieedr,t1_jahxuvg
Starting to agree now. Should've just given Gil more minutes and maybe bought a cheap backup striker (similar to Llorente or Vinicius). Then spend big on a defender. Useless management.,Spurs,Yes,jajqhv3,t1_jajnlzs
"I like Paratici, but you are right. Richarlison was a bad signing. We needed CBs much more than additional wing depth. Conte doesn't even give him minutes. With that said, I think Richarlison was a Conte signing. thats the worst part.",Spurs,Yes,jajoggl,t1_jajnlzs
obviously Paratici would’ve signed off on it but all reports say Levy was the one that came up with it and was keen on it,Spurs,Yes,jajrmcv,t1_jajnlzs

"The bipolar thing is so true... and its easy to say ""We need better CBs/WBs or the season is over!""

But realistically how many CBs are out there for reasonable fees that are truly more than lateral moves?  Dier isnt all that bad.  He has moments that make you bang you head against the wall, but so do LOTS of CBs.  finding someone more consistent would cost $.  and its easy to say go spend it, but its alot harder for Levy to actually pull it off without overpaying for every player fans want.

Rational fans will stay the course.  just gotta let the bipolar ones ride the rollercoaster sometimes.

"Emerson for me. Leao+Theo Hernanez is a lot to deal with and I’d trust Emerson out there more. More match fitness and better chemistry with Romero.

Milan's strength is their left side ... So we need our best defensive fullback. Emerson is clearly that.,Spurs,Yes,jagtvvv,t1_jagoy0x
"Not sure there is any debate here.  Even if Emerson wasn't on great form (he is), he is there to run a block against strong teams while Porro is supposed to unlock weaker and defensive teams.

Agreed that we need to strengthen our CBs. However, think we need to think our GK strategy through a bit more though, I wouldn't mind us paying over the odds for a good keeper as they are so so so important.

Very few managers make the step up into a big job like that without having either played for a top team or managed one.",Spurs,Yes,jaguf86,t1_jagtsz7
"Oh yeah for sure. Boehly and co have destroyed the entire infrastructure at Chelsea. They changed far too much far too quickly, both off the pitch and on it.",Spurs,Yes,jagvchc,t1_jagv76g
"He doesn't have a plan. It's been months, and he still has no idea what his matchday squad should look like. He's having them play a style that clearly doesn't suit the players' abilities and refuses/is unable to have them play any other way despite months of poor results. As Robbie Earle said on the US broadcast, the players look like they've already quit on him.

Yet you still have people defending the job he's doing and making excuses for him (likely because he's the young English fancystats guy). The latest one is how he just needs more time to get all the new players to work together. Forrest replaced basically their entire squad this year, yet it didn't take Steve Cooper nearly as long to get his team working together and playing the way he wanted.",Spurs,Yes,jahgpx3,t1_jagwx73
Ego and arrogance will be their downfall. They seem to believe they can do no wrong. They have not even considered that these players could flop and what will happen if they do.,Spurs,Yes,jagx374,t1_jagvxfe
"It's not about being rated. If you come in to a club in January you need to start playing straight away without much training. The least you need to be able to do is understand what your manager is telling you and communicate with your team mates. 

It's easier in the summer when you can assimilate with your team mates, pick up on the language a bit and learn from training sessions.",Spurs,Yes,jaguplw,t1_jaguif8

"Agree. Losing a one off league match to any opposition is only 3 points dropped out of 114 at the end of the day, but we genuinely have a really good chance of silverware in this competition right now considering there are only 2 teams left I think we'd lose to in a final",Spurs,Yes,jahqgt8,t1_jahlecg
"I’m not having that either, his ball winning and the way he helps compress the pitch by getting so tight is key to us actual keeping possession higher up the pitch",Spurs,Yes,jaltojn,t1_jakss78

I'm aware Eccleshare is an arsenal fan but hes very positive about spurs and at the very keast doesn't act like covering the club is a chore that gets in the way for him!

My point on Spiers beign a Wolves fan is I can't think of a more depressing club to cover/follow than them. You would have thought he'd be delighted to get away from that for half a season.",Spurs,Yes,jai5k7f,t1_jai533d
"Yeah absolutely. Spiers is obvs a good journo but deary me just try and be a bit positive and cater to your audience a bit

He said we aren't comparable to UTD beciase if you take out kanes goals we would be midtable....despite the fact if you take out rashfords goals, UTDs 2nd and 3rd highest scorers have less goals than our 2nd and 3rd highest.",Spurs,Yes,jai681z,t1_jai4v2z
Yeah. His tactical analysis is really good but on the pods and stuff it really comes across like he's looking to just stick the knife in wherever possible!,Spurs,Yes,jai7e4a,t1_jai5pt2
"Even aside from the fact he seems to hate covering the club, Spiers just has so much less charisma than Charlie as well.

"Have you listened to the Athletic Football podcast this week with Chappers? It's a spurs special one and honestly as you say it's like he's got a gripe against the club or something. JPB almost feels like he's sticking up for the club by the end of it.

It's basically like how I would cover Arsenal so maybe he just doesn't like spurs! And I know this all makes me sound like a whiney little bitch but it is a but taxing to listen to when you pay money to do so!",Spurs,Yes,jai6uwt,t1_jai6hmt
"You know what mate you may have actually hut the nail on the head here. 

Originally I was thinking that maybe Daniel Levy had denied him a parking permit or something, but maybe its just his schtick and his way if doing things. 

Tbh I've probably been a tad harsh here and when things are going badly I agree with everything he says. But when things are going pretty well it still seems a bit neggy, and it's like come on mate throw us a bone",Spurs,Yes,jaiilfq,t1_jaihock

"It’s really the stubbornness to not even consider mixing things up that I find frustrating.

Knowing that the system hasn’t worked well when we have to create, he has shown zero flexibility in adjusting his tactics.

And personally the final draw was him starting Son + Perisic again. That combo has clearly not worked all season, and we finally seemed to come alive a little. Knowing how critical that position is, why go back to what never worked?

Yes, we need to replace a lot of players and rebuild. But given Conte’s stubbornness, I have zero confidence he’s the man for the job unless the board is willing to pour hundreds of millions and get the exact world class players in Conte’s mold.",Spurs,Yes,jala4gu,t1_jakjq3k

"Absolutely. After the summer we had, I’ve stopped caring about top 4. We didn’t bring in a single game changer, our best transfer in the past 5 years was when we were in ECL (Romero) and when we got knocked out embarrassingly and weren’t sniffing at top 4 (Kulu and Benta).

CL is Important obviously, but I’d rather take the risk of not beating Wolves and us playing close to our strongest lineup today.",Spurs,Yes,jagqvd1,t1_jagqnso

"I really rate him and think he'd be great with more appearances. I think, if we had given Danjuma all the minutes that Richy has had in the PL, he'd have at least one goal. Nothing against Richy but Danjuma can also help.",Spurs,Yes,jahi989,t1_jahgh98
Completely disagree with that first part. Players can and do change over night and our tactics haven't changed at all in terms of how Emerson/Kulu work together,Spurs,Yes,jahf0t9,t1_jaglx0k
Oh without question.,Spurs,Yes,jagt1h1,t1_jagnuzw
"Hahaha, I’ve mainly ended up in this position because I live close to Sheffield and I’ve never had chance to see a Spurs game (I can’t afford it basically).

"Yeah I know its very annoying. 

Guardian pod literally did all Chelsea for 20 mins, which was all very similar to when Chelsea lost to saints anyway. And the only thing they mentioned was Skipp looks older than he is, and someone said he was just a solid player.

 Which is also just wrong given he's looked like he's getting back to his ways when he was being talked about as making the England squad and being future captain!",Spurs,Yes,jah3czn,t1_jagu4sc

nah I think it was a Conte signing. I can't blame Levy for Richarlison. Levy did want Djed Spence though.,Spurs,Yes,jajshvu,t1_jajrmcv
"""good during an international tournament"" has never been a surefire indicator of a player's quality. He doesn't have Neymar playing with him at Spurs lol

He has a very poor Sonny and similarly poor form Kulu (or Moura who is just shit)


Richy isn't a good winger (Danjuma is better on the left, Kulu is better on the right) and he will never play striker for us regularly as long as Kane is here. What's the point?",Spurs,Yes,jajoaj2,t1_jajnyxn

Just because we perform poorly, doesn’t mean people need to be irrational and start piling hate lol since it clouds their rational judgement.

I mean go to any top team and imagine their captain/Goalkeeper, their best CB, their best midfielder, back up attackers became injured and I don’t know what team would do well in those scenarios. 

Either way, I’d much rather see our fans support the team and players thru good and bad (as long as they return the same effort to us fans). But that’s a pipe dream haha",Spurs,Yes,jaiyhq6,t1_jaioii4

Romero is a proper world class CB, exactly what he was missing

Perisic is experienced and he’s wanted him before

Bentancur is a quality midfielder, Skipp is more developed, and these two are better than Winkssoko. Even then Bissouma is another option

Richarlison is exactly the kind of “intelligent cunt” he likes and actual backup for Kane

Kulusevski gives him an actual useful player on the right wing, great work rate and hold-up play

Royal is a good defensive fullback, miles better than Aurier who conceded a penalty or dangerous FK every other game

Even Lenglet is better than our CB options from that season


Our current squad suits him more than his actual one

Likewise Richarlison - at the time I wanted Jesus but I wasn't disappointed at the Richy transfer, he's a PL proven attacker who starts for Brazil and in theory provided backup for any of our front 3. Again nobody could foresee him falling off a cliff. Perisic was one of the world's best LWBs and already played under Conte. Lenglet and Spence low risk backups with high potential upside. It's very easy to criticise in hindsight.

Also look at 2021 - that is now looking like a 7/10 window minimum with Emerson and Sarr now performing, Gil the only blot. There's a decent chance the same thing happens with this last summer's window.",Spurs,Yes,jakgnh8,t1_jak7t6j
imagine if Dier gets paid more than 100 k per week....,Spurs,Yes,jajmbx0,t1_jajlit1
"I couldn’t think of a better word to describe it tbh, I was begging for us to keep the ball on the floor just for 5 consecutive passes. Wrexham gave them 2 better games than we did and it is absolutely embarrassing",Spurs,Yes,jajv0b0,t1_jajutm4
Some of these players are genuinely allergic to the ball,Spurs,Yes,jajwc05,t1_jajutm4
Yep agreed,Spurs,Yes,jaiqnjr,t1_jainwu8
I hate that you are probably right.,Spurs,Yes,jajsehz,t1_jajr3t8
I may be a twat but you’re here teaching your kids to actually throw the toys out of their pram. Good riddance. We don’t need another generation of moaners clogging the stands like you,Spurs,Yes,jamsk39,t1_jakyvee
" I'm tired of everyone just bringing up Levy and just putting him on blast everytime we have one of these terrible losses. Yes we know he's shit at the footballing side, don't need to bring it up for the 5000000th time ffs.",Spurs,Yes,jajn614,t1_jajm3xe
"There was literally an article in The Athletic a few days ago about him being a Levy signing, I’m sure it was a signing Conte was happy with from what he’s said about Richy vs Spence but still.",Spurs,Yes,jajt2km,t1_jajshvu
"the point was depth. It seems everyone forgot what was the talking points end of last season, and that's fair, this season has been long and disastrous. The talking points at the end of last season were that our XI was good, except for the wingback positions and we just needed more depth. That's why we spunked 150M on these depth signings + Perisic which Conte then proceeded to barely integrate with the exception of Perisic.  
However, there was a solid group of people that were unhappy with our January window, specifically over the lack of big name signings. They were probably right given how now the talking points are that our signings suck and our starting XI isn't good enough.",Spurs,Yes,jajumt3,t1_jajoaj2
"Great for Everton, great for Watford, we signed him before the WC",Spurs,Yes,jajuj9f,t1_jajoaj2
"I appreciate the effort. You seem like a nice guy. It just sucks that we root for a club that doesn't love us back. this shit is so sad man.

United people talking about Glazers out, United have won MANY trophies under them. We are an absolute joke.",Spurs,Yes,jajq3a2,t1_jajkoak
"Boy howdy I sure do hope Tottenham pay 500k a week to bring Zat Knight out of retirement, he would shore up any backline.",Spurs,Yes,jai23jv,t1_jahvd17
"You're right.  He is.  AT BEST, in my opinion, he's somewhere between the 70th and 90th best CB.  Thats alot of better CBS.  Now which ""top 50 defender from a top club"" is available to be brought in for a price that we can pay and that another club wont outbid us?

I would love to upgrade.  Bring on Bastoni or Gvardiol... hell I want them both.  But right now, it doesn't seem that is practical solution for the Club, even if we as fans want it.",Spurs,Yes,jaiqowv,t1_jaioo5g
"No exchange for away seats or cup games in general, applicants can ask for a refund and the club will try to replace them from the queue.

Only option now is risking a scam via twitter.",Spurs,Yes,jagpwlm,t1_jagpp8s
I guess I am Conte out now. :(,Spurs,Yes,jajnnbz,t1_jaht93q
"That's 3 out of 11 positions. And I'm sorry but sheff utd played their b team. That's all on conte and the layers tonight again. We literally made 0 chances. Not one.  

Draws just been done and we woukd have been home to Blackburn. Why are we prioritising wolves away at the weekend and top 4 over actually winning something?

Our best player may leave in the summer because he wants to win trophies. And we drop him in agame that's our best chance in years.",Spurs,Yes,jajkq6o,t1_jajjah4
"From a managerial perspective, I think we missed out on not trusting Poch and then Mou as well. Conte last season played the Mourinho way with two new additions and some tweaks. I guess backing Mou would have been a better choice in the long run. Conte this season is trying to play his own way and failing spectacularly so far. It wont be wrong to say that we play the worst football in EPL. Anyway I don't expect to win trophies supporting Spurs. Gave up that dream a long time ago. I just want to see some decent football. No chance of that with Conte in charge.",Spurs,Yes,jajrsur,t1_jajpzlt
Sorry mate only meltdowns allowed in here tonight.,Spurs,Yes,jakhkt0,t1_jak28h9
"I've accepted it. I was initially opposed to it just because I love Poch and I think it is slightly too soon for him to come back. (he needs a better squad), but then again we need someone to get the best out of Son again, and Kane might be leaving anyways, so why not give Poch the rebuild he deserved with us. He shouldn't have gotten sacked in the first place so I get it. I'm just worried man, ENIC has shown me before they won't back Poch.",Spurs,Yes,jai1q19,t1_jai05nx
I want Gallardo personally,Spurs,Yes,jai1jn8,t1_jai19qt
I would take Pau Torres. He’s excellent,Spurs,Yes,jalznnt,t1_jajn7tw
I agree with you. See my above post.,Spurs,Yes,jah5slx,t1_jah5jsc
100% cb and gk are the massive holes in the team. Just think as we have seen with us and what is sort of happeing with liverpool this season. We have to look 2 to 3 years ahead to keep and push the limit.,Spurs,Yes,jah4q98,t1_jah44ho
"I’m usually fairly level headed but that was awful. Rotating doesn’t excuse a loss to fucking Sheffield United. I’m sorry. You’re far too detached if you’re not a little fucked off by Sanchez, Dier, Perisic….etc",Spurs,Yes,jajjy5l,t1_jajj6yo
It was our only chance for a trophy this season,Spurs,Yes,jajl6ea,t1_jajj6yo
">get some perspective

he says while completely ignoring the significance of the result",Spurs,Yes,jak9fel,t1_jajjjp1
I do. I'm done with this.,Spurs,Yes,jajuwcv,t1_jajtkca
Son is past it??? After 1 bad srason i  5+ ? Rich sucks after 1 bad sdason also? Bench them now yeah but they probs will kick on later,Spurs,Yes,jale3w9,t1_jal0vho
"I wish I knew.  That was terrible.

Such a shame.",Spurs,Yes,jam1691,t1_jajipso
"Our form hasn't been that different to theirs. In fact, we have picked up more points than them in the league over the last 9 games just to show you that. It is definitely fine margins. Losing to your rivals kills you in the premier league. 

The top teams pretty much always beat the majority of the other 14 over the course of a season - you are able to compete for the title only when you can beat the teams around you. 

You can argue they have played better football than us sure, I accept that. But based purely off results there's not much in it. H2H results with your rivals are vital.",Spurs,Yes,jagwwbl,t1_jagvs1l
Agreed,Spurs,Yes,jahnftc,t1_jahhspa
They have 2 games in hand and only 9 points off us.  They’ve won 2/3,Spurs,Yes,jahhyns,t1_jahhh16
[deleted],Spurs,Yes,jahs7g6,t1_jahrhwh
[deleted],Spurs,Yes,jaht02o,t1_jahrhwh
Or it means they've higher standards than we do. See Arse with Kroenkes,Spurs,Yes,jal66lq,t1_jakaq4q
Oh yes I completely agree with you. Apologies I misunderstood.,Spurs,Yes,jaii62x,t1_jaic1gt
"It's common sense though that if you are broadcasting to a specific group then perhaps try and be a little more forgiving.

Ans yes I know how choice works, so thanks for explaining. But as I said I'm locked in and paying for an athletic subscription so kind of feel I want to at least get something for my money.",Spurs,Yes,jai6i24,t1_jai5b78
"""Idk why every manager we hire insists on Dier tho"" 

I'm tired robbie. Please, Free us from Dier. Please, whichever Manager avoids Dier will be the next Ten Hag for us. I believe!",Spurs,Yes,jajrlfk,t1_jajq8m1
dogshit defensive football,Spurs,Yes,jalbx8z,t1_jaks4h2
Then what happened,Spurs,Yes,jalbxpw,t1_jal8kse
"It’s important, but so is finally winning a fucking trophy. We are a big PL club, people overestimate the significance of top 4. Look at the sort of players non CL clubs are able to attract, so have we over the past 1.5 years while playing ECL ffs. 

Bentancur is by far our best midfielder. When PEH is in it he’s great, but we’ve seen his form go up and down many times. Bentancur gives you consistently good performances. I also think Kulusevski is a better signing then Hojbjerg. Finally gave us a quality player on the right alongside Son and Kane.",Spurs,Yes,jaguh14,t1_jags81w
"When I saw his pass to Vini in the CL game against LIV, I had seen enough to want to rally hard to get him.",Spurs,Yes,jahwlp1,t1_jahva50
Just so extremely typical from us,Spurs,Yes,jajw2dn,t1_jajv0b0
It's pathetic. The system does not help but mentally they are absolute poltroons,Spurs,Yes,jajwo4r,t1_jajwc05
"levy is a nice guy but he is so clueless when it comes to football. I will say it and I will keep saying it.

 Deal with it.",Spurs,Yes,jajovqr,t1_jajn614
if this is true.... that is horrendous from Levy. Let Paratici make his signings ffs,Spurs,Yes,jajtlps,t1_jajt2km
"He was never ""great,"" he's an above average PL attacker at best. Not someone who improves upon any of our existing front 3 (when they're all fit).

This club can't sign actual top class wingers like Leão so we have to suffer with this.",Spurs,Yes,jajvcl6,t1_jajuj9f
"Gvardiol and Bastoni are top 10, even 5. You telling me we cant get a top 50 cb? Lack of ambition and shit management. Dont disagree that levy might not but that justtelld u how dire thingsr",Spurs,Yes,jaiqtx3,t1_jaiqowv
"Oh wow didn’t know that, guess its for those who got in early unlike me haha, thanks again, I’ll leave it, not risking getting scammed.",Spurs,Yes,jagq06k,t1_jagpwlm
What a fuckin waste :(,Spurs,Yes,jajv18a,t1_jajnnbz
"I don't know how I'd have felt if we backed Mou to be honest. For me I don't think the answer for us lies in these ""serial winner"" coaches who demand the best players in the world to do anything significant. Would much rather go back to the Poch route, although I'd prefer if it'd be someone new rather than Poch. At least then as you said we would have good football even if we win fuck all.",Spurs,Yes,jajtug5,t1_jajrsur
Gallardo is my top realistic choice. paratici also likes Gallardo as well according to Fabrizio. That one is possible. Spalleti would be absolutely class though lol.,Spurs,Yes,jai4ua5,t1_jai1jn8
"thats good. Pau Torres might be doable.

I also like the torres romero combination.",Spurs,Yes,jam6avx,t1_jalznnt
And what will we do? Fire conte and start the cycle over? It’s not like this is a new occurrence… it’s a bad loss but seriously the reaction around here is equally pathetic.,Spurs,Yes,jakj61d,t1_jak9fel
they beat an abject Everton as part of those 2 and a 10 man Newcastle,Spurs,Yes,jaiaclu,t1_jahhyns
"No worries lol, I was also joking.

I just think we can't lose tonight because we are aware of our opportunity in this competition.",Spurs,Yes,jahtdgz,t1_jahs7g6
Hes on your side you idiot,Spurs,Yes,jahwexm,t1_jaht02o
Don’t fucking apologise man wtf is wrong with you. Never again,Spurs,Yes,jaiigai,t1_jaii62x
"You can read the athletic for free on your phone if you click on an article and enable reader mode on your browser

You're the one saying it's been 3 straight years.,Spurs,Yes,jammzci,t1_jalbxpw
"The best ability is availability, Hojbjerg is never injured unlike those two.",Spurs,Yes,jagvfs4,t1_jaguh14
"Could see it coming from a mile away tbh, same predictable shite as we always produce when we have to take the game to someone else. I’m on my knees for a manager that has an ounce of positional fluidity",Spurs,Yes,jajwc2u,t1_jajw2dn
"I've found the simplest way to see if a player, especially if it's a defender, is any good or not in terms of technical ability.

It's just looking at what they do when under pressure when they have the ball at their feet or have a free header. You watch players like a Thiago Silva or Lisandro Martinez and they always calmly pass to a teammate and work their way out of trouble the vast majority of the time.

Then you watch Dier and Davies and Sanchez and my eyes bleed. Open headers, time on the ball and they just hoof horrible long balls or head it straight to the opposition",Spurs,Yes,jajxa61,t1_jajwo4r
Hahahaa brings up Leao just to solidify how emotional and illogical everything you say is. Chef's kiss,Spurs,Yes,jajvhlq,t1_jajvcl6
"It still takes 2 to tango.

Levy could find a player and the team/player just may not want to deal.  Fiorentina seem set to keep Milenkovic.

Maybe a player wants to stay in a certain league/country.  Take them out of the population. Many players just stay in their home leagues (see bayern).

I'd imagine Levy also isnt looking for guys who are on the wrong side of 30 otherwise why not try to keep Toby around?  So take out them, too.

The pool of players that fit what would be most ideal starts to get really small, really quick.  Just saying it never as simple as we want it to be.  You can choose to accept that or not.

I'll just hope we play a good game today.",Spurs,Yes,jaiuprq,t1_jaiqtx3
"Why are you so mad? He never said Dier is a top defender. He’s been solid for us but isn’t world class and falls off through the season recently but we definitely need a world class upgrade. How often are those available to us? Romero’s transfer gives me hope for us attracting a world class CB but we tried for Bastoni who just didn’t want to move from Inter and Gvardiol, maybe we could have gotten him early but he was also adamant on staying at Leipzig.

If we can get Romero in the situation we were in at that time, I’m sure we can and will get a proper replacement for Toby/Jan but they don’t grow on trees unfortunately",Spurs,Yes,jaizhsx,t1_jaiqtx3
How many points do you have?,Spurs,Yes,jagq3g5,t1_jagq06k
"Absolutely. All the problems arose with Poch sacking. We didn't even stick to arguably our greatest EPL manager for two months of bad results. I am wholeheartedly Poch in now. About Mou, what I meant is Mourinho undoubtedly  seems like a better tactician than Conte. Both play shit football no doubt.",Spurs,Yes,jajvmw3,t1_jajtug5
"we have essentially nothing but top 4 to play for at this point, the reaction is completely justified",Spurs,Yes,jalq1nu,t1_jakj61d
"Ok.  So I’ll say it again, they have 2 games in hand and 9 off us.  Let’s stop acting like they’re out of the race.",Spurs,Yes,jaiak1o,t1_jaiaclu
"Hard for me to say it's the manager after what we've seen for so long, some of these players are just not up to it and never have been. Perpetual losers",Spurs,Yes,jajwi0z,t1_jajwc2u
Could we sign Khvicha? Leão? Chiesa? Nobody we can realistically get is fit to lick Son's boots,Spurs,Yes,jajxqps,t1_jajvhlq
"Such bullshit, we are one of the top 10 richesy clubs in the world",Spurs,Yes,jaiuuhy,t1_jaiuprq
"Oof not many maybe 30-40 points I wouldn’t have a chance.

My first game will be next Wednesday against AC Milan for my birthday.

I live up north it’s not easy getting to a game in London, Sheffield isn’t as far for me though, that’s why I thought I’d chance it.",Spurs,Yes,jagqaud,t1_jagq3g5
Yes but are they playing well?,Spurs,Yes,jaipyus,t1_jaiak1o
"True, I just want something fresh altogether tbh",Spurs,Yes,jajwnqq,t1_jajwi0z
">Sheffield isn’t as far for me though, that’s why I thought I’d chance it.

I've said this elsewhere, but if you're not far definitely go to the Spurs pubs before the game and ask around if anyone's selling a spare, I've done it loads and never failed to get a ticket for face value. If that fails hang around the away end and ask everyone. There will be loads of people whose mate couldn't go at the last minute.",Spurs,Yes,jagsiub,t1_jagqaud
"Go for the home end mate, you can still come to the pubs with us before/after, if Sheffield aint far for you.

And yeah, you need about 270 loyalty points and a season ticket, that was the cutoff, so don't beat yourself up haha.",Spurs,Yes,jagqf2e,t1_jagqaud
Based on their prior form?  Yes.  I’ll ignore the Madrid game though lol,Spurs,Yes,jaiqw5t,t1_jaipyus
"That sounds like a plan cheers, I’ll have a look when I get chance at lunch for some tickets and I’ll message back here. Failing that, it’ll be up the spurs for me against Milan haha. 

Thanks again, better keep an eye out for games closer to me in the future a lot sooner, help to get my points up.",Spurs,Yes,jagqo17,t1_jagqf2e
I think they might have looked worse against Palace,Spurs,Yes,jair2tc,t1_jaiqw5t
"To be blunt with you, to get in for a chance at away games, you first need a season ticket when you said you cant make it to London often. And then you need to attend most cup home games for about 4 years to even start scraping the points cut-off for some games.",Spurs,Yes,jagr0y3,t1_jagqo17
