"Two rather unremarkable moments from Vieira stood out to me last night.  First, he had the ball in the left half space and made a simple pass to Eddie, but he remained in his space - I think he did this a couple of times.  This is the kind of thing I want to watch back again because, in the moment, it seemed pretty disciplined to not make the run in following the pass - which was something he did in other situations. 

The second was when he nicked the ball off Davies on the right sight and played a switch to KT on the LW.  Looked like a proper DLP.  Both of these moments stood out because they were ""midfielder"" plays rather than ""attacking midfielder"" or ""attacking"" types of plays.  

There is a whole lot that goes into playing the 8s in this team, and I thought both of these pretty small moments were good examples of how Vieira has matured and developed this season.  Looking forward to him getting some game time in the coming weeks.",Arsenal,No,jamb8pq,t3_11fwyxk

"Good morning lads, cloud day here in North London today. 

Mathematically city can only reach a total of 94 points if they win all of their remaining 13 games. Therefore the title winning threshold to guarantee it is currently 95 points. 

We are 63.8% of the way to this target, each three points we earn is a huge contributor to winning it. 

A 34 point haul is required, which is at least 11 wins and a draw from our remaining 13 games. 

Tottenham can only reach 84 points from their remaining 13 games. Therefore the threshold for top 4 is 85 points. 

We are 70.59% of the way to this target. Tottenham will almost certainly drop more points like against Leicester (4-1 lmao) so this will likely reduce radically. If we assume 75 points (the standard total) we are 80% of the way to champions league football.",Arsenal,No,jalpibc,t3_11fwyxk
"A few thoughts on last night:

 - Not only a hugely important 3 points, but a hugely important vendetta win against a side we never should have dropped 3 points to in the first place. It happens, whatever, I don't want to relitigate that fixture, but it is extremely important for our continued success that this squad keeps finding motivation to rectify each and every mistake or missed opportunity. I felt it in the United home fixture too, this added ""fuck you"" attitude we have in those revenge games, the physicality is raised, confidence is sky high. Those are all factors that are massive for EL and CL knockout stages, good to see we already have some of that in us.

 - Trossard coming in and basically replicating the very particular and demanding role that Jesus was performing before the World Cup might just prove to be the X-factor we needed for the second half of the season. I'm not writing off Eddie, he's a good and necessary squad player, even last night he proved how dangerous he can be when the game is more open. But we also needed someone more similar to Jesus, and what a shrewd piece of business the Trossard deal was, highway robbery if you ask me. Once Jesus is back to full fitness as well, it's all over for these low block hoes.

 - Jorginho didn't have the best of games, but it was great to see Thomas fit enough to play an entire half, he bossed it, hopefully he's fit to start on Saturday.

 - Saka and Martinelli are somehow both Him, he comes in many forms apparently. When you factor in age and potential, I don't think there's a single club in the world barring Real Madrid who wouldn't swap wingers with us in a heartbeat. Blessings on blessings.

 - I've often been critical of him when I thought it was fair, so I should also be equally flattering when it is earned - Fabio Vieira looked like the real deal last night. Every touch was imperious, he had the game in the palm of his hand since the moment he came on. Don't expect him to be at that level every game at this stage in his career, but last night he looked class, man like David Silva and them.

 - Don't sell Tierney, he's so good. Things are going so well, we know Zinchenko is injury prone, don't create problems out of nothing. Who cares if he's not perfectly happy, it's not like he's stopped coming to training, and  he'll have more playing time between now and the end of the season. If we sold him, we are back to where we were last season where at any point we are one Zinchenko knock or sprain from having our entire season in crisis. Don't sell Tierney man.

 - Emile looked extremely off the pace, but I don't even care, it was just good to be reminded we have this lad. Even if it takes him until the end of the season to find his form, just play him as often as we can. We know he has the talent, let him work his way back and knock on wood he stays fit.

Our second goal had Martinelli on the right as well and our third had Trossard on the left. 

Our winner against Leicester had Trossard on the left, feeding Martinelli on the inside as well.  

It takes intelligent players to do - how do the rest of the team move, when the left back and left winger are suddenly both on the right - but it also takes a special manager to not only devise it, but to also communicate it to his players in a way that enables them to enact it on the pitch.

It all started in 2008 when I was in an internet cafe in India and decided to try playing computer games for the first time. I started FIFA 08 and just selected first team on default selection it happened to be Arsenal.

I liked the sound of all player names for the next hour and started reading about them and finally landed on Arsenal premier league pages and then fantasy premier league and selected Fabregas in the team and made him captain. That week I watched the first game which is Arsenal 6 - 2 Everton. Fabregas got around 44 points and he pushed me to top 100 or something in fantasy league.

Then I followed all matches each week and selected fantasy premier league. Before I know it this became a personal ritual and I forgot fantasy premier league altogether and I am very much invested in the arsenal team fortunes. My friends who are fans of Man utd, chelsea et al used to kock me for selecting Arsenal as my team to support but that never bothered me.

I did not see peak glory days like some of you fans but that also never bothered me. There is some connection and satisfying feeling seeing that kit and style of play.

We used to absolutely adore this quality when he broke into the side. 

My guess is that it‚Äôs systematic. Our pressing patterns have changed: think about Alexis. Pressing monster, but how often did his over agressive press leave a man unmarked?

High risk, high reward.

What I‚Äôve noticed with this arsenal team is that we‚Äôre not as concerned with actually getting the ball from opponents in the final third. Instead, the pressing plan (similar to how city do it) is all about cutting off the middle of the pitch, forcing a keeper or a CB long, and then winning a 2 v 1 in our back line. 

As a result, martinelli presses less to win the ball, but more to force a bad pass.

Trossard has somehow adjusted to Arteta-ball like he has been playing it for a decade. That look up and cut back to Odegaard was delicious. Many many players would have crossed that ball speculatively. He is a superb signing.",Arsenal,No,jalldcb,t3_11fwyxk
"I feel guilty for how bad I don‚Äôt want to see Elneny play lol.. I love him and wouldn‚Äôt be crushed if he had to fill-in, but ideally the Egyptian God will ride the bench to the title.. Also really wanted Viera to score yesterday, he seems like he could a little ego boost & that Partey ball deserved a finish.. Seeing ESR was lovely.. This was a fun one..",Arsenal,No,jalmc0r,t3_11fwyxk

modric might just be the best midfielder i've seen,Arsenal,No,jany982,t3_11fwyxk
As much as they get a lot of criticism I have to commend the people at AFTV for sticking with the club and building their own brand. Fans like myself felt so disconnected that I even stopped watching our games coz of how angry I used to get. Some of the AFTV guys are extremely toxic( I won‚Äôt mention names) but overall a positive atmosphere.,Arsenal,No,jaoo0br,t3_11fwyxk
Not convinced that Martinelli‚Äôs goals yesterday have as much to do with Trossard being on the pitch as they do with a tactical adjustment with him being instructed to move centrally more often. Eddie literally assisted one of Martinelli‚Äôs goals.,Arsenal,No,jalp5x7,t3_11fwyxk
zinchenko has quite literally become one of my favorite ever Arsenal players already and i've supported the club since the early 00s. the guy is MAGIC and a role model.,Arsenal,No,jalklx9,t3_11fwyxk

"Who is/are the players on our current squad that rival fans hate the most?? What do people hate most about us at the moment?? (Other than Arteta being a naughty boy on the sideline) I‚Äôm honestly curious.. In America when I talk to fans of rival clubs they seem to have nothing bad to say about us, (some Man City fans bitch that we ‚Äòtook‚Äô Jesus, Zinchenko & Arteta, which is just dumb) I‚Äôm wondering what the sentiment is like surrounding our current squad/standing in UK amongst fans of other clubs..",Arsenal,No,jaloloo,t3_11fwyxk
No.5 is different gravy isn‚Äôt he,Arsenal,No,jalorj5,t3_11fwyxk
I would guess we are looking at CMs/CDMs for fullback depth given Zinny's skill set. I could see us doing something insane like putting rice at RB.,Arsenal,No,jany5hm,t3_11fwyxk
"If we play Barca in Europa League final, it will be a higher class game than whatever the UCL title game is.",Arsenal,No,jaoiwu7,t3_11fwyxk
"If tierney did leave, I wonder if Dortmund would do a tierney  swap for Raphael Guerreiro (plus a transfer fee from dortmund)?  He would be a great rotation option for Zinny and tierney would get an opportunity to continue his development at a high level CL team where he will start.  I love tierney but I think keeping the system consistent and effective will be crucial if we want to make a deep UCL run next year and that means Zinny role depth.",Arsenal,No,japptpq,t3_11fwyxk
"Rewatched yesterday's highlights a few times and something is clearly going on with Xhaka. Multiple times he just let a player go beyond him, maybe to avoid the foul, and just put his arms up. Something feels off",Arsenal,No,jan3bz7,t3_11fwyxk
"There is onus on Jesus to pull his weight in terms of goals when he comes back. Saka and Nelli are going great right now but a dry spell is inevitable in the course of a season, we went through it in Feb and dropped 8 points. If Jesus can come back and get himself to 10 league goals I think we're guaranteed the league",Arsenal,No,jambsz6,t3_11fwyxk
With UCL coming up I don‚Äôt think we should sell KT. Moving Zinny moving up to Xhakas position looks like a huge possibility,Arsenal,No,jap1he7,t3_11fwyxk
"When we win the league, which moment do you think we will look back on this season as ""the moment we knew""? Or is that moment yet to come?

To make it more fun, can't say when we lift the trophy or when we beat City.

For me personally I think the Villa game might be it. Sometimes you just need the stars to align.

Edit: Knocking on wood as I typed this not to jinx it.",Arsenal,No,jam4cy0,t3_11fwyxk
"How will/should we go about squad additions as it stands?

Do we want a right back in the mould of Zinchenko and move Tomi to RCB, or do we want to add an RCB outright. Should we move for a Zinchenko like LB if KT leaves, or would a left side White like profile be beter? 

Do we want to add an 8/10 to the squad or do we just want an 8? If the Gary Jacobs report is anything to go by, do we want both Caicedo and Rice or is it a one or the other case? I personally want to see more goals/assists from the left mid side because although Xhaka is good, we can upgrade there. 

We'll likely move for a right winger, but who could that be? 

What do we do with Balogun, especially if our desire is a taller striker? Is bringing in a third striker regardless (like Hojlund) a good move? 

Too many questions in my head, had to voice them. Don't mind me, I'm just a hopeful fan posting after a long day of work.",Arsenal,No,janpp4y,t3_11fwyxk
"We won 4-0 and Odegaard scored so I might get pelters for saying this, but Odegaard has a few too many anonymous first halves of football against physical opposition/midfields.

To his credit he almost always turns it around in the second half and makes an adjustment or two, likely with Arteta's guidance. But that's the next step in his development and an important one in my opinion.",Arsenal,No,jallhsb,t3_11fwyxk
It's genuinely criminal how Moyes hasn't been sacked yet,Arsenal,No,jalov59,t3_11fwyxk
"TOTS so far - what would you change ?

Raya

"My biggest criticism of Arsene emirates era is not making cheap, smart signings. We could of been so much better by signing Tomi type signings. Unless transfer amortisation is a new thing and that 10-15 mil signings back then had to be paid all in one go. For years we had unbalanced teams and were always short either in goals, in defense, needing a DM or needing a striker. Makes no sense.",Arsenal,No,japdpo8,t3_11fwyxk
Man I am loving this season but every once in a while I think about our team having Partey in it and all that entails (his court case  etc) and it makes me sad that's gonna be a dark mark over our best season in recent memory,Arsenal,No,jan1ej2,t3_11fwyxk

I think we‚Äôll finish on 87-92 points end of the season.,Arsenal,No,jancdrb,t3_11fwyxk
"I reckon City can lose 6 points and finish on 88 points. That means we can drop 10 points max because they will have a better GD if we actually drop that many points. 10 points means we have the luxury to lose against Liverpool, City, and draw against Newcastle, Chelsea. Of course we should not rely on dropping that many points against 4 teams and winning out the rest.",Arsenal,No,jao6quu,t3_11fwyxk
"Going into the final 13 PL Matches & possible 5 EL fixtures if we're lucky to make the final.

I would like to see a more selfless Martinelli. Only 2 assists to his name doesn't do justice to his name. 

I hope Odegaard can shoot a little hit more.

"Kiwior should start this weekend. We should be aiming to win Europe league, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be wise to give him his debut against sporting away in such an important match and Bournemouth at home will be the easiest game we have this season. Let Gabriel start against sporting",Arsenal,No,jamftm3,t3_11fwyxk
Apparently Saka has the most consecutive games in the PL of any player right now. Anyone else a bit worried about the long term effects of this? You can really burn players out early in their career playing them too many games. We need to be able to rotate him more.,Arsenal,No,jallidn,t3_11fwyxk

Think we have a bit of a White problem. His form has dropped since the WC. He‚Äôs still good but I see him getting caught out a lot and needing someone to cover for him.

I don't think we were in jeopardy of losing but we could have given up at least 2 goals (thinking of one of the counters and then the chance at the end of extra time).

Liverpool have only been good for like 4 years. They were trash before that. Why do they think they can compete with us for transfers? Even if both of us get CL we will be the most desirable destination in England and Liverpool won't even be top 3.

Yesterday showed we still need to work on our ability to break through teams like Everton who just want to sit in all game. Yesterday it was one lapse in concentration from Tarkowski and an elite pass and finish from Zinny and Saka but some teams don't lose that concentration or other days we aren't at our best which is where we need to punish them more.

Such poise! Such NOISE!!

They only look potent when their first team is playing but they do look potent then. Sancho still remains an unknown quantity as well. They're in a similar setting to when Arteta had Auba firing, but with a much better squad.

"I am going to be the first to say, I expect us to continue building on whatever happens this year. 

We are on the right side of age curves. 

We actually play like the protagnist/main character energy.

We have manager who has built the culture and has tactical nous.

Arteta + Board learned after the first year that shortcuts weren't going to close the gap (Soares, Mari, Willian) since then our pick ups have been good to great.

Where I think there is some merit is that one, we currently have to swing a little over over our weight class to really compete money wise with the manchester clubs + newcastle + chelsea (we will see overtime how long boehly wants to burn money)  long term. Further depending on FSG's moves they might i guess go the way of the Oil.

I haven't read the article but it's easy to guess they are alluding to the financial power and potential Qatari ownership.

Perhaps a more realistic concern is just looking at the dominance of Liverpool and how quickly they got flipped around. less then a year ago they were a chasing a quadruple with a real opportunity to do so.

Long-term they made some bad decisions keeping guys and not refreshing their midfield.

All it takes is one mistep by us or liverpool and it becomes very difficult to make up the difference in buying power compared to some of our rich competitors.

Right now, we have an excellent opportunity for the league. Even if we get it. What is to stop PSG from looking at Saliba and going I'll have that and offering him like insane personal terms. We could match, and I hope we try, but his relationship with club has been up and down, he might decide France is better for him personally, plus a bump, all but guaranteed champions league.

Then we have to do our best to stop other guys in the room thinking about our prospects. Maybe if that happens, a guy like Martinelli who I think we should be able to get done, maybe Madrid or Barcelona comes in with wicked terms too, he has a decision to make, which we gotta match because we cant let guys like that walk and expect Saka to be happy with that.  

Suddenly our shopping list gets bigger and expectations will be sky high. It's one thing to have our pockets lined by PSG, it will be another to replace a guy like that. 

Even coming out on top of the league there is a scary potential of an avalanche.

 TLDR: Even if we finish top, there is going to be interest in our best young talent (Saliba, Martinelli, Saka etc.) Teams like PSG, Barcelona, Real Madrid, and god forbid teams in our league are at least going to kick tires. I dont think it will, but with other teams improving (Utd and Newcastle), City is going anywhere unless they lawyers have got worse. That's already three teams that aren't us that are going to try narrow the gap.",Arsenal,Yes,janw4eu,t1_jangmir
"His winning back of the ball quickly created quite a few opportunities, particularly for Gabi/Trossard/Eddie on the left and slight left of center.",Arsenal,Yes,jam59lt,t1_jam2df8
"remember when they were on about a powershift in north london, i wonder how that is tasting right now",Arsenal,Yes,jalkvuw,t1_jalkoro
"It's abundantly obvious from how good he is for brazil that he doesn't fit into that tottenham side at all. I think Jesus is clear but richarlison is better than this, counter attacking football isn't his strong suit. He thrives in a more possession based system like brazil's.

Unironically think if we had him he'd be balling for us",Arsenal,Yes,jalrk60,t1_jalqni4
"We've already done 5-0 at home this season, I'm sorry but I have to insist on 6-0.",Arsenal,No,jalva6i,t1_jalt3p1
Honestly I prefer we lead by 2 or 3 then sub all our key players off to preserve them. Longevity is critical.,Arsenal,No,jalz1ze,t1_jalt3p1
"Its hilarious seeing them justify always losing and genuinely arguing that they don't have the depth to compete for a cup. They have a ¬£60m striker, ¬£45m wingback and a ¬£43m CB who are all firmly backups and they still lost to a Championship team's backup team.",Arsenal,No,jaltw1j,t1_jalt3p1
let's hope they drop points to make it less stressful,Arsenal,Yes,jama8wk,t1_jam9kyk
Martinelli and his movement in particular are criminally underrated.,Arsenal,Yes,jam8ibh,t1_jam6xme
"Gueye also fell asleep and slid centrally which opened the passing angle for Zinny, really captured how switched on footballers need to be for 90 minutes straight. Then he had the giveaway that led to the second.",Arsenal,Yes,jam7y9j,t1_jam6xme
"If we win this title that goal will be the Overmars at OT goal where you point to and say that‚Äôs the goal
That won us the league. 
Huge goal for us.",Arsenal,Yes,jancpf3,t1_jamodk8

"It‚Äôs definitely the most balanced, no glaring weaknesses at all",Arsenal,Yes,japw0de,t1_japr1ob
It's close tbh. The 07 team was brilliant. I personally liked the 2010 team a lot too. I think now we're closer to be a proper unit of a team rather than a team carried by a few superstars or a single superstar like in the auba days or the nasri rvp and cesc days.,Arsenal,Yes,japsyqw,t1_japr1ob
Everything considered - this squad,Arsenal,Yes,japtjb0,t1_japr1ob
"yes, easily",Arsenal,Yes,jaqbpfq,t1_japr1ob
Good sensation,Arsenal,Yes,jalk8i0,t1_jalk5o4
Newcastle have tailed off lately and palace/pool are terrible,Arsenal,Yes,jam0619,t1_jalzwhi
Came here to say the same. He could use a start as much as Xhaka could use a rest.,Arsenal,Yes,jam4sm9,t1_jam0ib0
Big ears is not a realistic target. A deep run will be good next season,Arsenal,Yes,jam7cuz,t1_jam4az8
Only game prior to the Everton away one where we weren‚Äôt in complete control. We weathered the storm but man I was screaming nooooo noooo noooo like a horror film when the penalty was given at the end. My goodness I was grateful for VAR that day,Arsenal,Yes,jao8sc8,t1_jao1o0w
Leeds are the Tottenham of the north.,Arsenal,Yes,jao2bi9,t1_jao1o0w
Saka with a match winner is how. Plus Bamford missed a pen and Gabriel had a pretty good game. We were rubbish though and very lucky to get three points. If I remember correctly that was the game after Liverpool where Jesus had taken a hard blow to the head and hit the floor like a sack of potatoes. He was definitely playing like he had mild concussion in that game lol,Arsenal,Yes,jaoifkf,t1_jao1o0w
I hate Barca,Arsenal,Yes,jaog5kq,t1_jaoe87s
"Napoli and Arsenal are clearly top 5 in Europe this year, would love to see both do the double.",Arsenal,Yes,jaoki6y,t1_jaoh05t
"I think we will win the CL at least once in the next five years, and make it to the semis at least in most campaigns. Arteta really is just that guy.",Arsenal,Yes,jaohx4t,t1_jaoh05t
"Probably best you put this in caps!

It‚Äôs normally our fan base crapping on Martinelli, others love him unconditionally especially Liverpool! Hell I‚Äôve seen comments recently that Klopp should sign him in the summer to get Liverpool back on top.",Arsenal,Yes,jalncgq,t1_jalmyg1
 the funniest thing is that if the World Cup didn‚Äôt happen then every United fan would genuinely believe that Rashfords better than mbappe,Arsenal,Yes,jalnahd,t1_jalmyg1
That whole Man United team is on a purple patch post-WC. Can't wait till that ends.,Arsenal,Yes,jalpa6o,t1_jalmyg1

Gabriel is 100% going to be our record breaking transfer sale in the next 3/4 years. Can see Madrid coming in and offering something stupid at some point,Arsenal,Yes,jalmj99,t1_jalm1wv
Conveniently forgotten by our critics who think we‚Äôve been lucky to play teams without their own best players.,Arsenal,Yes,jalu4ip,t1_jalsbpa
also ESR getting minutes again is fantastic. remember that period when he was THE super sub? gonna be some good shit in the frustrating matches to come,Arsenal,Yes,jalw5um,t1_jalsbpa
Which is crazy because I think Odegaard is one of the players who is furthest away from his potential.,Arsenal,Yes,jammfsg,t1_jamgakg
He‚Äôs not really a number 10 but I agree nonetheless.,Arsenal,Yes,jamky9c,t1_jamgakg
"It's incredible. We've been saying for a few years, once he perfects his finishing, he's going to be a superstar. Well here it is.",Arsenal,Yes,jamriuy,t1_jamrbxh
"Yeah, with 13 games left, I can't pretend to myself that I wouldn't be gutted. If we finished second and won Europa, that would be a decent consolation though",Arsenal,Yes,jan3m7m,t1_jan0jri
"Season 13/14 taught me to keep a distance until last 8 games. We were leading the top right until March, quite a PTSD.",Arsenal,Yes,jan16pz,t1_jan0jri
"I am secretly hoping that Amazon ""forgot"" to take out some cameras and we get one for this season.

A man can dream!",Arsenal,Yes,japoiqe,t1_japkbf6
"I have the final episode to go for a while but can‚Äôt bring myself to watch knowing the disappointment, hoping to watch it at the end of this season looking back with new found joy.",Arsenal,Yes,japocmt,t1_japkbf6
I‚Äôll watch it after we win the title,Arsenal,Yes,japsngn,t1_japkbf6
"Palace have been a little bit of a bogey team for City so never know.

Really hoping Newcastle play the same way they did against us to City and shithouse their way to another 0-0 draw.

That being said - I can also see City winning that match anyways",Arsenal,Yes,jallyd1,t1_jallt49
"Palace can't score to save their life. Even if they do, they absolutely suck at protecting a lead.

That being said, they're one of City's bogey teams.",Arsenal,Yes,jallv9s,t1_jallt49
I think they'll turn Newcastle over then get stung by Palace. It's how their season has gone,Arsenal,Yes,jalmlli,t1_jallt49
People thought the same after the WC but we were back to winning ways.,Arsenal,Yes,jalrk8y,t1_jalr99r
"Thinking back to that tierney injury for Scotland last year. Such a fucking pointless endeavour, I have no end of hatred for international games outside of the world cup and euros",Arsenal,Yes,jalrwdy,t1_jalr99r
Can tell he's a child man. Really lacks wider perspective,Arsenal,Yes,jam78ff,t1_jam6dkd
"There was no way he couldn't pull that U turn, Gabriel is clearly elite",Arsenal,Yes,jamkzh9,t1_jam6dkd
Of course. Arguably the two best teams on the planet if you exclude Real.,Arsenal,Yes,jaom7uj,t1_jaok5z8
My bro would go Asda at weird times to try and get it lol. Marketing is crazy man,Arsenal,Yes,japm6vj,t1_japat9e
"Really feel like it is highly possible to get 12 points from the next 4 games (Palhinha out against Fulham is like playing Brighton without Caicedo).  Could be on 72 points with 9 games left by April 1st

"It worked on Gabriel. Although now that we see it, these things are just catalysts, not determinants.",Arsenal,Yes,jan63e9,t1_jamnwdc
He almost forgot to do it against Leicester until Zinchenko reminded him lol,Arsenal,Yes,japeeht,t1_jap5uno

Eric Dier is a player that belongs at that club. Someone like Kane does not.,Arsenal,Yes,janlly7,t1_janhbn3
It's crazy how long he has been at that club üò≥,Arsenal,Yes,janis98,t1_janhbn3
"Odegaard was mostly disrespected on Twitter. This sub disrespected him before he officially joined. And its just characteristic of the sub until they see players play.

Most cases we are attached to the resident starters. 

But like more signings and links will show, the coach still thinks this team needs beefing up.",Arsenal,Yes,japmtxw,t1_jap7pb9
What‚Äôs the odds?,Arsenal,Yes,jaltcfr,t1_jalsyzl
It‚Äôs probably because we are more likely to throw out weakened/roatated teams whereas they will be full strength. Also their draw next round is slightly easier than ours.,Arsenal,Yes,jam19nx,t1_jalsyzl
"It's because when teams open up, the left hand side is a pacey weapon on the counter.

I'd also add that Martinelli works best when playing against a defender running backwards but not as effective against a low block hence why Jesus and now Trossard begin able to swap positions with him is so important to mix things up when playing against a low block.",Arsenal,Yes,jalx4j5,t1_jalvu58
Arteta has probably already lined out how he thinks Rice will fit and how he can improve him while Chelsea are deciding whether to fire their manager or not. I‚Äôm confident.,Arsenal,Yes,jamzvd2,t1_jamza3e
Chelsea not setting any groundwork for a signing sounds right up their alley.,Arsenal,Yes,jamzzbc,t1_jamza3e
I remember when he was KFC server pretending to be an ITK. Guy isn't legit.,Arsenal,Yes,jan2rlu,t1_jamza3e

"> camavinga as a backup left back

we're officially back boys",Arsenal,Yes,jaom153,t1_jao902x
Signing Camavinga to play him at LB would be criminal.,Arsenal,Yes,jaohify,t1_jao902x
He could just replace Xhaka lol,Arsenal,Yes,jaoa4z6,t1_jao902x
"I've only seen about 5 Barca games this year but his stats are really, really good.

He's just under performing xG in a similar way to Jesus.",Arsenal,Yes,jaoajxj,t1_jao9mm8
"this is what happens when the pressure is on. and expected from a side that hasn't had the PL trophy in a minute. with time i feel like this gets better. but for now, this is going to be the formality.",Arsenal,Yes,jalpf82,t1_jalmxqr
Nerves.,Arsenal,Yes,jaloj1a,t1_jalmxqr
"I agree. 

Man United game had one of the worst atmospheres in a while for me. Even the pre-match song seemed to go wrong. I normally sit next to the ashburton army section - so lots of juniors which could explain it.

Brentford - had lots of people moaning after 10 minutes. 

My two recent experiences",Arsenal,Yes,jaln2of,t1_jalmxqr
"there are easy games, we played a double pivot of lokonga and AMN vs Watford last year while Tavares was also on the pitch.....",Arsenal,Yes,jamsb59,t1_jamnxk9
"of course no prem game is easy, and i don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll rotate, but on paper playing the 19th best team (worst defensively) at home is as easy as it gets ‚Ä¶",Arsenal,Yes,jamy53e,t1_jamnxk9
Xhaka was our MOTM in the first half. He was by the best player on the pitch. The goals overshadowed his involvement but he was everywhere in the first half.,Arsenal,Yes,jalndza,t1_jallgpt
"Love them, I always try and get tickets as close to block 25, yet to succeed lol

You can hear the atmosphere they generate through the screen and the players and manager have mentioned multiple times how the better atmosphere has helped them this season.",Arsenal,Yes,jalowin,t1_jalnsiv
"They've been amazing at creating an atmosphere at the Emirates. We needed some (nice) ultras. The Emirates used to B quiet and stale, it's completely different now. I'm glad we've got them, and hopefully they keep on growing!",Arsenal,Yes,jalow1a,t1_jalnsiv
Top lads,Arsenal,Yes,jalpp6q,t1_jalnsiv

Refs.,Arsenal,Yes,jama7xu,t1_jam3bn8
"Poor finishing.

Also, even the Centurions had some questionable results. 

I remember, to make those 100 points, they needed a 90' minute winner to humble 17th placed Southampton. They also drew with Huddersfield. 

Liverpool lost their first game vs relegated Watford in THAT season. In that stretch where they beat Liverpool, they won 1 game in 11. That game was vs Liverpool.",Arsenal,Yes,jam5g22,t1_jam3bn8
"I've never wanted to fuck Geordies so badly in my whole life.

De jong in the xhaka position wouldn‚Äôt be bad,Arsenal,Yes,jan9u0r,t1_jan8t16
Raphinha üôè,Arsenal,Yes,jan9lry,t1_jan8t16
what's happening there now??,Arsenal,Yes,janb07u,t1_jan8t16
"Maybe. I can imagine them selling some of Kessie, Raphina and maybe Fati. I also think it‚Äôs less likely they‚Äôll buy that young striker they are linked to: Victor Roque. Means we have a better chance.",Arsenal,Yes,jani8z0,t1_jan8t16
Quite obvious we will go back in for Raphinha,Arsenal,Yes,janlhkf,t1_jan8t16
"Martinelli is clear on the left, and we'd play Jesus up top, not at LW.

Trossard is good, and will get rotational minutes.",Arsenal,Yes,jangzlr,t1_jane1au
"The 3 of them are quite similar skillset wise. What they don't have is the outright speed of Martinelli. 

Martinelli gives us a better option in fast breaks and counters.",Arsenal,Yes,jangddp,t1_jane1au
"Martinelli made himself undroppable with the 4 in 3. Manager will have to be so brave to drop him.


However if this happens, Martinelli comes on between 60'-70'.",Arsenal,Yes,janfl3a,t1_jane1au
Martinelli has to start.,Arsenal,Yes,janmbok,t1_jane1au
[teta](https://imgur.com/gallery/3OsITcG),Arsenal,Yes,jao818x,t1_jane1au
Martinelli is the better individual player than Trossard,Arsenal,Yes,jangb07,t1_jane1au
"I don't think we can count Martinelli out. Despite his performance in general play being less-than-peak, he's producing numbers and when Jesus is back I expect it to further improve.",Arsenal,Yes,janekrp,t1_jane1au
"I was thinking yesterday about our opportunities to rest/ rotate when Jesus returns. A front 3 of Jesus/ Eddie/ Trossard is a scary prospect and would arguably be our most clinical front line in front of goal.

The flexibility we have built into our forward line in a short space of time is really impressive.",Arsenal,Yes,janm97v,t1_jane1au
Our best front 3 imo,Arsenal,Yes,jankrle,t1_jane1au
Seems completely achievable when you put it that way,Arsenal,Yes,jaoue38,t1_jaom4kx
"Yeah - I would say as long as the number of points in the grap isn't greater than the games left...e.g 10 points gap with 9 games to go. Then it's a close race.

We focus game by game",Arsenal,Yes,jaq5nde,t1_jappzyv
"Yup, 49 points still up for grabs. Never unclench.",Arsenal,Yes,japs8su,t1_jappzyv
"Jorgi is the best backup dm in the league far and away. I love what he's doing and I want to continue to see him play.

That being said, the starting dm, partey, is just different gravy. Last night he came on and blew everton away, genuinely showed the levels of a top class dm there and then. We show so much more confidence as well with partey in midfield.

If we have partey and Jesus fit for that april run we ain't getting beat I'm convinced",Arsenal,Yes,jals50z,t1_jalru6q
"He wasn't feeling well and Everton is maybe the worst matchup in the league for Jorginho, just athletic runners and nothing else.

Still was fine.",Arsenal,Yes,jalscde,t1_jalru6q
"Especially given the fact Chelsea are in a bit of a financial predicament. They have reiterated that Potter doesn't have to get top 4 this season as it is a ""transition"" season, but that is because they planned on selling Ziyech, RLC, Mendy and Lukaku to the tune of around 100m, which appears as instant profit on their books and offsets no Champions league revenue for a season. But of they sack Potter (which they are under real pressure to do) then they lose that 100m cushion because it costs 60m to sack potter and his staff plus they don't pat Brighton their fee for Potter til this summer and all of a sudden they are down 100m with a wage bill of 230mil, no champs league, 100m in transfers outgoing (purely due to volume of players signed) and a loan of 150m to repay within 5 years. 

No way they are funding 80/90m for Rice",Arsenal,Yes,jalmfp9,t1_jalm2gi
"Chelsea with no CL football should have zero shot of getting him. Not worried about them one bit. Get our future #6, and then find a #8 so we can replace Xhaka",Arsenal,Yes,jalm6e0,t1_jalm2gi
But bro _is_ insanely good looking,Arsenal,Yes,jam70rc,t1_jalztxb
"Started out with Barnet and got back to back promotions off the utter genius that is Catalin Cirjan on loan.

"Been on and off with a Boston United FM22 save. Signed a couple of Arsenal youth players from the ""Teams in Premier League release youth players"" notifcation near the end of every season.

Was able to pick up the likes of James Sweet, Zach Awe, Khayon Edwards, Reull Walters etc.

They helped get me up the leagues to the Championship (where I've been stuck for 4 seasons now - lost the playoff final last season)

While they all have now been sold (for tidy profits), they all helped me out so much getting up the leagues. Very soft spot for those 4 players",Arsenal,Yes,jamhr4c,t1_jam6is7
"I just started my FM career, never played it before, picked it up 2 weeks ago.  
On fifa I always leaned towards arsenal & ex-arsenal players so in the future I most likely will have some stories",Arsenal,Yes,jamno7i,t1_jam6is7

Madrid are literally Barca‚Äôs bitch. How Barca is so bad in Europe is beyond me.,Arsenal,Yes,jaoqe9m,t1_jaohsln

"Has my man ever watched Benzema, or any striker for that matter",Arsenal,Yes,jam80t6,t1_jam6u4s
"This take is going around and it's dividing the fanbase in a good way.  

It all stems on the idea that we wanted players like Vlahovic and that Pep decided Jesus was a winger. You need to occupy the central areas because you need someone there for tap-ins/headers.",Arsenal,Yes,jamax9o,t1_jam6u4s
He never saw Henry or Suarez then.,Arsenal,Yes,jamdvyz,t1_jam6u4s
"What the actual fuck lmao

That's a noncething-level shit take.",Arsenal,Yes,jam7ua1,t1_jam6u4s
"Yeah he doesn't know what he's talking about. It's not a case of do or don't. The best players do what they need to do in that moment, using their experience. It's not different from a striker knowing when to drop deep to help his team to win the ball back",Arsenal,Yes,jam828s,t1_jam6u4s
"what a load of crap lmao. did this person never watch, say, Suarez? or Aguero? or Ronaldo Nazario? just making tweets for the hell of it",Arsenal,Yes,jam7q0t,t1_jam6u4s
"Gotta disagree here. Yes we looked a little more fluid, but we also looked dire for 35 minutes yesterday. Saka's goal was our first actual chance and Martinelli's goal was our second. We were bad in the first half and created fuck all. It is only logical that the game opens up when we are up 2-0.

Nketiah did well when he came on yesterday and he would have offered something similar as Trossard did in the second half. 

I'm not shitting on Trossard, I love him and he has been brilliant. I just think Nketiah has been brilliant aswell and doesn't deserve the 'hate' for our lesser performances when the whole team was just underperforming. Somehow it's all been made out as Nketiah's fault and I won't stand for it.",Arsenal,Yes,jalo163,t1_jalnecs
We created nothing for 40 minutes. Goals were well taken and forced Everton out which led to more space 2nd half. I don't see how you can be sure the issue is fixed.,Arsenal,Yes,jalqc7q,t1_jalnecs
The left side was still shite in the first half. We started playing well when Thomas came on,Arsenal,Yes,jalnm71,t1_jalnecs
They're salty that Arteta will match Klopp's PL trophy tally,Arsenal,Yes,jalvn8h,t1_jalvkk7
Because we could do it on our first attempt. They managed it once out of about 5 goes.,Arsenal,Yes,jalvtmg,t1_jalvkk7
"They finished second twice posting 90+ points losing both times to City by only one point on both occasions.

"Liverpool fans are always hostile, it's the us ageist the world mentality that they have. It's just the way they have been even before Klopp.",Arsenal,Yes,jalxakz,t1_jalvkk7
I mean I was equally hostile to there's. Fairs fair.,Arsenal,Yes,jalvop9,t1_jalvkk7
Quite shameful that they want this City hegemony to continue.,Arsenal,Yes,jalx7em,t1_jalvkk7
My best guess is that Liverpool fans have more friends that support Arsenal than City...as soon as we were out of the running for the title each season I preferred for City to win also because I know 1 City fan! A fan before the money too..Liverpool and United fans are horrible..so I'd imagine they see it the same way,Arsenal,Yes,jam2xuz,t1_jalvkk7
Same reason we didn't like theirs: it's easier to accept a team with the cheats enabled than one that's just sorted their shit out better.,Arsenal,Yes,jamb3o7,t1_jalvkk7

"It was a dumb stance. We get that deal for Suarez over the line and we may well have won the league and think about the trajectory it‚Äôd put us on. 

Instead Liverpool we‚Äôre the ones who rose after that point and we stagnated.",Arsenal,Yes,jaq13dk,t1_japsmgg
"Supposedly, he's been carrying it for some time and just kept playing through it. I think I may have even heard it was an issue even back at City. It's just been managed.

Arsenal just decided to bite the bullet and go for the long-term fix to get it sorted. Similar to Emile's surgery.",Arsenal,Yes,jalqip2,t1_jalqdo6
Yeah. Gotta love how our RB White passed short pass to our LB Zinchenko who played it to our RW Saka while our LW Martinelli was overlapping,Arsenal,Yes,jalu3yn,t1_jalsoub

"Haven't watched them enough to have an opinion, but a reminder that this is the first time these *kids* are playing a full season of men's football. I'd imagine that maintaining consistency is difficult and not surprising that they may be running out of juice a bit",Arsenal,Yes,jamo4g3,t1_jamkklk
"I think we can go toe to toe with our best first team (Partey , Jesus playing). Force City to change how they play, that is honestly how teams have had the most success against City. We've seen that in the CL when Pep tries to gigabrain it. We should be aware though of city using the same tactic again of just lumping it long to Haaland.",Arsenal,Yes,jaor506,t1_jaomit7
I think the game at the Eithad is a whole new prospect with Gabi and Thomas Partey there. That is if it is our best starting 11 being available.,Arsenal,Yes,jaoy7mi,t1_jaomit7

But the race is closer than it looks. ManUre, peaking their nose, yes they are in the title race, Man Shitty probably will try to cheat out one last time. Every game will impact the title race for the top 3. 

Back after many years I've started watching Arsenal games again, Saturday early games are around 4:30 am, I've been watching those as well. And now I don't care if we win or not, Of course I would love us to win but then the team, the way we have been playing, the whole atmosphere and vibe is making me watch Arsenal matches again and I love that feeling. I love this club.",Arsenal,Yes,jaoxz9r,t1_jaou6xh

"That is some next level copium... financially sure, Champions League is important for Spurs (and I'm still not convinced they'll be 4th at the season's end) but Spurs are the laughing stock of English football because they walk around as if they are a top club, but they haven't won a major trophy in decades. No one can begin to tell me that Spurs wouldn't have been jizzing left and right to lift an FA Cup this season, besides the fact that Kane will be out the door soon because Tottenham can't win anything and he doesn't want to end his career with no trophies.",Arsenal,Yes,jam8e3j,t1_jam6crx

"I think Caceido would have had a great impact. He is a more like-for-like sub to Partey. 

However I disagree with a lot of people on here that Mudryk‚Äôs lack of success at Chelsea so far is simply because of poor coaching. He has a lot of bad attributes that will need a lot of work over time.

His first touch is poor, he loses the ball too easily  and his finishing isn‚Äôt great. He definitely would not have had the instant impact Trossard have had.",Arsenal,Yes,jalpzx8,t1_jalndkw

"Liverpool v United is always a different kind of game and last time Newcastle played city it was 3-3.


The way Newcastle are playing now they are set up perfectly to stifle City",Arsenal,Yes,jalm2iw,t1_jallp77
"Liverpool are getting at least a point off United but I‚Äôm not worried about them at all they are irrelevant here.


Newcastle look mentally cooked, I can kinda see them conceding early and the game being a formality but City are playing them at the best possible time which i guess is fair considering we‚Äôve been decently lucky so far this season to play teams when they‚Äôre missing key players",Arsenal,Yes,jallwv2,t1_jallp77
"We face Bournemouth at the Emirates.

You're looking for perfect weekend and you won't get a better one.",Arsenal,Yes,jalr9wu,t1_jallp77
The heat maps of Martinelli and Trossard were identical. Swapping and changing all game made it tough for Everton defenders to keep shape. Jesus was doing the same thing when he was fit.,Arsenal,Yes,jalnj0r,t1_jaln0f2

"how does Saka do what he is currently doing man? 

this guy is so young yet is literally Arsenals best player. that goal yesterday was so so so impressive. not just because of how he took it, turned and shot. but because of how important it was in the moment - we were struggling to get can shots and yet the faker Saka found a way. just insane that guy",Arsenal,Yes,jalvpvb,t1_jalts3x

"Southampton, Bournemouth, Everton",Arsenal,Yes,jan62lq,t1_jan2bcg
"Lads... *Vieira was not a DM*.

He played with Petit and Gilberto as Dm's next to him.

Paddy is the single greatest all round central midfielder I ahve ever seen. Imagine a cross between Partey and Fabregas and you'd get the idea.

The closest player to get to Vieira in promise was Diaby and on the pitch was Yaya Toure.",Arsenal,Yes,jao0c46,t1_jany2nl
"To follow on the very good replies you've already enjoyed...

In comparing them, you really do have to bear in mind the differences in their roles. Vieira was a true CM who played with a lot of freedom and a more defensive midfield partner; Thomas plays as a lone 6 who is more a CM than a DM strictly speaking, but still performs more of the functions of a true DM than Vieira ever did.

Beyond that, imagine if Thomas was the size of Saliba, but with technical facility and ability in the final third closer to ESR (to use contemporary examples). Thomas can do some incredible things on the ball, but Vieira was just on another level. A man that big and powerful should not be able to do what he could with such fluency.

To my mind, Paddy was a superior midfielder, but I'm not sure he would have enjoyed our 6 role much. Thomas is 'merely' a world-class 6, possibly *the* best in the world right now, and one of the very best central midfielders we've had at this club; Vieira was one of the best midfielders ever to play in England.",Arsenal,Yes,jao5j1n,t1_jany2nl
"Vieira was better in most aspects of his game but not by huge margins but Vieira was a better player by a far way overall. Vieira is the best player I‚Äôve seen at Arsenal and Partey isn‚Äôt quite up there.


Partey does have great ability to take a ball on a half turn and beat two guys in a instant with quick feet and smooth hips but Vieira was brilliant at this as well.
I give Partey credit I think he is brilliant and his ‚Äòdisguised‚Äô passing where he looks for all the world like he is passing to x and he pulls it to y is something Vieira didn‚Äôt have in his locker.


Vieira was more aggressive, quicker, better dribbler, better in both boxes from set pieces, better through balls, more skillful, braver, gutsy etc

Partey might pip Patrick on anticipation it‚Äôs uncanny the amount of times Parety intercepts the ball but again Vieira was wonderful at this as well.

I love watching Partey glide around the pitch he is a very special and talented player. 

If we win the league Partey will be the best midfielder to have won it for us ever after Vieira. I think he is that good. A level above Davis, Gilberto, Thomas, Storey, Edu and even Petit.",Arsenal,Yes,jao3d3t,t1_jany2nl
"Let's hope he has a few more, Madrid gets Jude and we get another midfield star from madrid",Arsenal,Yes,jao1jyd,t1_jao05h5
Wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing Vieira get a start tbh.,Arsenal,Yes,jao80t7,t1_jao71yl
Can we give Saka some rest? I'd prefer Trossard on the right over Martinelli.,Arsenal,Yes,jao85t1,t1_jao71yl

"Federico Macheda, Ravel Morrison, Cleverley",Arsenal,Yes,jaq3xew,t1_japwuwq
Every youngster from a big fanbase club is overhyped. But he's still really good and Ten Hag will probably turn him into a 60m+ player at least,Arsenal,Yes,jaqal5z,t1_japwuwq

"They have world class players at  key positions in their prime who bail them out even though their overall play and structure is not elite.
They have a lot of players who are elite in the final third and all are on form right now.
Rashford, Bruno, Antony and now Sancho and garnacho.
Scoring just comes easy to them right now.
It takes the pressure off the mistakes from the rest of the team.

Arsenal rely more on their overall team play and structure to generate scoring chances. It gives us more consistency, but we lose momentum whenever we rotate our starters.",Arsenal,Yes,jan2b6r,t1_jamsk6v
Nothing. Corruption is everywhere,Arsenal,Yes,jao7asc,t1_jao6vcr
"Nothing.

Everyone knew this before. It wasn't a secret. The PL should be absolutely ashamed though.

It's funny that FIFA is against government interference in football but allows nation states to buy teams as well.",Arsenal,Yes,jao7nhj,t1_jao6vcr
Seems like a non story. How is anyone gonna prove anything in Saudi Arabia. They literally killed a journalist in Turkey and nothing happened,Arsenal,Yes,jao8bv7,t1_jao6vcr
"nothing will happen, nothnig new really came out. The PIF is a soverign wealth fund, of course it is controlled/owned by the Saudi government, that's what a SWF is. So not sure what this admission really shows unless the people that run the PL are the most naive people on earth. At least when its like the Qatari Crown prince's brother or whatever there's the slightest bit of deniability that its not government controlled, but the PIF is just owned by the government, that's not a secret or anything or even nefarious in anyway, its just what it is.",Arsenal,Yes,jaoeijh,t1_jao6vcr
"Our pressing won't be the same for every team. Against a team like Brentford, you won't force the ball to Raya as much.

Against Spurs and United, you love when the ball goes back to their goalkeepers.

Every team will have a different approach based on their strengths and weaknesses.",Arsenal,Yes,japx1w0,t1_japtg4c
"Could also be Arteta conserving his energy for sprints, offensive side of the ball, or even the long season.",Arsenal,Yes,japtk3z,t1_japtg4c

Romero is a hard tackle merchant,Arsenal,Yes,jalxc70,t1_jalwxua
"Lisandro, Thiago Silva and Araujo are great defenders, nothing wrong. They don't have to pick Arsenal players, there are a lot of good players outside of Arsenal. Romero definitely doesn't belong in the same category",Arsenal,Yes,jam640v,t1_jalwxua

"Well we all saw KT tried to adapt, which is a very good sign. But we have yet to see he doing an underlap mixing with overlap like White does, which will help our course. Crossing is useless unless it ended with an attempt at goal, it's the same with a cut back or a passing. The trouble is we have a 5'8 Trossard against Everton's 6'4 CBs, if u think the odd is good then I have nothing to say.",Arsenal,Yes,jalouzy,t1_jalo8a0
People still don't understand low crosses amd cutbacks exist apparently.,Arsenal,Yes,jalq7b1,t1_jalo8a0
U might be right but it‚Äôs a huge positive for us that we have that choice,Arsenal,Yes,jamuali,t1_jamsm39
"KT should stay, he was monumental in our previous seasons. Players do get injured, and we should have plenty of games had we not exit FA cup and Carabao cup early. Next season we will even have tougher fixtures with CL. KT should definitely stay.",Arsenal,Yes,jan1scl,t1_jamsm39
"That period under lampard where he was hot fire, he was moving like his uncle jay jay.",Arsenal,Yes,jamnphm,t1_jamj8f5

More than just a chance.,Arsenal,Yes,jaomf6i,t1_jaocbyt
"Fulham I'm not sure, Liverpool at the back at a mess. I think they'll try raise intensity though again and we'll need to be prepared for that. If we can win the midfield, I think our forwards tear their backline apart. Newcastle I'm hoping just continue to drift off to the point they actually need to try and beat us to make CL. They can't just try to terrorball their way to a 0-0 again.",Arsenal,Yes,jaorh9r,t1_jaocbyt
"Chelsea at home for me. I know, I know. But for a while now I've been feeling an upset. Every star has aligned for us to smash them.

Also City. Now that we lost at home we must win there. We had two good first halves, but in the second couldn't react to Pep's changes. Hopefully Arteta learned from those otherwise we're toast.

Anfield is Anfield.",Arsenal,Yes,jaqeiya,t1_jaocbyt

Xhaka or √òdegaard. With Jesus and Nelson back we're stacked in the front three.,Arsenal,Yes,jallsiy,t1_jall8xp
Emile got roughly 10 minutes on the pitch so not a lot of time to shine. He was doing 1-2‚Äôs and making nice looking runs but not getting the overhead/through ball to him. He looked comfortable on the ball but last night was just a formality to get him back into the rhythm I think. Definitely looking forward to having our #10 as an option again.,Arsenal,Yes,jalqezv,t1_jalp5i8
"Don't fix if it's working. My only change would be Partey starting.

"Thomas could play 90, but he also clearly, on the strength of yesterday, doesn't need the minutes for sharpness. He's there already.

I'd start Jorginho; it's Bournemouth, and part of the reason we got him was so Thomas could put his feet up in these situations, and save himself for stronger competition.",Arsenal,Yes,jam34jh,t1_jam0vqp
"I'd like Vieira, Tomi, and KT to get significant minutes.  It's unrealistic to expect these guys to be 100% off the blocks in the EL if they don't have a run in.",Arsenal,Yes,jam2gus,t1_jam0vqp

Could be onto something. People was saying no to rashford when he was being linked to us and even United fans where saying sell him.,Arsenal,Yes,jamzrbx,t1_jamvoze
"I wouldn't mind getting him at all. He's better than Fabio and ESR at the moment. He's only 24 and he's already won Chelsea player of the year twice. He's clearly shown he can do it at the highest stage. He's out of form and in typical Chelsea fashion, he's been scapegoated for their struggles as they are all about their shiny new toys.

The problem is he will not start over Odegaard and I doubt he wants to rotate. The idea of ESR going on to become that player himself is a lot more exciting too.",Arsenal,Yes,janeobl,t1_jamvoze
Kimmich is probably the only other fullback in the world who can excel as a midfielder.,Arsenal,Yes,jallth5,t1_jallqc6

"Their ownership is a gigantic, gigantic mess.

"Trossard attracts defenders in like flies and allows martinelli a lot more room to cut inside and dribble. The goals might not have had much to do with leo but martinelli was just so much better as a whole last night and that was 100% on leo.

As much as I love Eddie, you're deluding yourself if you think martinelli plays as well as he did with eddie starting.",Arsenal,Yes,jalpna0,t1_jalp5x7
"Eddie saw what was needed and adjusted so good on him but for the couple matches before he got dropped he was just standing on the opposite back post most of the time leaving the left isolated.

I truly doubt Arteta told the players to stop rotating when Eddie came in. That just isn‚Äôt him game naturally so it didn‚Äôt happen.",Arsenal,Yes,jalqclr,t1_jalp5x7
"MartinelliPropagandist?? 

Yeah I think the best use of Martinelli is him rotating with one of the wingers/striker and coming centrally more often. His movement in the box is very promising, always has been.",Arsenal,Yes,jalqv87,t1_jalp5x7
"agreed, martinelli played up front more than trossard did yesterday imo. what people meant when they said martinelli is missing jesus is that he missed the rotation of left wing and striker, not necessarily that jesus is the one making him play well",Arsenal,Yes,jalr8a3,t1_jalp5x7

He looks short on confidence. His decision making in the final third has fallen off of a cliff lately,Arsenal,Yes,janjsoz,t1_jan3bz7
"I see what you‚Äôre saying. May be it‚Äôs because of our system, players know where their team mates are and if they‚Äôre in a position to cover/ tackle. So they know that even if they let a player past them at that point, they are still in control. So their decision making has improved from the sense that they are not rushing into silly fouls and tackles. Eg: Yesterday, Partey was closed down after the 4th goal but he was aware that Big Gabi was behind him so he just fell (of course drew the foul).",Arsenal,Yes,janymxg,t1_jan3bz7
"Get a grip. Nothing was off about his game, he played very well, worked hard to track back and made a lot of tackles.

People were saying stuff like ""Buy Raphinha to be Saka back up"". Like, who do you think you are to have Raphinha waiting for 20 minute cameos. 

So, Tierney wants to move. Next up could be Tomi. 

Players like Kiwior and Holding won't because that's just what depth usually is for clubs like ours. Even that isn't a safe bet as Lokonga tried to leave.",Arsenal,Yes,japnfw7,t1_jap1he7
"If you‚Äôre talking about stars aligning, it has to be Leeds 0-1 Arsenal. We didn‚Äôt create much, Leeds missed sitters, missed a penalty, heroic defending from Gabriel. THAT was a game only champions can win.",Arsenal,Yes,jam4ws4,t1_jam4cy0

"> in the mould of Zinchenko

This is much easier said than done.  If Zinchenko represents some kind of archetype, then we would need to convert a midfielder.  Buy Zubimendi and play him at RB would be as close as you'd get.  Alternatively, play Thomas as a RB (he's done it before).  

If you are looking for a fullback in the mould of Zinchenko, you aren't looking for a fullback.",Arsenal,Yes,jantdtf,t1_janpp4y
"Tomi has to play CB, he‚Äôs an easy pressing trigger when he‚Äôs at full back (plus he‚Äôs a good CB). Fresneda will be the RB brought in. I think Zinny, Tavares on his last chance (an overlapping FB option is a must imo), sousa and Kiwior (I think he could do it) is enough for LB.

Rice is a must buy for me. Super athlete. With his ability to cover large spaces as the 6 we can afford to play a 10 profile in the LCM role, Fabio V is growing every game. I‚Äôm of the same opinion of Xhaka, think we‚Äôd miss his duel winning and engine. Caicedo is probably the happy medium of retaining some of Xhaka‚Äôs defensive contributions but adding far superior turning radius, technical ability, ability to receive  ahead of the ball. Signing an 8 is a lower priority for me unless there‚Äôs a can‚Äôt miss market opportunity (Bellingham is the one but it‚Äôll never happen). Patino will break through soon, Lewis-Skelly looks special & if Nwaneri stays that‚Äôs a lot of players in and around that role. 

I don‚Äôt think we explicitly need a RW. Jesus & Trossard can both play there so a LW isn‚Äôt out of the question. Leao being the obvious one. I think Balogun being sold with a buy back clause is what will happen, I‚Äôve not seen enough of him to pick between him & Nketiah (I‚Äôm very happy with Eddie as the backup option). I wouldn‚Äôt buy a ST as there‚Äôs a few in the Hale end pipeline plus Martinelli is destined for a move to the centre.",Arsenal,Yes,janwp89,t1_janpp4y
Fans like you are unbelievable. Odegaard makes this team tick and with his relentless pressing hes undroppable. You guys wants us to dominate games like we are playing u18s what morw do you want from him? He gets double teamed every time he gets the ball and btw teams are playing low block against us every single time theres literally no space to pass into even KDB struggles against teama like Everton.,Arsenal,Yes,jaln07g,t1_jallhsb
There are not many things u could do if opponents double or sometimes triple up on u in the first 45 minutes. All he need is a lapse in concentration.,Arsenal,Yes,jalm0lh,t1_jallhsb

Allison > Raya,Arsenal,Yes,jam39rc,t1_jam2rc2
"I'd definitely take Thomas over Casemiro, and I'd have to agree with those arguing for Alisson over Raya.

I think Martinelli has genuinely been better than Rashford all season; even with Rashford's crazy run of form and Martinelli being nailed to the sideline on our stagnating left, he could well end up with more PL goals than Rashford this season, and he does so much more for us. That said, I would have to acknowledge my heart was holding some sway in this.

I do love, though, how including Martinez beside Zinchenko vindicates both our interest in Martinez and our decision to go with Zinchenko. Martinez would have given us a very balanced backline with him and White as our FBs; Zinchenko is an animal so different he's almost unique.",Arsenal,Yes,jam97l4,t1_jam2rc2

"We had cheap smart signings under Wenger given where we used to finish, and also relative to what our immediate rivals used to spend. Matter fact, that was his superpower. His most expensive purchase was Mesut Ozil( Auba started the Raul era).

Arteta keeps telling us this as well. And still we are like ""when can we rest him?""

I dunno why it's taking so long for people to understand this. 

Furthermore I don't think there's any evidence that playing lots of games can burn out someone's career. 

It's just something we like to say.

Guess I find it most tough seeing United succeed, purely because their support is so ubiquitous that it's impossible to avoid...

They aren't competing with us lmao FSG are one of the worst owners in sports.,Arsenal,Yes,janw1vw,t1_janvi0o
Zinchenko walked out of there because of that.,Arsenal,Yes,jaly4e7,t1_jalxh6z
Honestly can't see us buying Cancelo. Like who would we play as left back in that case? Think we'll just use Tomi as backup to Zinchenko if KT were to go.,Arsenal,Yes,jalyjoh,t1_jalxh6z
Might as well try for Davies if we‚Äôre spending Cancelo money,Arsenal,Yes,jalzg74,t1_jalxh6z
Rather have Henry and Bergkamp if we are just picking random players from history,Arsenal,Yes,jaqctqc,t1_jaq6oj3
Could make his own legacy at New Balance,Arsenal,Yes,jan1o73,t1_jan0k6h
"He suits the Vibe at NB in my opinion. He needs something like the ""Board Man Gets Paid"" t-shirt they gave Kawhi Leonard",Arsenal,Yes,jan5gqq,t1_jan0k6h
New Balance was the best move for Saka from a brand perspective. Better to be one of the few people wearing their boots than one of a thousand wearing Nike,Arsenal,Yes,jan6zcj,t1_jan0k6h
"Disagree, hes the face for an entire brand whereas at Nike or Adidas he‚Äôd be competing with every other star footballer",Arsenal,Yes,jan9tty,t1_jan0k6h
Only thing that matters is the ¬£,Arsenal,Yes,jan2nj7,t1_jan0k6h
"They're making a big push to get in the game, so it makes sense to try and keep a top young talent. About a decade ago in North America the same happened with Under Armour. They signed the best young athletes in their sports; Cam Newton (NFL) Jordan Spieth (PGA) Bryce Harper (MLB) and Steph Curry (Steph Curry) Without those moves they're bankrupt by now. I hope they throw Saka an absolute bag, but I'd love to see him in a Nike ad

Sorry, that was a lot",Arsenal,Yes,jan45af,t1_jan0k6h

"I could see Flo getting another loan at at CL level team. Don't think we'll sell Eddie one year after his extension if mad money isn't offered.

A four nil win showed that we need to do better?,Arsenal,Yes,janf7uq,t1_jan7c0a
"We broke through in 40mins.

That's good when a match still has 50mins to play....

What are you on about?",Arsenal,Yes,jan8oe7,t1_jan7c0a
">some teams don't lose that concentration or other days we aren't at our best which is where we need to punish them more.

Any team that can do that for 90 minutes isn't being beat. City and Liverpool didn't break through with systematic beat downs each time, they spend money on players who can pull something out of their ass in desperate times and just have the mentality to keep pushing til they grab a winner.

Liverpool have had their keeper score to earn points, City basically won a league thanks to a 30 yard screamer from their CB. We've shown that we can break down buses because we've won so many games against them this season.",Arsenal,Yes,janaqm0,t1_jan7c0a
"Most teams also don‚Äôt set up in a 4-5-1 like Everton do under Dyche. Yh the first 40 minutes were a bit meh, but most teams have set up in a deep block against us this season and we‚Äôve broke them down most of the time

The way we moved around our front 3 plus our midfielders all pushing up into different areas made Everton confused. Plus Newcastle who play similarly to Everton will be more expansive at home when we play them later",Arsenal,Yes,janc3n0,t1_jan7c0a
"When you‚Äôre at the top, you have to constantly adapt to new tactics from opposing managers. We‚Äôre slowly getting the hang of playing against disciplined defenses that target our dangerous wingers. The first goal was a perfect illustration of players rotating to overload one side and creating a gap for Zinchenko to find Saka in behind. We need more of that and I‚Äôm sure this is being worked on in training. The important thing is to get the belief back to where it was and I think yesterday helped massively to get over the game at Goodison Park.",Arsenal,Yes,jancytx,t1_jan7c0a
17 wins we‚Äôve done ok this season. Yes not perfect but it‚Äôs not like teams have figured us out.,Arsenal,Yes,jan7yko,t1_jan7c0a
Vieira has earned a start for sure would like to see him at the #8 spot and start Partey as well,Arsenal,Yes,jalkrjw,t1_jalkhfj
Partey and Vieira should come in.,Arsenal,Yes,jalknh9,t1_jalkhfj
"It was lively at first but then you could sense the tension. In the second half, it was a party atmosphere.

There seemed to be a lot of empty seats, at least in the lower level, was that the case?",Arsenal,Yes,jalmytc,t1_jalmbkc
"I hear that Sporting employs the same annoying low block as Everton. Want to see our subs play this tie, they need to show they can overcome a challenge like that",Arsenal,Yes,jalsvzx,t1_jalspem
"They are currently 4th five points behind Braga, so it has been pretty bad season for them so far.",Arsenal,Yes,jalu0z6,t1_jalspem

Either Kiwi or Holding,Arsenal,Yes,janqa92,t1_janp0dg
"Now that I think of this, Chelsea are that insane. 

It would take a flashier LW being available for them to try and edit Mudryk out of the XI. Then because of the price tag, they would try to force him into the team in a position that's just not for him...like say, LWB.",Arsenal,Yes,jalo1sv,t1_jaln75y
"I guess they might wait to see how he is with another coach before making a decision on him, if Potter gets the sack. It's too soon to write him off.",Arsenal,Yes,jalngzq,t1_jaln75y

I agree we‚Äôre gunning for the title and that is the aim. But on the other hand I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wrong to say if we come second that‚Äôs not failure.,Arsenal,Yes,jam06vd,t1_jalvfdr

"Holy shit you're right. Our last CL game against Bayern I was 11 and in year 6. Now I'm in year 12 and learning to drive, assuming we qualify I'll be in year 13 and maybe with a driving licence when we play our first game back. Crazy to think about.",Arsenal,Yes,janag8g,t1_jam4jl6
Pope can have a clean sheet on that game. I really wouldn't mind that at all to be honest.,Arsenal,Yes,jam2e9a,t1_jalz0ro
"I can see where they‚Äôre coming from though, both of those had raw attributes similar to Martinelli, Walcott probably didn‚Äôt have the drive or mentality but Ox had huge potential and could have been world class imo. Injuries were obviously mostly to blame for his career trajectory but I also think he would have been much better under Arteta than he was under Wenger.

He had an elite combination of pace and strength with a powerful shot and very good technique. He struggled a lot with decision making (just like Martinelli used to), and Wengers ‚Äúexpress yourself‚Äù mantra really isn‚Äôt beneficial to those types of players. If he was drilled into Artetas system I think we could have had a real player there",Arsenal,Yes,jamt4yc,t1_jampbjy
"That‚Äôs just crazy tbh. People still call him doginelli too which is not only childish, but incredibly disrespectful given his performances recently.",Arsenal,Yes,jan0iam,t1_jamrj1r
They all think that Simple Jack lookin mf'er is the best young player in the world lmao,Arsenal,Yes,jannow8,t1_jannfee
Them thinking their CBs are better than our CBs pisses me off more than it should.,Arsenal,Yes,janywqp,t1_jannfee
foden fc have also been very insufferable,Arsenal,Yes,jant3kr,t1_jannfee

"I feel like the biggest asset we have is that we have shown uniform development across all of our young talent on a consistent basis, and these players still have some clear deficiencies that they only seem closed to ironing out as well. And then we have squad deficiencies and still a fairly small squad which has room for additions, which we have been very consistent with in recruiting quality. Things look exceptionally positive for us.",Arsenal,Yes,jann593,t1_janlx95

The Martinelli hate recently has just been embarrassing tbh,Arsenal,Yes,jam8pko,t1_jam8ibh
"I think this team has to be the best just because of the defense/GK.

why isn't it?  It's not like anyone in Europe is miles better than us and we mostly have the depth to cope now plus any new faces in the summer....  If our aim isn't to win it then who are we scared of?,Arsenal,Yes,jampytw,t1_jam7cuz
"Correct. Almost no-one comes out of nowhere to win it first go (or rather first go in a while). Last team I can think of to do so was Mourinho's Porto almost 20 years previously, and they'd won Europa the year before.

"I never felt like we'd do it in 13/14. We had City/Chelsea breathing down our necks all season and Ramsey, who was in the form of his life, couldn't stay fit. Our collapse was inevitable. I'll be devastated if we don't win it this time.",Arsenal,Yes,jan2ndt,t1_jan16pz

"That United game was incredible. Nobody‚Äôs hotter than United since the World Cup break and yet I never believed for a second‚Äîeven when we went down 0-1 and 1-2‚Äìthat we would lose or even tie.

"no, we are saving that title for kane‚Äôs biopic",Arsenal,Yes,jamkkv8,t1_jamhzm7

"I couldn't believe we were able to sign Odegaard. If anyone in 2019 told you we would, it would shock you.

"At the book I predominantly use United are 3.5, Arsenal 4, Juve 8.",Arsenal,Yes,jaltk2d,t1_jaltcfr
"A lot of players could replace Xhaka, but not very many could replace Zinny and his unique role, that‚Äôs why I specified that position.",Arsenal,Yes,jaoc7ak,t1_jaoa4z6
"Exactly. I remember in the first half of the season, fans wouldn‚Äôt stop singing even when we were losing. The reaction to that Saliba own goal comes to mind.

With the expectation of winning the league now, the atmosphere has become really tense. Everyone is talking about the atmosphere last night, but it was comparatively quiet up until the first goal.",Arsenal,Yes,jalncox,t1_jaln2of

Would be an interesting decision to drop our top goal scorer‚Ä¶,Arsenal,Yes,jann0ft,t1_janmbok
"Disagree, they both have different qualities. Trossard has better ball control, decision making (football iq), long shot, left foot, passing range and versatility. Martinelli is faster, probably slightly better finisher, more direct, better header.

Imo trossard at this age is a better overall player, but martinelli is still so young so time will tell if he becomes a worldbeater.",Arsenal,Yes,janizo2,t1_jangb07
Trossard has 100x the technical ability of Martinelli,Arsenal,Yes,jani14q,t1_jangb07
"Not counting him out whatsoever - just curious how others see Jesus, Trossard & Saka working together.

*39,Arsenal,Yes,japxz5n,t1_japs8su
"Good move pouncing on those released players. I've had Reuell Walters before, love me a good fullback. I try to focus on our academy players as well, don't know if I could live with myself if I signed like, Saliba or even Reiss.

Half the time I just use the editor to keep topping up Saka's contract and making him dislike teams like City or PSG (which inevitably go in for him on every single one of my saves).",Arsenal,Yes,jamjvao,t1_jamhr4c
"Doesn't have to be the striker. Doesn't have to be the same player each attack either. This is what I mean about knowing and understanding the principles of positonal play.

In Peps times he's used Messi F9, Henry, Etoo, Villa wide, Haaland as a poacher, Foden Sterling etc as wide/backpost poachers.

ETH same principles has used big target men like Weghorst and Haller, F9s like Tadic and Rashy who's a versatile forward who will drift wide.

As long as you understand and follow that you can tweak and vary your game dependent on player strengths and mismatches you wanna emphasise

EDIT - I think it's Jesus scoring that meant he was pushed wide. Didn't handle the pressure well but has grown since.",Arsenal,Yes,jamfp6y,t1_jamax9o
People on this sub swear by this account too,Arsenal,Yes,jam7rz7,t1_jam7q0t
"But Saka's goal came from Martinelli and Zinchenko coming over to the right. Look at this [screenshot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqLDCY_WcAEf5Rw?format=jpg&name=large) and see how Everton were static and in the same shape and how our guys rotating from the other side created chaos and opened up space. It's quite funny how all of Trossard, Odegaard, Saka and Martinelli are asking for the ball.",Arsenal,Yes,jalpiys,t1_jalo163
"I don't think either of you are wrong, but I will agree on the fact that with Trossard's play through the middle, Martinelli finally has sparked some of his old form back. Against low block teams, playing Eddie isn't quite the answer, but when the games more open (like the second half of Everton) I like having the option to bring on Eddie when needed.",Arsenal,Yes,jaloyer,t1_jalo163
"U must understand critism doesn't mean 'hate'. Nketiah is our boy why should we hate him? It's clear we want him to add something to his game which is lacking at the moment. He has to earn his place just like every others, this is a brutal business only fittest survives.",Arsenal,Yes,jalpkhu,t1_jalo163
"Wrong. We were probing non stop. Once we connect one final ball we opened up the game. Everton was forced to come forward, that's make our life much easier.",Arsenal,Yes,jalnqsp,t1_jalnm71

"Yup I only have one liverpool friend who‚Äôs a serious fan and damn he was so annoying about it. Cheered for man city all the way

Sad the way man city got all their players/money since it directly affected us. But my friends annoying attitude towards liverpool and me and my friends team (newcastle for the friend) made us want to see liverpool lose. Now what a season it‚Äôs been for our dynamic",Arsenal,Yes,jamcjxa,t1_jam2xuz

"Tottenham is currently the bar to reach 4th as they have the 5th best potential points in the league. They can reach 84 maximum.

Getting to 85 is 25 points from the remaining 39, 8 wins and a draw.

Yeah I feel Xhaka could do with a rest. Bournemouth might be the sort of side we can afford to play someone a bit more lightweight like Vieira in that role. Also wouldn't mind Tomi getting a run over White.,Arsenal,Yes,jao9j56,t1_jao80t7
Saka a rest? My FPL says otherwise lmao. I was thinking Xhaka could do with a rest. I like the idea of starting Partey and Jorginho or giving Vieira more minutes.,Arsenal,Yes,jao94j7,t1_jao85t1

i don't even know what to say to that tbh

> The trouble is we have a 5'8 Trossard against Everton's 6'4 CBs

we don't play everton every week and trossard isn't our striker every week. plus who says you have to cross to the striker anyway being marked by big cbs? trent and robertson cross all the time and for years liverpool didn't have anyone in their front line over 6ft",Arsenal,Yes,jalpfko,t1_jalouzy
Yeah love to Tierney does that. Rare I must say.,Arsenal,Yes,jalqwqe,t1_jalq7b1

Let's see what we actually have in these players, keep the regular starters on the bench in case of emergency but that squad should be good enough to at least get a draw against Sporting.",Arsenal,Yes,jam2x5r,t1_jam1dgf

Lloris' dad is Spanish/Monegasque, the Hernandez brothers have a spanish dad too and everyone else is second or third generation African or Arabic. It's honestly one of the best examples of french multiculturalism out there.

Having said that it's a bit problematic, how do you measure 'french'.",Arsenal,Yes,janhnad,t1_jana5gw
Isn‚Äôt Mpabbe French? Born and raised Bondy so more than 3-4,Arsenal,Yes,janj2wp,t1_jana5gw
Probably not the reason why but thank you for the info nonetheless. Was reading a piece talking about his ancestry that made me assume his family were more recent immigrants.,Arsenal,Yes,jancweh,t1_janb4es
"I think thats the point the poster is trying to make, French players of African decent have a lot more scrutiny over their supposed frenchness. Why does Griezmann not get questioned, it might have something to do with him being white.",Arsenal,Yes,jannfg8,t1_janf280
probably because the lion's share of his football development took place in Spain  with Real Sociedad. I know some of you transfer saga OG's remember the links to us back in the day when he was still there in San Sebasti√°n.,Arsenal,Yes,janmqey,t1_janf280
is he that borderline retarded liverpool fan?,Arsenal,Yes,jamycz0,t1_jammjs6
So‚Ä¶ rescind jinx?,Arsenal,Yes,jan1wjn,t1_jan1ru2
anulo pendejo,Arsenal,Yes,jan67wh,t1_jan0ew6
Denilson was so good Wenger didn't want to sign Xabi Alonso. Glory days.,Arsenal,Yes,jao1ej5,t1_jao0fx2
I don‚Äôt know if it is. Have you read one of our match threads?,Arsenal,Yes,jaotwmr,t1_jaoppuq
"Agree to disagree. As I said, not sure how it‚Äôs deluded to suggest that Martinelli can play well with Eddie up front when Eddie literally assisted him for the fourth goal.",Arsenal,Yes,jalq3by,t1_jalpna0
"And I really hope everyone noticed that.

Specifically, that both of Martinelli's goals *and* Saka's goal involved him operating as a striker, and in the latter (first) case, skewing so far right that he was outside Saka.",Arsenal,Yes,jam20da,t1_jalr8a3
"They're just being precious of their own academy star. And that's natural.

Just as many of us think Foden is a gigantic overrated twatball who is only given the praise he is because a) it's City and b) he's white. Both of these may be true, but really we hate him because c) he gets the praise over Saka.",Arsenal,Yes,jalswyw,t1_jalr4zs
I don't think it's weird. People hate good players of rival teams. I hate Rashford but I think to neutrals he is very likeable,Arsenal,Yes,jalsp8w,t1_jalr4zs
They're salty that Saka is better,Arsenal,Yes,jaltf7k,t1_jalr4zs
"It‚Äôs just pure jealousy that we have a younger, more consistent and WC career prospect in Saka compared to Rashford. Lots of dumb Man United fans around the world seeing and seething that we are top of the league with the best RW currently and probably will be for some time. Just pure jealousy lmao.",Arsenal,Yes,jalu16t,t1_jalr4zs
Now I do.  I'm gonna leave this here though.,Arsenal,Yes,jaojzeo,t1_jaojm9n
Yeah neither do I now that I remember ü§£,Arsenal,Yes,jaojt04,t1_jaojj7o
They do in FIFA CM üòõ,Arsenal,Yes,japyxoe,t1_japxilf
"Fair point, maybe then just a good option if we were to sell Tierney.",Arsenal,Yes,japy6k3,t1_japxilf
"> Get a grip

This is literally a post where you write opinions, so no need to be a cunt. You could also argue that watching only their chances and seeing him pop up in most of them says something? He's one of my favorite players ever, so I'm always paying attention. This fucking sub, man",Arsenal,Yes,jan71jm,t1_jan6e96
You‚Äôve got a point but Holdings only 27.,Arsenal,Yes,japnmne,t1_japnfw7
"I don't disagree, we're essentially looking for a mid that can also play right back for that and such players are basically unicorns. I also do believe that White can go much further in that role than most and our right back side is basically settled. Maybe the ideal could be adding left side White instead if Tierney wants to move on, and that sounds more achievable.",Arsenal,Yes,janudla,t1_jantdtf
Llorente maybe?,Arsenal,Yes,jaods8n,t1_jantdtf
"Calm down. I am only suggesting where he can improve, not asking Arteta to drop him to the reserves. And I am fully aware of the difficulties of playing against a low block, he can do even better because he has done better and he is capable of it. 

You think a 24yo is at the peak of his powers and can't develop even further?",Arsenal,Yes,jalnq69,t1_jaln07g
"Calm down, lad. He just made the point that √òdegaard can still develop his ability to dictate games in the fist half as brilliantly well as he does second halves. No one says he's shit or should be dropped.",Arsenal,Yes,jalnyc0,t1_jaln07g
Exactly. He's still more experienced than most out there when it comes to avoiding relegation. At the end of the day he still knows the squad better than anyone else so you're not gonna see much change to turn things around drastically.,Arsenal,Yes,jalr1cr,t1_jalps4g
"Yeah it does but individually I can‚Äôt really see any good performers other than the cyborg. Rodri has been well below his level this season, Partey and Cas miles ahead. 

Three United players is a lot, tbf you could take Martinez out for Botman or Saliba",Arsenal,Yes,jam39lh,t1_jam30vl
"Taking Thomas out is-- interesting.

He's been better than both Casemiro and Rodri.",Arsenal,Yes,jam4py8,t1_jam40e0
People probably disagreeing. I dont think we would have competed but easily gotten a trophy or 2 during the drought,Arsenal,Yes,japwhuh,t1_japisdi
"Don't really care about what others talk about, I'm talking personal opinion here.

Its not like I'm constantly slating partey or won't celebrate anything he's involved with or anything, it's just conflicting in my mind when I think about the whole situation. I just hope justice is served either way tbh",Arsenal,Yes,jan9nrm,t1_jan5387
Even 5 minutes as a sub though,Arsenal,Yes,jam9q9k,t1_jam9otc
"With teams like Liverpool & Chelsea, the quality is obviously there, it's all about timing. Will they be in form when we play them or not?

Look at Newcastle, they were in formidable defensive form before our home game but things have changed and now I expect City to Spank them this weekend.",Arsenal,Yes,jaoek9r,t1_jaoc4wp
"GW38 with the title at stake still and us needing City to drop points would be horrible though, we all know they'd pull something mad out of the bag and win it. Wish that game was sooner, especially because Toney will be banned for it too.",Arsenal,Yes,jaobqif,t1_jao9zw6
Martinelli has more expected assists (5.81) than Bukayo Saka (5.21),Arsenal,Yes,jals41n,t1_jalqzms
"For my money, it's Saka or Partey. Both are top 3 ITW for their positions.",Arsenal,Yes,jam4onz,t1_jalz0i9
And Partey and Gabriel and Jesus,Arsenal,Yes,jalw2a7,t1_jalu1jg
"Easy games like bournemouth are the perfect way to integrate a new signing into  getting playtime, not an away European knockout even if it has lesser importance. If Kiwior starting means that our chances to win against Bournemouth reduces drastically then he wouldn‚Äôt have been signed in the first place, he‚Äôs going to get plenty of gametime from next season",Arsenal,Yes,jamhh1k,t1_jamg85x
Realistically who?,Arsenal,Yes,jamj618,t1_jamffzg
"We‚Äôve played amazingly with xhaka in our team who has even lesser technical quality, we‚Äôll be fine with mount. I‚Äôll prefer Mac Allister or Bellingham but if we can‚Äôt get them then Mount would be good",Arsenal,Yes,jami29g,t1_jamf0ky
Yeah he'd start LCM for me. Has played LW RW and 9 so will be reslly comfortable with the attacking rotations we ask of those in the forward 5 line.,Arsenal,Yes,jallc2i,t1_jall85q
World class guy but injury record is horrendous,Arsenal,Yes,jallips,t1_jallhhf
Nope. Talent emerges when shits hit rock bottom. Hes so average in every facet of the game thats why you think hes gonna cook because you think he doesnt have any weaknesses but the truth is he doesnt have any strengths at all.,Arsenal,Yes,jaln7s5,t1_jallhf3
"Happy to hear different opinion. 

I feel like he‚Äôs been unsure of himself recently. Had some sloppy play, whether making the wrong pass or just not being in sync with the front four movement. Unlike the start of the season where he was an integral part of the attacking play. Yesterday, particularly in the first half, I felt like he was getting caught out a lot and their attacks came down his side",Arsenal,Yes,jalqh85,t1_jalorzx
I‚Äôm sure at the start of the season he was overlapping more though? Thought Zinny is the inverted fullback while White stays wide,Arsenal,Yes,jalqkfs,t1_jalpyp7
sums up his season,Arsenal,Yes,jamml25,t1_jamf4iv
He's better but Chelsea won't sell anyways yes.,Arsenal,Yes,jan3yqp,t1_jan3j6v
Only difficult game with respect to form/standing is Newcastle who they‚Äôve already beat,Arsenal,Yes,jap31qq,t1_jap2ym3
I'm glad I was in school with several gooners and virtually no Spurs fans. But then I am from West London. Half these guys were Chelsea and QPR.,Arsenal,Yes,jam1iez,t1_jalw1lw
"Lol how did he miss a sitter against west ham by out jumping villa defenders?

Nah I agree wasn‚Äôt close to a sitter, but I think you mean villa park not west ham.",Arsenal,Yes,jam0gis,t1_jalw1s7
That's fair enough,Arsenal,Yes,jamk697,t1_jamk1t1
TAA,Arsenal,Yes,jao10nk,t1_janzxjj
Harry Kewell was a Liverpool fan. Unless a player is a Liverpool fan they have no reason to join them over us this Summer. And Declan Rice definitely is no Liverpool fan.,Arsenal,Yes,janxxru,t1_janx4z7
That is factually false.,Arsenal,Yes,janx2jv,t1_janw1vw
They seem to think Rice is an option for them when it has been made clear he is one of our top targets for the Summer.,Arsenal,Yes,janws9a,t1_janw1vw
I hope they keep on giving him special colorways like his current red boots,Arsenal,Yes,jan2poi,t1_jan1o73
"I do, I'm sure others do as well",Arsenal,Yes,jan28ih,t1_jan1z1f
"Come on my dude, you've been on this planet long enough to know how to properly look at a game. With your vast experience surely you can look at something more critically?",Arsenal,Yes,janfe4j,t1_janf7uq
"And we struggled massively in those 40 minutes, creating nothing.",Arsenal,Yes,jan9r3l,t1_jan8oe7
"No, of course not, any team vying for a title needs a considerable amount of fortune but there were many occasions of City beating down teams looking to take what they can and shut up shop.",Arsenal,Yes,janb7mu,t1_janaqm0
"Deep block is just one facet of the entire system made to neutralise our space in the 2-3-5. Credit to Howe, he created a system well-designed to mitigate an already amazing system.",Arsenal,Yes,jand25k,t1_janc3n0
Yep I have no doubts that this is something Arteta is working on because it's clearly the only real weakness we have at the moment. Once we can get over this stumbling block then I think we are going to be one of the best run clubs from a tactical standpoint in the world.,Arsenal,Yes,jandbkg,t1_jancytx
"Teams are starting to and it's naive to pretend like it's going to be plain sailing from here. 

Newcastle showed teams how to do it and not it's about the application.",Arsenal,Yes,jan88us,t1_jan7yko
*FA Cup Winner Matt Smith - who also hasn't been named in a team since January.,Arsenal,Yes,janpp5x,t1_janp8jl
"I agree it‚Äôs too early to put him in the bin. However, this is a club that just seems to sign players for the sake of it and the squad is far too big already. 

I‚Äôm shocked they didn‚Äôt give Levi Colwill a chance this season and now they have signed two players ahead of him. Colwill will go down as another stupid sale by Chelsea in a few years time when they inevitably sell him this summer.",Arsenal,Yes,jalnp50,t1_jalngzq
God that film was excellent,Arsenal,Yes,jalqk7b,t1_jalqfd2
All their players are better than ours and our soon to be 14 point lead over them is just imaginary,Arsenal,Yes,janzmzs,t1_janywqp
there‚Äôs not enough of them to even matter,Arsenal,No,janvnwj,t1_jant3kr
that‚Äôs what u get for looking at twitter for that kinda shit lol. who‚Äôs rantsandbants?,Arsenal,Yes,janp4kl,t1_jannw1q
"i mean this just isn‚Äôt true. whilst zinchenko is brilliant and probably our best player, tied with saka if anything, he‚Äôs playing a very similar role to what cancelo had last season just with less goal threat.",Arsenal,Yes,jaot7mx,t1_jaorhi8
"They didn‚Äôt know they‚Äôd be struggling at the position now, and he‚Äôd been a good servant for Pep.",Arsenal,Yes,jaotrk0,t1_jaorhi8
Yeah not saying the Pep of today would necessarily react the same but more an interesting evolution of playing styles from his early Barca days where he expected his players to stick rigidly to his plans. Now his former assistant manager plays a style with a similar philosophy but essentially has this wildcard left back and it still works.,Arsenal,Yes,jaouhth,t1_jaotk59
If they're desperate in May draws won't be an option....,Arsenal,Yes,jan1dvd,t1_jan0pva
but when we're actually good both on and off the field as a club we usually win two or 3 titles in a short period.  I mean that's the same for most well run teams.,Arsenal,Yes,janje73,t1_jani8wd
We're not in the banter era anymore,Arsenal,Yes,janlqt0,t1_jani8wd
The failure to understand both his quality and our tactics is baffling.,Arsenal,Yes,jamajz5,t1_jam8pko
He clearly doesn't work as well with Nketiah and this needs to be worked on or worked around by Arteta.,Arsenal,Yes,jambwz4,t1_jam8pko
So you are telling me we just gotta win Europa this year first? Bet.,Arsenal,Yes,jamkegr,t1_jamgixl
"> Almost no-one comes out of nowhere to win it first go (or rather first go in a while).

I'd argue this is because its insanely rare for a team who wasn't in CL the season before to be one of the best teams in the world, rather than experience being the determining factor. However, here we are. Obviously I wouldnt expect to win CL, basically no team should, but if you told me we were like 6th most likely to win it, I think that could be accurate.",Arsenal,Yes,jampsko,t1_jamgixl
"> the last aubameyang defender

In 2023?! What's there to defend at this point? Man no longer provides any goalscoring threat. Or anything really.",Arsenal,Yes,jan4h06,t1_jamutm9
We should bear in mind what Liverpool did with Coutinho. If a stupidly high offer came in for him and he wanted to go then we should let him and reinvest it.,Arsenal,Yes,jalnr51,t1_jalmpkx
I didn't say we should .....i said I can see him being subject of a big bid,Arsenal,Yes,jalzv3v,t1_jalmpkx
I meant to say ‚Äúin form‚Äù,Arsenal,Yes,jaorlhf,t1_jaorea4
"That's solid, but hasn't Mers already trademarked *What Success?*",Arsenal,Yes,jamkucj,t1_jamkkv8
Ah might throw one on arsenal each way myself,Arsenal,Yes,jalua54,t1_jaltk2d
"Camavinga can defo play that role. He played LB for France, idk what crack Deschamps was smoking but he did exceptionally well there, was our better player on the pitch",Arsenal,Yes,jaomziz,t1_jaoc7ak
"Agreed. 

We need that positive vibes back as I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs being reflected on the pitch. I haven‚Äôt been able to see the game last night, annoyingly, but I could sense it on the chat on here. Jorginho was slagged off after 4 minutes and someone asked for Martinelli to be subbed at 13 minutes. 

Start of the season just felt like party time. If we can get that back it‚Äôll be a fortress again I‚Äôm sure",Arsenal,Yes,jalnjlz,t1_jalncox
"Yeah, well‚Ä¶

Why don't you go eat a Salad Cream sandwich?",Arsenal,Yes,janfrcm,t1_janfi6a
We were toe to toe with them for the most part. Wait for the away fixture.,Arsenal,Yes,jaon5ay,t1_jann1xa
wouldn't them not being able to sign anyone make it more likely for them to not selll anyone?,Arsenal,Yes,janflkv,t1_janbhzc
"I think you're underestimating Martinelli's decision making there.

Martinelli is better at dribbling at speed, is faster, a better one on one finisher and is just as happy playing all across the front three when someone is willing to cover the left wing for him.

He's much more of a poacher and what he doesn't have Jesus does, whereas Trossard is a slightly lesser Jesus with better finishing.",Arsenal,Yes,janjc29,t1_janizo2
"Martinelli is our best finisher. The disrespect from takes like this is hilarious. 

Trossard is a good player, but he‚Äôs not on Martinelli‚Äôs level.",Arsenal,Yes,jania08,t1_jani14q
Nonsense. That is literally nonsense. He‚Äôs marginally better if at all.,Arsenal,Yes,janlv0p,t1_jani14q
That just isn‚Äôt true. Slightly better maybe.,Arsenal,Yes,janjawl,t1_jani14q
"I always try an Arsenal save but I get annoyed with it after we do a transfer window as I either have a player they club sold or they buy in someone who I'd love to use in my team lol.

So I usually find more success in keeping a save going with teams I don't follow and I love the lower league challenge to get to the top league. Loved a Kaiserslautern save as well but no Arsenal connection in that one unfortunately.",Arsenal,Yes,jaml0yr,t1_jamjvao
"Then there would be no need for clubs to target 9s.

Just wide forward bonanzas. ETH finally went the Weghorst route. 

They can drift, but their heat map has to specialise.",Arsenal,Yes,jamk20s,t1_jamfp6y
"But would you say that Trossard was elevating our play in that first half against Everton? Because that's the point I'm trying to make.

He plays different as Nketiah, but the result was basically the same. We created fuck all, until the goal. We needed a moment of class from 2 top players to break through. Trossard only started shining when the game opened up more, and Nketiah would have done so aswell I believe.

Once again I'm not trying to shit on Trossard. I'm a big fan of him and I love what he brings to the team. Imagine if we've lost today, he would have been slated.",Arsenal,Yes,jalq8za,t1_jaloyer
"For example if Nketiah convert shit loads of his xG to goals, who would have criticized him? Noone. If u failed that then u must put something else on the table, which is lacking in comparison with what Trossard / Martinelli demonstrated in these two games.",Arsenal,Yes,jalppsp,t1_jalpkhu
"Well if you look at the comments in here, in previous match threads, post game antics etc, he gets a shit ton of hate, which I never understood.

Never seen a Hale end boy get this much slack. You might not be hating on him, but you can't deny he gets hate from a big part of our fanbase",Arsenal,Yes,jalpuwl,t1_jalpkhu
Our LHS was not particularly good in the first half though. Don‚Äôt know how you can say that‚Äôs wrong. Neither goal came from that side and the 40 minutes before the goal weren‚Äôt exactly brilliant from us.,Arsenal,Yes,jalo0oh,t1_jalnqsp
We didn‚Äôt create a single chance blud. literally 0 shots lmao. Everton completely nullified us because we couldn‚Äôt sustain pressure without Partey,Arsenal,Yes,jaloqfc,t1_jalnqsp
"To be fair Everton were also really good in the first 40 minutes at what they were looking to do, which is fair enough.

But Ode - Saka is just magic, and from there it was all over for them.",Arsenal,Yes,jalnuh0,t1_jalnqkh
"I mean that's how a season goes. Nobody is saying ""City are only in the title race still because VAR fucked Arsenal and they played Arsenal away when Arsenal were in bad form"".",Arsenal,Yes,jam1k11,t1_jam050j
lol.  People who simp the players like OP are fucking weird mate.  You know the players would read that and side eye....,Arsenal,Yes,jan38jq,t1_jan2ifw
I bet gary glitter said he was kids uncles a lot too....,Arsenal,Yes,janbqgz,t1_janbkw7
Well their title strip might mean United will get some of those EPL‚Äôs,Arsenal,Yes,jap7o7j,t1_jap5kul
"It was never a penalty and it wasn‚Äôt a free kick in the first half. Also Adebayors shirts were almost pulled off late on before they equalized. Clearest penalty all season not given.
Mike Deans role in that collapse is not forgotten",Arsenal,Yes,jao9jha,t1_jao41pe
"Most of last night had Trossard out on the left and Gabi through the middle. 

Maybe the solution is just....

Gabi through the middle = Gabi scores more goals. 

Not shitting on Trossard, he's been class, brings a level of flexibility to our game. But this idea that idea thar Eddie refuses to pass to Marti I think misses out that he's just fundamentally a different type of player.",Arsenal,Yes,janppxt,t1_janowe6
Eddie was on the pitch for two of those four goals mate. And Trossard only assisted him for one. Trossard has been great but to attribute Martinelli‚Äôs goalscoring form to him is a massive oversimplification.,Arsenal,Yes,janpzur,t1_janowe6
"Some Arsenal fans are so weird, just looking for excuses to shit on Nketiah for some reason",Arsenal,Yes,janyvm9,t1_jans0r8
It has nothing to do with Eddie's linkup play which is very good.,Arsenal,Yes,janysbq,t1_janrlub
which isn't link up play,Arsenal,Yes,janyz37,t1_janwv8t
"Current odds go Haaland, then ode, rashford then saka",Arsenal,Yes,jalv6ef,t1_jalur7p
So like I said hopefully we get Camavinga,Arsenal,Yes,jao1zwu,t1_jao1ve0
I trust in teta but I can't imagine a midfield of partey and jorg without changing our system up completely.,Arsenal,Yes,jaot55u,t1_jao94j7
"Greenwood was good, he just ended up being a shit human",Arsenal,Yes,jaq3oej,t1_jaq0v8x
"Zinny is ahead of the pecking order for a reason. Do u agree? 

So let's dig out what Zinny can do and KT fails to do, and u will get it.",Arsenal,Yes,jalqd4j,t1_jalpfko
"This. I'd rather play Partey in the PL games and Jorginho in the Europa, for instance.",Arsenal,Yes,jam9lxf,t1_jam2x5r
"He would, and he'd improve us-- but the point about wages and limitations stands.

There are a lot of midfielders who would improve us there.",Arsenal,Yes,jan4g45,t1_jan2w0r
Someone like Toney.,Arsenal,Yes,jaltkp8,t1_jaltctc
I mean they all hold French citizenships so that technically makes them French people,Arsenal,Yes,janhr9o,t1_janhnad
"Mbappe is half Cameroonian, half Algerian

I'm talking about descent",Arsenal,Yes,janj5xh,t1_janj2wp
"why wouldn't it be the reason why?  Why would you question a 2nd, 3rd, or later generation's frenchness..... well unless you're a racist lol.",Arsenal,Yes,jane8cc,t1_jancweh
"There are people saying he was questioned though.

Obvioulsy racism is stupid as fuck anyway and isn't really at home to logic but FIFA rules that you can play for a country with one grandparent, gaining citizenship or just having spent the majority of your education there so using eligibility for your national team as 'proof' of some sort of pure bloodline is just stupid to begin with.",Arsenal,Yes,janohgc,t1_jannfg8
"Still always thought he was French.

I mean there's very few people who are 'English' and don't have at least one non english grandparent if not more and we're on an island so the second largest country on the continent is going to have a lot more people with mixed heritages.",Arsenal,Yes,jann44p,t1_janmqey
Yes and hes hilarious (to laugh at),Arsenal,Yes,jamygtk,t1_jamycz0
It's easy but but not impossible to not have a positive atmosphere,Arsenal,Yes,jap66jy,t1_jaotwmr
Went in one once and never again! I had to like check my eyes to see if I was watching the same game as everyone else in the thread lmao,Arsenal,Yes,jaoy0sp,t1_jaotwmr
Yesterday was the first time nelli played well with eddie,Arsenal,Yes,jalshsg,t1_jalq3by
when the team is 3-0 up with 10 minutes left and the rest of the team is on fire it's easier to get a goal rather than at 0-0 or 1-0,Arsenal,Yes,jalslig,t1_jalq3by
grasping at straws,Arsenal,Yes,jalqpuw,t1_jalq3by
"Well, last two game has just demonstrated that. Nketiah has to fight for his place, intense competition since ESR is back, and Jesus will be back very soon. Arteta is spoilt for choice at the front, so let's hope Nketiah add something to his game ASAP,  begging for tolerance won't help his chance I'm afraid.",Arsenal,Yes,jalqsuq,t1_jalq3by
Fair! It would have been a fun final if we did end up playing them there. Would have liked the revenge!,Arsenal,Yes,jaonery,t1_jaojzeo
"Woah calm down there just having a friendly discussion. Don‚Äôt need to take everything so personally.

What exactly feels ‚Äúoff‚Äù about him? How was his performance off?",Arsenal,Yes,jan7ebo,t1_jan71jm
"He's in the category of lukewarm talent that accepts the part. Like Elneny, Nelson.",Arsenal,Yes,japoc70,t1_japnmne
"> left side White

Tomi.  

I like the idea of developing our own version of Zinchenko though.  While his skillset is unique, I don't necessarily think its rare.",Arsenal,Yes,janvm45,t1_janudla
What can he improve then? His off the ball movement is excellent in the first half he was surrounded by 3 players all the time. Teams know his final ball is butter. If you watch the first goal again and look at Ode hes in perfect position to make the the CB off balance thats why Saka was so free to take that shot. Sometimes not having the ball is not being anonymous.,Arsenal,Yes,jalokob,t1_jalnq69
It‚Äôs really close in my opinion. Take any of those three out and their respective teams are 10-15 points lower.,Arsenal,Yes,jam4zho,t1_jam4py8
Agreed. Good on you.,Arsenal,Yes,janajha,t1_jan9nrm
"Okay, I now understand what you mean.

I also don't like it that it's this way but am not gonna consider it a black mark, the players have worked too hard for this so am not gonna let anything affect my enjoyment of the success we may or may not have",Arsenal,Yes,jane5oz,t1_jan9nrm
"nah too soon

there are other bench players who need minutes ahead of him right now

he'll get involved in the European games",Arsenal,Yes,jamaehm,t1_jam9q9k
"Form is definitely part of it, but I think the locker room doesn't respect potter at this point. The toxic Chelsea culture of win or get the sack is really hurting them currently and I don't think it will change unless they sack him and get a new manager bounce. 

This is nothing against Potter btw, I think he's a decent manager, just the wrong club for him.",Arsenal,Yes,jaoffka,t1_jaoek9r
"> Easy games 

No such thing",Arsenal,Yes,jamhytu,t1_jamhh1k

"Well he still does occasionally, he was whipping in some great crosses against Everton. But it‚Äôs not necessary. We are creating and scoring enough atm.",Arsenal,Yes,jalr9iq,t1_jalqkfs
"They have the toughest schedule based on gambling odds, average position in the table and home vs away opponents.",Arsenal,Yes,jap7vm6,t1_jap31qq

It's factually true they're cheap as a Red Sox fan they let a top 3 player in the game get traded because they didn't want to pay him same with our best SS,Arsenal,Yes,janxpvv,t1_janx2jv
Why though.  Whats the branding on his boots matter as long as they don't provide him with lead clogs?,Arsenal,Yes,jan3cgs,t1_jan28ih
Honestly think you might be on your own on this one mate,Arsenal,Yes,jan6ett,t1_jan28ih
"I saw a team park the bus for 40 minutes and us undo them.

People park the bus all the time, it's when they can do it succesfully that you can start worrying and winning 4-0 means they didn't park the bus succesfully.",Arsenal,Yes,jang4vp,t1_janfe4j
"And yet.... would still have had 50 more mins to work it out..... but we did it without needing all those minutes... didn't we....

nugget.",Arsenal,Yes,jana5zr,t1_jan9r3l
"Yh it‚Äôs a good strategy but can be beaten like all systems can be. The way our players change position so fluidly and move the ball into the right spaces is the only way to beat those systems. I think Trossard now coming in along with Jesus hopefully coming back, will allow us to break those teams down. Newcastle played it well but we also could‚Äôve taken advantage a bit better in certain moments. Very rare that 2 games of football are ever the same. I trust Mikel to make the right adjustments to deal with those sort of setups (we did last night tbf) when we face them.",Arsenal,Yes,janecfd,t1_jand25k
"Well I disagree. That win over Everton was one of our most comfortable all season. And with Trossard filling in the Jesus role, we can start playing like we did pre-world cup. 

No need to worry about a problem until there is a problem.",Arsenal,Yes,jan8wuu,t1_jan88us
Omari Hutchinson made such a stupid decision going there... Like why on earth would he think Chelsea is a better enviornement for him to break into the first team than ours?,Arsenal,Yes,jalz1dw,t1_jalnp50
"Oh, i want that club to become irrelevant like Spurs, let Todd the clueless punk keep making bad decisions.",Arsenal,Yes,jalnwhr,t1_jalnp50
">However, this is a club that just seems to sign players for the sake of it

Sadly this is how they actually think too. All over Reddit chelshit fans were chuffed they beat us to Mudryk's signature. Most literally couldn't tell you anything about him or how he'd improve their squad but they didn't care, preventing us from signing him and forcing us onto a plan B (in Trossard) was enough for them. 

I wonder how many of them still have the same opinion now.",Arsenal,Yes,jaoqeno,t1_jalnp50
"Point taken.

And he is an absolute cunt of a United fan. He was calling Saka the ‚Äúblack James Milner‚Äù the other day while labouring the same point. He‚Äôs a prick.",Arsenal,Yes,janpn7r,t1_janp4kl
"They have no fire power. Best option they have is what they‚Äôre doing now which is sitting deep and hoping to scrape 1-0 wins


Going all out for a win against city would be suicide",Arsenal,Yes,jan29m6,t1_jan1dvd
"I agree we're in a great place, but so were Topspur under Poche and it fizzled out. It also feels like it's a different landscape in the Prem from when Wenger racked up titles. We've gone from talking of ""Top 2"" to ""Top 6"" in 20 years.

I'm optimistic‚Äîthis year is competitive (unlike 15/16) and we're deservedly on top‚Äîbut remember Klopp's team were possibly one season cancellation from not winning the league.

And if we dream of that CL trophy with this squad, besting City now is such a huge confidence swing over having to recharge next year.",Arsenal,Yes,jannc1l,t1_janje73
Which is not a reason to hate on Martinelli,Arsenal,Yes,jamcj5l,t1_jambwz4
"Liverpool sold Coutinho to fund their rebuild. 

Our rebuild is nearing completion.",Arsenal,Yes,jalvr7s,t1_jalnr51
"Tbh I dont see the futures as great value.

You'd be better off just betting arsenal to advance v Sporting and rolling it over, or the individual games and doing the same.",Arsenal,Yes,jaludm7,t1_jalua54
"Match thread was unbearable.... these idiots expect a goal every 5 minutes, every dispossession is the end of the world.",Arsenal,Yes,jalo6b5,t1_jalnjlz
"Because I have pride.

And taste buds",Arsenal,Yes,jang74g,t1_janfrcm
"Mate if anything, Martinelli‚Äôs decision making is his weakest/poorest attribute. He frequently shoots when should pass and vice versa. Trossard is more balanced.",Arsenal,Yes,janjz8v,t1_janjc29
"Well you just repeated everything I said about nelli, not sure why.
I didn't say he has bad decision making, but he often gets past his man, opening up for a cross and just hesitates, cuts back or runs too long with the ball. Trossard is clear on that aspect.",Arsenal,Yes,janjxv5,t1_janjc29
"Maye, have you seen some of the bangers trossard scored this season for Brighton? His finishing is class",Arsenal,Yes,janjgj5,t1_jania08
"No right now Trossard is the better finisher, he's scored some mad ones this season.",Arsenal,Yes,janl885,t1_jania08
"I didn‚Äôt dispute his finishing. I only mentioned his technical ability which includes things like dribbling, passing etc which trossard is way better at",Arsenal,Yes,janiqc6,t1_jania08
"Target 9s in what context?

It's easier to have a 9 focal point but it also makes it easier for defences to mark and develop a plan to limit the effect of that focal point. You see games every week where a focal point striker is starved and largely ineffective.

I don't agree with that last point as said in my previous comment.",Arsenal,Yes,jamky9h,t1_jamk20s
"The first goal was a concerted TEAM GOAL, for God sake pls go and watch again. Look where Trossard was, how Ode delay his passing to induce pressing, and Zinny cutting into the right to create overload, and Saka just step into the tiny gap just 1 m away from Tarkowski, and Zinny releas the ball....",Arsenal,Yes,jalr8xj,t1_jalq8za
Yeah i can agree with that sentiment. Everyone was playing top football after the game opened up.,Arsenal,Yes,jalqivh,t1_jalq8za
"Which player didn't have a shit tonnes of hatred with the exception of our darling starboy Saka? 

Read thru the match thread u understand what I said. These kids just forget what they said as soon as the next goal.

So best solution is to shut up their mouth with end products.",Arsenal,Yes,jalqj15,t1_jalpuwl
"The goals didn't come from the sleft side BUT it came from our continuous probing thru ball. We had at least 8~9 attempts I lost count , we succeed in the 40th. That's how u breakdown a low block by constantly moving around, making defenders lost track - hence the first goal.",Arsenal,Yes,jalp5np,t1_jalo0oh
"Yes it's true not a shot initially, but did u count the final balls we tried? How do breakdown walls in order to shoot, the walls are compact and physical! U try thru ball into the tiny gaps, 1/10 success rate is a VERY GOOD RETURN. I'll take that any time.",Arsenal,Yes,jalq5q6,t1_jaloqfc
"lmao aww, is someone having a bad day? üò¢",Arsenal,Yes,janf0w3,t1_janbqgz
Isn't that a fair decision?,Arsenal,Yes,japdban,t1_jap7o7j
"nevertheless, gabi in the middle = gabi goals does indicate it would be ideal if eddie got better and more comfortable playing as wide drifter, basically as a winger, to optimally contribute to our system. 

in fairness, his performance was encouraging. he's progressed a lot, always adding new things and pushing his limits. his mentality is solid, i think he'll grow his playing chemistry with martinelli soon",Arsenal,Yes,jansfb1,t1_janppxt
Having Trossard start it allows him to interchange from the wings to centrally.,Arsenal,Yes,janq1rv,t1_janppxt
"I'm with you, I think the injury that Eddie was carrying + the amount of game load he has had are bigger factors. It's great to be able to move to Trossard as cover and he offers something a bit different to keep us more varied and unpredictable.",Arsenal,Yes,janqy9m,t1_janpzur
He makes it easier on Martinelli same way Jesus did. Eddie is a poacher his link up play doesn't fit Martinelli,Arsenal,Yes,janqaxp,t1_janpzur
It doesn't matter Gabi plays better with trossard that's obvious,Arsenal,Yes,jao073f,t1_janyz37
Rashford's been amazing but if we're talking strictly league performances I'm not sure I put him above Saka. But that might just be my bias speaking,Arsenal,Yes,jalvx4x,t1_jalv6ef
Lmfaooo,Arsenal,Yes,jao4su2,t1_jao1zwu
Learn to take a joke you melt,Arsenal,Yes,jao26f6,t1_jao1zwu
He wasn‚Äôt nearly as good as people act,Arsenal,Yes,jaq4euy,t1_jaq3oej
"there's nothing to 'get', i understand perfectly well why zinchenko plays. the conversation is about tierney crossing, not why zinchenko is a better player for us",Arsenal,Yes,jalqnbw,t1_jalqd4j
"Don't you see how well the team plays without a static CF?

This team needs a player with elite movement that can swap to the wings, not a target man.",Arsenal,Yes,jalu113,t1_jaltkp8
"You don't even need that to represent france, just a french grandparent.

If someone wants to play for france, is eligible for france and is willing to put up with watching Griezmann practice his stupid celebrations all day then there really shouldn't be any question of their commitment to france.",Arsenal,Yes,jani6li,t1_janhr9o
Ohh gotcha. Descent doesn‚Äôt mean much in these cases. 1/3 the US team national team is from overseas also so it‚Äôs just the nature of national teams.,Arsenal,Yes,janm1qv,t1_janj5xh
I'm not. But if he weren't White I know some that would...,Arsenal,Yes,janfnrg,t1_jane8cc
"yeah started following him recently on twitter, has been great. there was some compilation of all his tiktoks this year that was soooooo good lol",Arsenal,Yes,jamynfd,t1_jamygtk
They‚Äôre cesspits of misery *unless* we‚Äôre destroying the opposition. When we were up 4-0 yesterday it was like a party,Arsenal,Yes,jaoyx42,t1_jaoy0sp
"So what changed yesterday, and is it replicable going forward?",Arsenal,Yes,jalstso,t1_jalshsg
Sure. That doesn‚Äôt mean what I said isn‚Äôt also true though.,Arsenal,Yes,jalsp2p,t1_jalslig
Hardly. I‚Äôm just trying to understand what actually happened in the game rather than going along with the prevailing narrative.,Arsenal,Yes,jalqwr8,t1_jalqpuw
To be fair you started off with ‚ÄòGet a grip.‚Äô That‚Äôs going to annoy anyone from the get go.,Arsenal,Yes,jan897m,t1_jan7ebo
"Didn't feel particularly friendly. His feet have looked heavier than usual, obviously don't expect him to dribble beyond too many guys, maybe it's just a minutes thing and he's tired. What worries me is his defensive presence nearer our box. He's still winning the ball back on attack, but his positioning when defending our half hasn't been great. Again, he looks to be actively avoiding fouling in a dangerous position...which we've been awful at, so Maybe that's an Arteta directive",Arsenal,Yes,jan8t7d,t1_jan7ebo
My wild prediction is that Patino becomes an inverted LB,Arsenal,Yes,janwxpv,t1_janvm45
"I can see why left side Tomi could be great as well but what's particular reason you'd prefer that? Defensive solidity? 

I like the idea of developing a right side Zinchenko too, perhaps we can bring in a youngster. The player just needs to be really technically able.",Arsenal,Yes,janwvh0,t1_janvm45
That's certainly true.,Arsenal,Yes,jam5nu8,t1_jam4zho
Probably comes down to whoever wins the league then. Feel like Casemiro is a lock because Utd media bias,Arsenal,Yes,jam6y6o,t1_jam4zho
That's totally fair and prob the best way to look at the whole thing,Arsenal,Yes,jangbwl,t1_jane5oz
"Usually yes

But this Bournemouth team looks absolutely awful.",Arsenal,Yes,jammmnf,t1_jamhytu
get ‚Äòem aofrantic,Arsenal,Yes,japflch,t1_jap7vm6
Look at all the championships they have won. They have a method that they trust and it produces results.,Arsenal,Yes,janyyij,t1_janxpvv
"Critical thought isn't your strongest asset, is it.",Arsenal,Yes,janaoaz,t1_jana5zr
"Comfortable after we broke the deadlock, yes. That's what happens when a team whose plan is solely based around mitigating the opponent suddenly needs to chase.",Arsenal,Yes,jan9mww,t1_jan8wuu
"The only defence I can give him is that Saka is an icon and generational talent from the academy playing in the same position. So unlikely to be starting whereas Chelsea don‚Äôt have that.

However, that‚Äôs me clutching at straws as he could be playing in cup competitions here and getting minutes that way which he isn‚Äôt there at all. They tried to send him to WBA and that failed. 

He is the sort of player I can see doing well for Reading or QPR in a few years time.",Arsenal,Yes,jalz7zp,t1_jalz1dw
"Yep. Finish in the bottom waste even more cash and split it over 5-8 years and screw over tomorrows windows too! 

That guy is a fool.",Arsenal,Yes,jalodtk,t1_jalnwhr
How the hell is conte up for manager of the month btw! I‚Äôm fairly sure the only game he was on the touchline for was Leicester and they got smashed haha üòÇ,Arsenal,Yes,jalof89,t1_jalnwhr
"I remember that and it just showed an embarrassment to football for me. We even had them come on to this fan page to insult us.

However, I would say I liked Rory on YouTube speaking about it. He called it out and said it was pathetic (not mudryk himself but the situation) and he lost connection with his club over the dirty cash business.",Arsenal,Yes,jaorm2d,t1_jaoqeno
"Rantsandbants is a fucking knob lmao. He does that podcast with expressions (I actually rate ex very highly, he‚Äôs hilarious and such a likeable guy) and his agenda towards Arsenal is on another level. Like way more than United fans i know. The guy is literally another cunt of a Londoner supporting the shitedevils up north. Biggest arsenal shittaker on the internet. Will hit like crack seeing him cry when we win those major trophies and his shitty SAF, bald fraud club rots to the ground again.",Arsenal,Yes,janzc06,t1_janpn7r
well that‚Äôs certainly a take,Arsenal,Yes,janqekd,t1_janpn7r
If they need the points they need the points...... a draw is worthless if it still means you get relegated.,Arsenal,Yes,jan3ggk,t1_jan29m6
">I agree we're in a great place, but so were Topspur under Poche and it fizzled out

Firstly - they were never anywhere near our current points per game pace. Even if there is a drop off, this Arteta still to be completed team would still be better.

Secondly, Topspur didn't fizzle out, they had a good run of 5 years or so, played a CL final, etc. Given our current squad is better than that Spurs squad, who knows what is possible for us in the next 5 years. Claiming that we will be relegated to 4th behind City, United and Liverpool is wrong.",Arsenal,Yes,janoclj,t1_jannc1l
"Don't see how you can compare us to that topspur period.

The level of investment and more importantly the quality of how we've invested it are levels on that team.

Then Liverpool..... again the level of squad management is what cost them plus some bad luck with injuries.  Look at what we have now, we're already better prepared for injuries than they ever were.",Arsenal,Yes,janpl1b,t1_jannc1l
"Not excusing hate but honestly I haven't seen much that I would call ""hate"". I think that some criticism of his late-January and February performances is fair. He wasn't performing nearly as well as he had been pre-world cup and people acknowledging that and suggesting Trossard come in for a while for Martinelli to have a bit of a rest is fair enough.

If there was more than that then I'd agree on it but I just haven't seen much of it.",Arsenal,Yes,jamdh2z,t1_jamcj5l
"Is your proposal that we turn down things like record sales fees and force players who wanted out to stay? That's the sort of final action that makes you say, ""rebuild complete""? 

If someone wants to leave and we're staring at the right offer for it too we shouldn't underestimate what forcing them to stay could do to the team chemistry and state of our rebuild.",Arsenal,Yes,jampfcu,t1_jalvr7s
"Good idea actually, wasn‚Äôt even thinking that",Arsenal,Yes,jalumpc,t1_jaludm7
"Think there's some receny bias here with Trossard, just this last game you've had a goal where he's read what both Saka and Eddie were going to do perfectly and he was integral to the opener by being on the right wing (with our left back) causing the overload that allows saka to get free and score.",Arsenal,Yes,jankn17,t1_janjz8v
"I didn't, reread what I said!",Arsenal,Yes,jankdxn,t1_janjxv5
"Yes, he‚Äôs a great technical player. So is martinelli. Saying he‚Äôs 100x more technical player than Gabi is a ridiculous disrespectful take. 

Fans have a nasty habit of trying to tear down others while lifting up others. Martinelli is a spectacular technical player in different ways. Excellent first touch, great dribbler, great finisher.",Arsenal,Yes,jao33z1,t1_janjgj5
"Huh? Martinelli is 4th in the league in successful dribbles. He‚Äôs one of the best in the league at it. 

Trossard is a tidy player, but this comment from you is perplexing.",Arsenal,Yes,janjnx6,t1_janiqc6
"And that's one moment in the whole of the first half. Would you argue that Nketiah would not create one moment for others?

You are so high on your ""Trossard is so much better than Nketiah"" horse that you fail to see my reasoning. 

You are acting like Trossard personally decimated that Everton low block yesterday, when the reality is that we didn't create a single opportunity until the 35th minute. That's very similar to what happened with Nketiah or worse.

I love Trossard and he deserves all the plaudits, but I don't understand how people can say he is so much better than Nketiah after this game",Arsenal,Yes,jalsaqa,t1_jalr8xj
"Ppl don't realise the assist came from Zinny , and Trossard was on the far left taking away a defender with him. Without the fluidity we will have big trouble breaking down the walls. Everton has done a good job for 40 minutes, credit where credit due.",Arsenal,Yes,jalpcyj,t1_jalp5np
Our ‚Äúprobing‚Äù was largely ineffective in the first 40 minutes though. I‚Äôm not sure we even had a shot. We created next to nothing until the goal. And it wasn‚Äôt the LHS that opened up their defence.,Arsenal,Yes,jalp9tg,t1_jalp5np
I'd love to know how old you are to see where on the stupid to creepy scale your original comment lies.,Arsenal,Yes,janfnm6,t1_janf0w3
No,Arsenal,Yes,japtxnl,t1_japdban
"Eddie‚Äôs link up with Martinelli hasn‚Äôt been great until last night - he did literally assist Martinelli, remember - but it‚Äôs still an oversimplification to attribute Martinelli‚Äôs goalscoring to Trossard. Two things to consider - Martinelli was dropped for Trossard vs. Villa, giving him a much needed rest. Second, Martinelli has scored after drifting centrally, both with and without Trossard involved in the buildup, and Eddie literally facilitated that exact thing last night. The main thing that has changed is the fact that Martinelli is now in fact rotating into CF, when he wasn‚Äôt before. That is as much a tactical shift as it is a shift resulting from changing personnel.",Arsenal,Yes,janrmy1,t1_janqaxp
Im not denying that Im just calling this guy out for needlessly shitting on Nketiah,Arsenal,Yes,jao0azp,t1_jao073f
"Saka has better GA, plays for the top side and influences matches way more even when not contributing. It isn't bias...",Arsenal,Yes,jam02zl,t1_jalvx4x
"You get forgot the Man U bias that will inevitably be shown. I think if they get CL and FA + Carabao, which is very doable, he 100% wins it just based on pure circlejerk. Haaland or Saka deserve based on who wins the league IMO.",Arsenal,Yes,jam177q,t1_jalvx4x
I think he's joking back ....,Arsenal,Yes,jaob9o4,t1_jao26f6
Ruined it with this didn‚Äôt you,Arsenal,Yes,jaodfzg,t1_jao26f6
"Nah he was a top player, 2 footed too.",Arsenal,Yes,jaq6huf,t1_jaq4euy
Sometimes you can just see quality and greenwood definitely showed it.,Arsenal,Yes,jaqceds,t1_jaq4euy
He was good. Same level with Martinelli at some point.,Arsenal,Yes,jaqdc1y,t1_jaq4euy
"We have seen many many times last season when we played the U shaped passing , until KT crossed. Do u remember?

It was not working and the coaches don't think it works, hence we stop putting in cross upon cross. U remember Trossard assist Ode? He had a glance before he send in a low cut back to Ode, that's what we expect from the wing.... We were never the taller team, and we are not now.q",Arsenal,Yes,jalrlh3,t1_jalqnbw
"Toney, for example, is more than a target man. I don't care who we get, I'd like someone who can get 30 goals a season.",Arsenal,Yes,jalu4ty,t1_jalu113
"He's not White, he's Griezmann.

White plays for us mate.",Arsenal,Yes,janggty,t1_janfnrg
"I love the ones where people take his rages and then put it over a headline that says ""ruse of Muslims in Ireland"" making him look hella bad",Arsenal,Yes,jamz34q,t1_jamynfd
"I was at work while everyone else partied :( 

Oh well we will just have to repeat the performance this weekend üòé",Arsenal,Yes,japm5hz,t1_jaoyx42
"I was at the game so I'm telling you firsthand what I witnessed. Eddie ironically got his assist because he did something he rarely ever does... come out wide and square it across the box.

Trossard unlocked martinelli once more, he plays like a mini Jesus in that false 9 role. Gabi got a dangerous dribble in so many times because the Everton defence was utterly confused whether to go after him or trossard. They kept interchanging the ball and interchanging positions and it confused the hell out of them.

Nketiah stays mostly down the middle to do one purpose: score. But lately his finishing hasn't been great, and that was personified when he missed an absolute sitter from partey's wonderful over the top ball.",Arsenal,Yes,jalsixj,t1_jalqwr8
Hard to convey tone over typed comments but I didn‚Äôt mean anything by it. Calling me a cunt seems like an overreaction.,Arsenal,Yes,jan8kj5,t1_jan897m
He looked more comfortable when Partey came on imo so maybe it‚Äôs a question of how mobile our holding midfielder is which lets Xhaka have less defensive responsibility.,Arsenal,Yes,jan9l9h,t1_jan8t7d
It's something I could see happening too.  That one still has some time on the vine.,Arsenal,Yes,janyjnt,t1_janwxpv
Tomi played on the left side against Liverpool.  I think he's a really excellent inverted FB and covers space well.  His quality is ultimately dwarfed by what Zinchenko does.,Arsenal,Yes,janydaw,t1_janwvh0
"We drew Southampton and lost to Everton.

No easy games. Period.",Arsenal,Yes,jamohg4,t1_jammmnf
Yeah they have a method got rid of the players who helped win them world series.,Arsenal,Yes,janz2rw,t1_janyyij

"Right, what‚Äôs the problem? We scored with most of the game remaining. That‚Äôs a job well done, no panic stations necessary.",Arsenal,Yes,janai3l,t1_jan9mww
"True but at Arsenal there's room for him to be in that winger discussion and come in and out...

At Chelsea there's like 10 players ahead of him so it's a bizarre call.

Feels like it was a wage thing",Arsenal,Yes,jalzvy3,t1_jalz7zp
"Well, they can't nominate Stellini can they? If any ounce of the manager of the month curse still exist, i want him to win it and exert further misery on Chicken and Ball fc",Arsenal,Yes,jaltzcr,t1_jalof89
"Yeah sad how few and far between those levelheaded takes were. So many of them were literally like moustache twirling cartoon villains and revelling in it too. 

I'm just happy it's working out for them about as well as things normally work out for cartoon villains.",Arsenal,Yes,jaowdbj,t1_jaorm2d
Agreed on everything. Rants is a twat. Expressions is a comedic genius. I‚Äôm surprised they get on tbh,Arsenal,Yes,jao83nx,t1_janzc06
"They need the points now yet still went for a draw against us and only managed to nick a goal on a corner.

Good run and zero titles. That was my whole point.",Arsenal,Yes,janp0nq,t1_janoclj
"You may not spend as much time on here as me ;)

Your money is also not locked up for months doing it that way.,Arsenal,Yes,jaluoi7,t1_jalumpc
"Not really, I‚Äôve watched him with Brighton enough times and I find he‚Äôs quicker in his decision-making, probably stems from more experience.",Arsenal,Yes,jannpkb,t1_jankn17
"I did, still is basically the same, unless you want to get pedantic. Look, we don't have to agree on this, it's fine. For now they play well together and that's all that matters.",Arsenal,Yes,janlsor,t1_jankdxn
"In a 1v1 scenario on the left hand side touchline I‚Äôd much prefer trossard. A chance in the box, id prefer Martinelli",Arsenal,Yes,jankg4r,t1_janjnx6
"Tell me when did I said "" Trossard is so much better than Nketiah""!!! Are u forcing it down onto me?

I have been trying to tell everybody the ENTIRE team tried several attempts in THRU BALL , no less than 8~9 times if recall correctly, until 40 minutes we had one success, then the entire game opens up.

That's what I said. U try to advocate Nketiah, fine.Just pls dun down play other players efforts for your Nketiah bias, let him earn his place in the team.",Arsenal,Yes,jalx2ze,t1_jalsaqa
[Positions of our players before the Saka goal.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FqLDCY_WcAEf5Rw?format=jpg&name=large) LHS players rotating was crucial to the goal.,Arsenal,Yes,jalpz5v,t1_jalp9tg

Lmao smell ya later dingus",Arsenal,Yes,jano8ez,t1_janfnm6
Why not?,Arsenal,Yes,japwt7d,t1_japtxnl

"how does that make tierneys crossing a bad thing lmao? 'we struggled to break teams down until tierney tried to force something therefore tierney is bad at crossing' magnificent that

"I agree. I am very much clutching at straws.

He was badly advised and in reality that guy they signed from PSV(?) will mean his future is over before it started. He never got any minutes anyway and they were playing Ziyech ahead of him, a player they deemed not good enough and wanted rid of. 

Definitely an agent move. It‚Äôs why I liked that youngster of ours recently that signed a new contract. Sees ESR, Eddie and Saka as icons. I want that mentality coming through. Not if I can‚Äôt play now I‚Äôm out. 

As Eddie said to Sambi - why you feeling sad for yourself, we are all in it, work hard‚Ä¶ or whatever. It‚Äôs a great mentality to have",Arsenal,Yes,jam060v,t1_jalzvy3

"You've got 17 upvotes and this place is full of weirdos like you.  I'm sure most people look at that statement and think ""what a sad cunt"".  Pretty sure Saka would look at that comment and side eye rams dale with a smirk.... you know, because they're normal people.",Arsenal,Yes,janp27z,t1_jano8ez

"Firstly, Eddie was rested because he has played 90 minutes of every single game since the World Cup, and had reportedly had an ankle knock. Second, clearly Trossard has a lot to offer. I‚Äôm so glad he‚Äôs fit into this team like a glove and helped us get through the rough patch we were in. But rotations between the front three are not simply attributed to players‚Äô natural tendencies. Trossard didn‚Äôt invent rotations, and he isn‚Äôt the only option we can play at 9 who can do them. This is coached - it is a tactical decision to put Martinelli into dangerous positions in the centre of the pitch and overload the RHS.",Arsenal,Yes,jansunx,t1_jans2n4

"We had a lengthy discussion I said Nketiah needs to learn that. He has to involve his teammates more, rather than just sit in the box awaiting service. I'm not blaming him, he is a Poacher by nature, changing his preference takes time.",Arsenal,Yes,jalznn4,t1_jalszt2

"But Man United at home happened, and Spurs away happened and Brighton away happened. There is no pattern, you are just cherry picking random games to support your conclusion.

Even Saka gets hate on those..",Arsenal,Yes,jamgsbc,t1_jamgc05
"I'd disagree there.

If you got Napoli a month ago when they were 14/1, that was tremendous value.

They were good favorites in the r16 tie (I bet huge on them to win in Germany), but their odds will be heavily draw dependent.

They could draw Dortmund, Spurs, Milan etc and be down to 4/1 and you can hedge for profit.

Or they could draw City and be back to 12/1 or worse (even though I like them in this matchup)",Arsenal,Yes,jaluwsy,t1_jaluq5b
"Nothing really to agree or disagree here. Imo and I‚Äôve seen other fans say it as well, for all of Martinelli‚Äôs positive traits, his decision-making is the poorest. Hopefully it becomes better with experience.",Arsenal,Yes,janoiad,t1_jano3rr

"So you're just asking for a player to average 30 in all comps when Henry, the best ever and our best player, also didn't manage to do so?

He did average 32 if you take out 06/07, but ""hey, just be as good as prime Thierry henry"" is a hilarious bar to set.

And that is in all competitions.",Arsenal,Yes,jalukyh,t1_jaludp5
"That is literally the whole point, lol. It's about the application of the process Newcastle offered teams. Everton's application wasn't as good as it was in the reverse fixture, but if teams can match it we are going to struggle. 

We didn't create any chances before we broke the deadlock, jfc. 

It's not hard. Think.",Arsenal,Yes,jancmnl,t1_janbzrx
"Lol?

The pattern is teams adopting a low block 451, doubling up on our wingers and having a strong foundation 3-man midfield to mitigate the space our 2-3-5 offers. None of those teams in the games you mentioned used this against us but multiple teams have since we drew to Newcastle. 

That's the pattern lol, it's okay if you can't see it.

And who said I was worried? I said it's something to work on because we aren't perfect, that doesn't mean I'm worried dumpy.",Arsenal,Yes,janc93z,t1_janbqyb

At any time I'll take that 4:0 result. Every single fucking time! Got it?,Arsenal,Yes,jalxr5u,t1_jalxnvm
"Is Eddie incapable of swapping with Martinelli? And if so, how did he get an assist doing exactly that?",Arsenal,Yes,jals95q,t1_jalrdgt
"That is good to hear, show me the cut back u mentioned. I watched every Arsenal game, and I love to have Tierney on my side, my only reservation is he has to improve his decision making, not bombing down the flank every time, there are options u see.

Ofc Zinny is in front of the pecking order, noone should question that.",Arsenal,Yes,jaly9px,t1_jalxokc
"Yeah. Around 30 or so goals a season. Not unreasonable. Plenty of players in the last decade have done so. Messi, Ronaldo, Lewandowski, Salah, Kane, Aguero, Mbappe, Suarez, Haaland etc even guys like Mane, Son, Higuain and Benzema will have had multiple seasons around 30 goals. Probably a fuckton others too. 


We are aiming to be one of the best teams in the world, right? It's not an unreasonable ask to want a forward who can reliably hit around 30 goals a season (I'll accept 25 in a down year).

Maybe Martinelli can become that. Doubt it, but who knows?",Arsenal,Yes,jalv2hc,t1_jalukyh
"Newcastle didn't even set up to do that.  We pushed them back in to their box.

On a side note - what are everyone's thoughts on the long term implications of the way Saka gets kicked about coupled with the sheer number of games he plays? Saw the stat about him appearing in 66 consecutive PL games and whilst that is testament to his durability and consistency I do worry for him. We've seen young players get run into the ground like that before (without being kicked from pillar to post as Saka is).

Is this a serious cause for concern for us going forward or am I reading too much into it?

I always thought that the sensical next step, from a squad building perspective, was trying to identify a younger RB with the potential to invert as well as Zinchenko does on the left. 

That then creates variation in our FBs - with Zinchenko/Tierney as options on the left and White/RBnchenko on the right - to match the variation in our options on the wing (ESR/Martinelli/Trossard on the left have very different profiles and may suit different full back profiles. And on the right, we're rumoured to be targeting a new  RW to back up Saka who, like Trossard, may present a very different profile to the starter ahead of him)

In this squad, Tomiyasu would compete with Ben White for the starting spot while mentoring the understudy, play as a defensive LB/RB against specific opponents, and provide emergency cover at CB

Trossard, ESR and Vieira would thrive centrally in a 3-1 or 4-1 attack, more so than trying to fit them on the wing, up front or in the 8 position. I also think Jesus could be even better in that hole behind the striker, since he plays almost like a hardworking false 9 and has inconsistent finishing.

Lokonga will probably come good in a double pivot. Spent too long on our bench. A full season loan would have done wonders for his pricetag. He doesn't fit our system currently though. Hopefully Palace want to keep him and we can get ¬£30m.",Arsenal,Yes,jaguozs,t1_jagtelb
"We haven‚Äôt done either. 

What are you on about",Arsenal,Yes,jagueqh,t1_jagtelb
"Xhaka does not defend as much as people make out. He can do the double pivot role, but the reason he basically has no cards this season is because he just doesn't tackle as much. He makes less tackles and interceptions than Maddison.

It's more about pressing, positioning and doing the hard work than throwing in tackles etc. Get back into the box to clear the ball out and then run the length of the pitch to get back into the opposition box. Stopping transitions with tackles and interceptions is what Zinchenko and Partey do.

What I'd suggest is, we want a midfielder who will defend from the front and press, and can run all day. Someone who is a hard worker, but also creative and has a few goals. Someone with similar temperament to Odegaard, but can play a little deeper if required. It'd be nice if they were a good ball carrier, we'd probably sacrifice some of √òdegaard's passing for ball carrying for the LCM role as it's nice to have a slightly different profile. Barella would be my choice.",Arsenal,Yes,jagw7sk,t1_jagsyz4
"I think Vieira can do it tbh. Just needs coaching. You don‚Äôt have to be an exceptional defender to defend in the middle bank of a 4-4-2 block. Especially if you‚Äôre next to an adept defensive midfielder like TP. Only way for him to learn is to gain match experience in the role. 

People overestimating the severity of this. Cazorla did it, Ramsey did it, Pep converted B. Silva to play there who was originally a wide creator. You can go on",Arsenal,Yes,jagtx74,t1_jagsyz4
"I would really like to see ESR get a run of games in 8 or 10. I just would like to see him operate in the midfield for my own personal gain. So, possibly not in a title hunt. But ESR banging in an 80th minute thunderbolt from an Ode sub to win the Europa Final would be OK",Arsenal,Yes,jagv0kc,t1_jagsyz4
"As another commenter said, he really doesn‚Äôt do a lot of ‚Äúactual‚Äù defending there. He mostly just stands in the right positions to block out passing lanes but even that part has been lacking a bit lately (watch Villas second goal, Jorginho has to cover two players cause Xhaka is out on the wing for some reason). I‚Äôd trust Vieira and ESR to do that job to a comparable level at least. 

Where those two would struggle to replace him would be in aerial duels, especially when Partey is out cause Jorginho doesn‚Äôt do a lot in the air. ESR is deceptively tall tough, probably about the same size as Xhaka, if he starts to impose himself more in duels he could be almost perfect for the left 8 if he regains his form from early last season.",Arsenal,Yes,jagzzfa,t1_jagsyz4
"We don't do much defending in that block though. Only Vs top teams. 

People talk about Vieira/ESR LCM when we dominate the game and the opponent rarely leaves their low block.",Arsenal,Yes,jaguhov,t1_jagsyz4
"Play tough team - Gundogan/Xhaka.

Play shit team - Silva/Vieira.

Man City have shown the blueprint.",Arsenal,Yes,jagv51r,t1_jagsyz4
I see your argument. However how many times do u expect us to out up a 442 in defense rather than quick counter attack? I think 90% of the time we will be facing the latter.,Arsenal,Yes,jagueyp,t1_jagsyz4
"We generally have the ball somewhere between 60-80% of any given match; we've even dominated City and Newcastle in that respect. For a significant majority of every match, we're on the ball.

Even off the ball, we're only in that 442 block for a fraction of that fraction of the match-- and a fractional fraction that is shrinking. Defining the role by that sub-fraction seems very odd-- especially given what Arteta said to Xhaka in the summer:

> I spoke to him at the end of the season and said, ‚ÄòI need to unlock something in your brain because you‚Äôre so comfortable and confident playing in this area [conventional central midfield] that you have forgot that **actually what is going to win us the game is here [in attack] and the team now demands somebody here**, so unless you unlock that I‚Äôm going to have to do something about it‚Äô.

To put it bluntly, Arteta was telling him we don't win games in that 442 block; we win them in our 235 attacking shape, and that is where he needed to improve to help us-- and did. (For the first 9 matches...)

The final point, to my mind, is even more compelling, and it's one I've made before:

If Arteta could clone √òdegaard, we'd be playing two √òdegaards across the top of our midfield; Xhaka is not benching one of them. If we had that pair of √òdegaards, that 442 block would barely exist off the ball. Whoever inherits that role needs to get close to √òdegaard's standard, not Xhaka's.

Ultimately, the main reason that 442 shape exists is to accommodate Xhaka. He's nowhere near as good at pressing as √òdegaard is, and he's not a good tackler. What he can do is sit back in a space he's told to sit, and be OK-ish in the air. So we give him the smallest possible space to defend, and let him sit there. The passivity of this fractional, momentary role is underscored by just how few defensive actions Xhaka has this season.

Now, as an aside, I agree that this lingering need is part of why Rice is such a good signing-- but that too accentuates the extent to which this is a transitional role. And Rice is a very, very good presser and tackler, so we'll likely see him in a far active role; that  442 block will be even less common with Rice.",Arsenal,Yes,jah91dx,t1_jagsyz4

"United are box office, there was love for Liverpool in the run they just had as an old English power rising again but United have a pull with the English that‚Äôs unmatched, good or bad. The media typically shines a brighter light on them than reality while the public outside of Manchester, watches in hopes they fail. Either way, we‚Äôre all watching and paying attention, that‚Äôs why we have this situation. 

It‚Äôs the same with the England and/or Brazil Football national team, Lakers, Yankees, Cowboys, England and/or New Zealand rugby, Tiger Woods and so on, love or hate them, people will watch.",Arsenal,Yes,jakqd1b,t1_jakmmv5
"I don't disagree that media will hype up all things United but the comparison you've stated is not the entire picture.

First, PL stats may be similar but in all competitions, Saka has 20 GA in 31 while Rashford has 30 GA in 36.

Second, assists may often be more important than assists in actuality but they don't always get the same hype as goals. I personally don't judge players by either but you can't equate them in hype generation. Rashford has 24 goals while Saka has 11.

And third, the most important part of it all is that Saka is remarkably consistent and amazing throughout the year and he has set high standards for himself. While 75+% (haven't checked the actual number) of Rashford's goal contributions have seemingly come after the world cup. It's this incredible hot streak he's on that is generating all the hype.",Arsenal,Yes,jal0r4b,t1_jakmmv5

Even with CL play, we might not be able to keep two very strong players happy at every position. This is exactly why versatility in the squad is so important, and why Tomi would stay even if Tierney asks to leave: he can play either FB position. Same thing on the wing with Trossard, who Arteta has said can play anywhere across the attack, and our prior attacking targets; arguably the same thing with our '8s who can play 6 to some degree' targets, from Locatelli to Tielemans to Rice.

"when KT plays our LB holds the width in the front five, pushing the LW into the inside channel and leaving the LCM to support our 6 in the middle of the park

when Zinchenko plays the width is held by our LW (more natural position for Gabi), the LCM is the inside channel of the front 5 (better opportunity for rotation with other forward, less defensive responsibility) and our LB supports our 6 in the middle (more technical ability, closer to area they have to defined / able to pressure counter attacks)

idk if that‚Äôs a ‚Äòtweak‚Äô or a different system entirely, but the results in both setups speak for themselves.",Arsenal,Yes,jah5xpc,t1_jah31d2
"I remember the speech people here gave me when I told them if we signed Raphinha, he'd displace someone in the XI( most likely Martinelli). 

It was this obvious with KT too the moment Arteta insisted that Zinchenko was a LB. Some of us were trying to make a case for KT by claiming Zinchenko would be a CM. Copium, if you may. 

So, why say all this.

A better player is a better player. These things of ""game X is for Y"" is just copium. Imagine we face Dyche Burnely and we bench Jesus for say, Weghorst.

His defending is pretty average, physically nowhere near the same player, never cuts out cross field passes either, just spins around like a lost child.

Then finally, his crossing is crap. They're always flat with bo whip on them so the vast majority of the time they hit the first man. Zinchenko is a better crosser than him too.

"I think it sailed the moment we moved on Vieira: not because they're similar players, of course, but because we chose to go in a different direction. We chose a development project of a wingfielder over a more conventional CM improvement.

It's possible we might throw him a line and haul him in on a free, but unless we made no other midfield signings, he'd need to be prepared to accept a rotational role in the squad.

"First of all, KT has played LB, LWB and LCB for us, so please explain how a man who can play several positions can be ""one dimensional"".

Second, maybe I just dreamt all this, but was he not our only attacking outlet in the beginning of Arteta's reign?  He'd overlap, Auba would cut inside and Laca would drop into the 10.  We won an F.A. Cup during that time and the following season our top 4 push unravelled because he an Partey were injured.  Doesn't sound like he let us down.

Third, tell me who was better than him at LB for Arsenal during his time until Zini showed up?   Because the overwhelming consensus from our fans, generally speaking, was that he was our guy, and whenever he was injured we missed him.  Zini joined and the inverted role completely changed the situation, unless you can explain it differently.

Genuinely interested to hear how you arrived at your conclusion because it is almost the exact opposite of anything I can recall about his time here.",Arsenal,Yes,jagt0kz,t1_jagskuw
"By letting us down you mean for injured? And you're comparing to Zinchenko. Who is justbas injury prone.

He's not 1 dimensional. Also having 1 dimensional players to round out your squad is fine. Especially when no one else does that 1 thing regularly. It's called tactical flexibility. Liverpool in their pomp had room for guys like Ox and Origi.",Arsenal,Yes,jagup49,t1_jagskuw
"I‚Äôm confused as to why people act as if Zinchenko can only underlap. Pretty certain the winning goal against Utd came from him overlapping on the LHS.

He is simply more versatile for our system. And despite his deficiencies in defense, his on the ball ability makes him more suited to our system.

I don‚Äôt think this means Tierney is a bad player and I disagree with the assertion that he ‚Äòlet us down‚Äô but it makes perfect business sense to sell him.",Arsenal,Yes,jagtw5a,t1_jagskuw

"AFAIK, there is no solid underpinning for foot-related advantages with CMs the way there is with CBs (which is itself often overstated, but does exist).

The short answer is that your dominant foot does offer different angles on either side, but that Arteta doesn't really want rigidly defined positions there; he's also clearly fine with playing two relatively left-footed players across the top of our midfield. Ideally they'd both be fully two-footed, but it's not a huge deal.

Think about that ball √òdegaard played to Martinelli against Brighton, and where he was when he played it. That's the kind of fluidity Arteta wants. He gets most annoyed when our attack becomes static. He'd love nothing better than to see √òdegaard threatening one set of angles on our right, then to have him pop up on our left, offering a different set of threats, with, say, ESR now operating on the right with Saka.

"Zinchenko inverted gimmick will last as long as Arteta lasts at this club. That gimmick is what allows us to dominate possession and pin down teams. 

Systems are bigger than players, an polished Tavares in the future will be an asset to an team like Chelsea/Tottenham but not for us cause we dont have wing back system similarly we no longer have an traditional LB system hence an traditional LB in Tierney is not suited to our system. 

Martinelli/Trossard are expected to maintain width cause that allows us to have more control in midfield since they essentially pull opponent defense along with them, narrow it down and we can be pressed swifter and higher chances of turnover and counter, it's not for nothing that we heard our coaches shout at Trossard to maintain width. So we will always have that width and traditional Lb bombing down the left and crossing isnt part of our plan.

When was the last time any team in premier league relied on lb/rb bombing down and crossing as an outlet for goals? Nketiah/Jesus aren't such strikers anyway.",Arsenal,Yes,jah6fi0,t1_jah022r

"I'd definitely want to keep him, but he is one of very few sellable assets who wouldn't be near irreplaceable.

The issue is where he fits into the attacking 235 -he's always going to be wide left, which isn't a problem, except that it means both the LW and LCM are naturally attacking the left half space. Easy solution is that the LCM drops into the left side of the 3 rather than the front line, except that means neutralising B2B Xhaka and putting him in the kind of position he has traditionally been vulnerable in. This rigidity gets worse when Nketiah is central and not rotating with the LW like Jesus and Trossard do. Someone in the team needs to play that role in the 3, and the only good options on the left are Zinchenko and then Tomi.

The people who say there is no place for a traditional LB are wrong, but we don't really have the midfield personnel to allow it unless we play Zinchenko at LCM with KT at LB, and starting both is a huge risk. And KT's best offensive attribute is rinsing someone on the outside and pinging in a cross, but we don't have the kind of CF or midfield runners that can get on the end of those, so it isn't worth changing things to fit him in, as good as he is.",Arsenal,Yes,jah5vea,t1_jah022r

"No we've spent almost the last year complaining that we don't ahve decent backup for partey, why the hell would you take that backup and open him up to potential injury *while still playing Partey*?",Arsenal,Yes,jahltap,t1_jahl1t9
No,Arsenal,Yes,jahmbo1,t1_jahl1t9
"While Jorginho could offer more than Xhaka in the final third, his total lack of mobility and athleticism would be even more obvious as an 8. Xhaka obviously isn't a world-beater in that respect either, but Jorginho makes him look like Zaha.

Jorginho shouldn't play 8 any more than Xhaka should play 6. He's a very good backup to Thomas, and we should be thankful for that.

When Thomas is fit, he'll start as the 6; the luxury of Jorginho, and the reason it was worth paying 13m for 18 (read: 6) months of him, is not having to rush Thomas back, and being able to rest him when needed.",Arsenal,Yes,jahmj9x,t1_jahl1t9
different players / positions . no,Arsenal,Yes,jahl680,t1_jahl1t9
"No. Partey can play 8, but there are several players better than him in that role, including Xhaka. In our system, it's either or with him and Jorginho, and we aren't going to suddenly switch to a double pivot just so we can play the two of them together.",Arsenal,Yes,jahllbj,t1_jahl1t9
more games for them is good for us. they'll hit a wall eventually.,Arsenal,Yes,jaji0x9,t1_jajgjpm
"We're 11 points ahead of them, so their league form clearly has faltered in comparison to us.

"Not sure where you are coming from here.  

I don't understand how a 4-2-3-1 would create an opportunity for any of those players.  You'd be taking away an advanced MF position and turning to a double pivot. 

The other formation is even less likely.",Arsenal,Yes,jahs7be,t1_jahpnmu
"3-5-2 (3-1-4-2, technically) is the 2nd formation, but is really only utilized when the squad is trailing. 

Outside of preseason, we‚Äôve only seen it at home vs Fulham, after Fulham went up 1-0 in the ~55‚Äô; Arteta subbed off Tierney (LB) for Nketiah, playing him centrally with Jesus, shifting Martinelli and Saka to WingBacks. 

We saw the formation a lot more last season, mainly due to the score line, and it was featured heavily in the preseason. This campaign, Arsenal have rarely found themselves behind, and they lack a certain personnel for the system, especially when Jesus went down.

Edit:

Here is a good write up on the tactic from arseblog, published in July

This is literally the most offensive post. ESR will play out his contract and will demand to be the first player to sign a lifetime deal. He will be on 50k for the rest of his life. He will then be the first player/manager to win the the Double before retiring to focus on winning back to back CL finals for the first time since 25 26. Don't talk about ESR and funding.,Arsenal,Yes,jagvnxd,t1_jaguije
"How did you read the whole article brev, it‚Äôs behind a paywall",Arsenal,Yes,jagv4ih,t1_jaguije
"No I would not. Unless we‚Äôre back to the early Emirates days, we should be looking to sell players who are definitely out of favour with Arteta‚Äôs system and ESR is still not there.",Arsenal,Yes,jagvz8l,t1_jaguije

"He's the best player in the league not on a traditional big 6 team.

It's a gap to anyone else (Caicedo, Mitoma, Paqueta, Maddison, Toney) etc.
I'd say Guimares/Maddison are the closest.",Arsenal,Yes,jahkh79,t1_jahk6wz
have u watched him play ?,Arsenal,Yes,jahlcc6,t1_jahk6wz
"I think I was in that camp but when you look at his stats, it's pretty insane for the team he's in. He has a lot of room to improve too. My faith in who Arteta wants is pretty huge too, if he wants to go all in for Rice. I'm backing it.   


If he becomes English captain too, we just have to stick in the box and watch the penalties for us rack up.",Arsenal,Yes,jahn0eq,t1_jahk6wz
"We don't think, we use facts and stats to evaluate. Rice is the most balance CM just behind SMS, stat by stat u can compare. He ain't god he isn't perfect, but he does everything u expect from a CM, though he excel at none (always the second best or third best in class); BUT he tick every box!!!! And that's his value.",Arsenal,Yes,jahv0dx,t1_jahk6wz
"We don‚Äôt knock balls into the box. We don‚Äôt overlap and cross. If we do cross it‚Äôs usually targeted, normally a cutback more than a cross. 

Trossard small nimble stature and quick feet is what‚Äôs needed. 

Arteta doesn‚Äôt do ‚Äútarget man‚Äù.",Arsenal,Yes,jagro15,t1_jagqsho
Personally I think we need him to drop deep and get around in small spaces in the box. The attack was much more fluid and dynamic against Leicester,Arsenal,Yes,jagr8hb,t1_jagqsho
"sambi will probably be sold

"I‚Äôm not trying to downplay Jesus‚Äô impact, but he has missed 11 of the 25 games we‚Äôve played now. The majority of our goalscoring improvement has come from our players being coached well and our overall control of games getting better, which is partly coaching and partly personnel. 

But our team hasn‚Äôt actually changed all that much since last season - Zinchenko, Saliba, and Jesus are really the only new players in the XI. Two of them are defenders and the other has missed 44% of our league games.

When did I say we‚Äôve done anything yet? Take that snark elsewhere.,Arsenal,Yes,jagukta,t1_jagueqh
fair but one thing people do when it comes to suggesting new players is they assume that what the current player brings to the team remains when they‚Äôre brought out and the new player will only add on the final missing piece. how much of our domination is because of xhaka looking after the backdoor and allowing the players around him the freedom to play their attacking game? it‚Äôs never just as simple as vieira/esr are better attackers than xhaka so lets play them from the start,Arsenal,Yes,jagv4c5,t1_jaguhov

Rice production and research have met unprecedented challenges in recent years.

"There are reports out today that Arteta wants a winger (likely to replace Nelson, i.e. Saka backup) and a left back. Tierney will leave (I don‚Äôt think he wants to be here if he can‚Äôt play whenever he‚Äôs fit), which is why we will need a left back.

But yeah, we have needed midfielders for a minute. Definitely need two IMO. Rice and Caicedo would be perfect.",Arsenal,Yes,jah03ic,t1_jagzutg

"Yes. There is a user who is the personification of hypocrisy on here.

Bro how dare yanks be on a yank website. Officer I‚Äôm right here ü§≤üèº,Arsenal,Yes,jahmd4d,t1_jahm9q7
"ppl love scapegoating in here

hell jorginho does a couple line break pass and suddenly you have people claiming he's better than Partey

i dont get it and it irks me a lot but it is what it is.

that being said i wouldn't mind selling Eddie. when you start getting success you can actually get good value on your players, whom will be deemed talented enough to start elsewhere and he def is. 

Arsenal hasn't been in this position in a long time, and to go for the likes of Rice/Jude you need those sales",Arsenal,Yes,jal5s17,t1_jajuv93
it‚Äôs classic /r/gunners to shit on underperforming players regardless of good things are going otherwise,Arsenal,Yes,jak1quo,t1_jajuv93
"A lot of people are saying Martinelli played better today because Eddie was dropped for Trossard, but Saka assisted Martinelli‚Äôs first goal after he rotated to the right wing, and Eddie literally assisted the second. It‚Äôs clear that Martinelli thrives in central areas, but that isn‚Äôt something that is impossible for Eddie to facilitate, and he showed that today. Yet I‚Äôm still seeing people single him out as not being good enough. He really deserves a bit more love from our fans.",Arsenal,Yes,jakihcg,t1_jajuv93
Ahhhh i see now. Makes sense cheers,Arsenal,Yes,jagx4oi,t1_jagwzqm
"Yessir. Being a sens fan has been rough, but like Arsenal, we are on an upward trajectory. Good times ahead",Arsenal,Yes,jak0fqg,t1_jak0b7n
"üòÇit‚Äôs rough. Supporting them and arsenal around 2018 was a tough, tough time..",Arsenal,Yes,jak19lq,t1_jak0xsg
u/phar0aht,Arsenal,Yes,jahu9y1,t1_jahu09d
These types of takes are so cringe.,Arsenal,Yes,jai6mxo,t1_jai2g4t
Wow so many scary corners with those Everton giants /s. Embarrassing levels of little man syndrome being scared of that lot when they come to the carpet.,Arsenal,Yes,jajn5oq,t1_jai2g4t
man said Fulham and Liverpool,Arsenal,Yes,jajpimu,t1_jajoxoi
Thing is we don't play City till late in the season. If we don't lose up until that point I think momentum will just keep us pushing along past City.,Arsenal,Yes,jajq654,t1_jajot6h
I still want to beat City if we win the title. Like Leicester won in style beating City while they won the title. I hope we have that one game ourself.,Arsenal,Yes,jajppw4,t1_jajot6h
"He's so good. We are scoring for fun without him at the minute, will be even more unstoppable.",Arsenal,Yes,jajqcti,t1_jajplmd
"Never said he hadn't considered it.

Not pretending it's a new idea. 

It's an old idea in fact. Taken from how Arteta used to use Tierney.

I think he should bring it back on occasion when the inverted LB isn't working.

You can get the same result from the inverted LB by asking your CM to play as an orthodox CM.",Arsenal,Yes,jah98dz,t1_jah8io4
"in actual matches, ZInchenko functions more like CM especially when we are attacking",Arsenal,Yes,jah82aa,t1_jah4k2m
Yeah the main thing is that when Zinchenko plays we have arguably our best progressive passer on the pitch. There's a reason Arteta never drops him.,Arsenal,Yes,jah8y5c,t1_jah4k2m
We had a numerical overload with the U too we were just bad at getting into midfield.,Arsenal,Yes,jah3ung,t1_jah3eyh
And I said we should use Tierney more. And it's not always a choice between Tierney and Zinchenko.,Arsenal,Yes,jagxtas,t1_jagxq0i
Played the role that didn't suit him. I'm advocating he play his natural game.,Arsenal,Yes,jagycn1,t1_jagy2w9
"You've named basically every style of football. Ten Haag like Arteta is a student of Pep and an advocate of positional play. They follow the same principles. Conte and Howe (atm) are counter punching teams with quick transitions. Klopp is a high press and counter press system, again with an emphasis on quick transitions.",Arsenal,Yes,jagv994,t1_jagv226
"He's mostly been trying to adjust to playing like Zinchenko so his form this season isn't good. I'd simplify his role and get him doing what he does best naturally again.

And it's not necessarily about what he does on the ball. It's his movement off the ball that makes the LW ahead of him effective. You know he's gonna bust his gut to overlap and remove the double team on that wing. He stays high and wide so he stretches the pitch and helps create that half space for the LW. He adds tactical variety by adding the destructive cutback back into our Arsenal of attacking weapons. Too often low blocks have been really comfortable defending because everything is happening in front of them. 

His defending might be average but it's definitely better than Zinchenko. He's superior 1v1 and has better positional sense.",Arsenal,Yes,jagvrmf,t1_jagvdt4
I agree he hasn't looked great this season except in Europa,Arsenal,Yes,jagvps8,t1_jagvdt4
And then we signed Jorginho,Arsenal,Yes,jah4oxc,t1_jah27bp
I would eat a $80 loss which i refuse so yolo,Arsenal,Yes,jaiu1g6,t1_jaitucc
$855,Arsenal,Yes,jaisks1,t1_jaisipa
it‚Äôs all good. I clawed some losses back by betting arsenal to win by 3+ and also saka first goalscorer so only lost a few hundred. Also we won and spurs crashed out of the cup so its a good day,Arsenal,Yes,jajqme6,t1_jajpmjz
"He‚Äôs out of contract, so definitely free. 

Not sure what (if any) kind of agreement the two sides reached/disgusted in the past 6-18 months of reported interest, but nothing has really changed on Arsenal‚Äôs end: they extended Elneny and signed Jorginho, who‚Äôs contracts would only overlap with Youri for a year. I think it‚Äôs more likely that the leap in the project may see the club look elsewhere, but Tielemans would still be a strong signing for the club, especially on a free.",Arsenal,Yes,jahbxpb,t1_jahb75w
Also because he's 3rd choice. If he was getting as many mins as Tomi I don't think he'd want to leave for Newcastle.,Arsenal,Yes,jagsrqk,t1_jagso18
Negotiations have begun. Tense.,Arsenal,Yes,jagt0ec,t1_jagsswy
More of an actor. Hoo-ah.,Arsenal,Yes,jah0j0z,t1_jagzynk
"> Is Pacino more of a defensive midfielder or an attacker?

Well Al-Pacino's most memorable roles have been of either methodical or crazy attackers haven't they. 

Jokes aside Charlie Patino is more of central midfielder, could be an 8 or a 6 or a double pivot player. Not necessarily a final third/final action guy like Fabio Vieira or ESR.",Arsenal,Yes,jah0d8j,t1_jagzynk
"He got a red card due to stupid challenges that's why he didn't play the game before last, don't know why he wasn't in the squad for the last game but could be a lesson from Mick McCarthy. 

Also, Blackpool fans love him what are you talking about.",Arsenal,Yes,jah20it,t1_jah1qh2
"Absolutely, he is also more powerful (or going to be) and faster than Jorginho and has a knack for carrying the ball too. So the potential is immense.",Arsenal,Yes,jah1sgs,t1_jah1k9c
Hopefully so :),Arsenal,Yes,jah0ub6,t1_jah0nxe
Man am i so happy to be wrong hahaha,Arsenal,Yes,jajfw48,t1_jah0nxe
Yet he averages 34.5 PL games a season and played a full championship season before that.,Arsenal,Yes,jahejhx,t1_jaheavk
"Liverpool went to 3 Champions League finals relying on their creative fullbacks. 

My general point is our system won't be unbeatable forever. The team will always need to evolve and having different players who are good at different things is always nice.",Arsenal,Yes,jah9r8h,t1_jah6fi0
I'd there a right way to football. Did Arteta invent it? Or did he maybe copy the same principles some of us were familiar with before Arteta.,Arsenal,Yes,jah3gmk,t1_jah11mu
"Everyone.

 He creates space by being a dummy option. And he can cut back. Or if he gets the ball on the wing the defence will send a player to him = more space for others. And it doesn't have to be a cross to a target man. A low cross into the 6 yard box any good scorer gamble's on. Or he could cut it back and replicate the city dynamic with midfielders running onto the ball. Or he can cross it far post and have Saka poach like Foden does for city backpost.",Arsenal,Yes,jah3dga,t1_jah1gj4
"Who did City cross to when they didn't have Haaland? You don't need 6'7 lampposts as your strikers to cross, it's all about space and timing, catching the opponents by surprise.",Arsenal,Yes,jaha48r,t1_jah1gj4
"So we're just ignoring the fact that Edu consistently fails to get his first targets? And no, Jorginho and Trossard being good doesn't mean that the first statement is wrong.",Arsenal,Yes,jahaww9,t1_jah8nv3
I didn't mention anything about Edu?,Arsenal,Yes,jah8sfy,t1_jah8nv3
I think this guy is more praising how good Rice would be compared to other signings than criticising Edu if we didn't sign him,Arsenal,Yes,jah91mg,t1_jah8nv3
Which Martinez are we talking about,Arsenal,Yes,jahmcyz,t1_jah8nv3
Sorry,Arsenal,Yes,jahcbks,t1_jah9xio
with better physical attributes than Jorginho. that all-touch compilation looks very very good.,Arsenal,Yes,jah8j7j,t1_jah3lmu
"Arteta's recent presser he was asked whether he wants goals spread around or someone who can score 25 themselves, he said both. 

200m for Rice, a forward like Leao or even Toney and a fullback or two is easily doable.",Arsenal,Yes,jah4bwc,t1_jah3tcu
"That's akin to a rebuild, no Partey no Xhaka.",Arsenal,Yes,jah7mjd,t1_jah6ppj
What about right wing?,Arsenal,Yes,jah8vo1,t1_jah5kxr
haha fair enough,Arsenal,Yes,jah6gej,t1_jah6amj
I have never wanted more to tag someone else's post with 'emphasis mine'.,Arsenal,Yes,jahmm75,t1_jahltap
"Are you saying something remotely positive about Xhaka ? It‚Äôs always strange seeing it from you, lovely though lol",Arsenal,Yes,jahvcaw,t1_jahmj9x
"Yeah, people underestimate how much positioning is a factor on how people can play. It's a bit like people saying Trent Alexander Arnold should play in the middle, playing as a full-back allows him so much more time than if he was central. It's the same for Jorginho, playing further back and having time and space to get your head up is a lot different to being expected to make supporting runs or track back from more advanced positions. Also you get way less time on the ball because you're being pressed way more the further up the pitch you are.",Arsenal,Yes,jahqp0p,t1_jahmj9x
"I was there the first time... however without the league it's just 'a' treble, not 'the' treble as Manu themsleves pointed out when liverpool did both domestic and the UEFA",Arsenal,Yes,jajnulb,t1_jajjwgh
Would probably have to stop reading anything outside of Arsenal specific stuff tbh lol,Arsenal,Yes,jajlfze,t1_jajjwgh
"Not to mention he is on a shit ton of money, which we won't be paying!",Arsenal,Yes,jagpogt,t1_jagpcr0
"Those are all fair points, he'd be a luxury rotation player that's for sure.",Arsenal,Yes,jagqe6s,t1_jagpcr0
"Mainly as striker, I suppose, rotating with Jesus.",Arsenal,Yes,jago5e5,t1_jagnmgt
Why do people in a Reddit forum have opinions that differ from my own,Arsenal,Yes,jagpy34,t1_jagnpw4
Why? What's wrong?,Arsenal,Yes,jago7y0,t1_jagnpw4
"I'd argue we are quite lacking in 8s that truly thrive in the role. Only Ode fits in my eyes. Obviously, we should see further development in Vieira, ESR etc. However, it may ultimately be akin to fitting square pegs through round holes.  


That said, Arteta shows a stubbornness in his ideals and I wouldn't be surprised if we show ruthlessness in the transfer market to reach them.",Arsenal,Yes,jahwlew,t1_jahrojb
"There is always natural evolution in the game and the best teams show their own tweaks too. The other two best teams in the league use 4-2-3-1 currently. Not that we should be copying them but with the squad we have, some players would certainly fit into it better.",Arsenal,Yes,jahxsi7,t1_jahvbha
"What don't you understand? Trossard has said himself he is a second striker type and his qualities are clearly suited in tight central areas, in which he can pull out impossible shots and short passes. He would 100% look better in the hole behind the striker than out by the touchline as a winger.   


ESR and Vieira are also central attacking mid types and haven't really shown the workrate, nor the defensive nous, to take over Xhaka or Ode's position. In a 4-3-2-1, the 10 doesn't have to drop so deep so they can play more like pure attacking midfielders.  


The 3-2-4-1 is a formation that Man City have used this season to break down deep blocks. It's one you probably wouldn't use in an even match up but it does provide the extra attacking player in games you expect to dominate.",Arsenal,Yes,jahvnno,t1_jahs7be
"Yeah, I remember seeing it a lot last season too. We could feasibly use it now with Nketiah and Trossard next to each other and maybe we have and I just haven't been paying attention.   


It is the equivalent of throwing extra forwards on when the opponents are trying to hold out the rest of the game in a deep block. Would look very different from the start of a game.   


Still different to what I'm suggesting though. You see Man City use 4-2-3-1 with Alvarez behind Haaland. In games they know they will control possession against a deep block, they run 3-2-4-1. We haven't played with a 10 since ESR days I think. Ode's inclusion in the team was the start of the move to 4-3-3.",Arsenal,Yes,jahtd11,t1_jahrjra
[deleted],Arsenal,Yes,jaguuxo,t1_jagunvl
He doesn't improve the players around him. That is a massive measure for greatness for me and he is not doing that.,Arsenal,Yes,jahl6u6,t1_jahkh79
Yes. But when you watch him play does he improve the players around him? Because I don't see him doing that at all.,Arsenal,Yes,jahlkhv,t1_jahlcc6
"I don't think we sell Joringho, he just takes over the El Neny role. I think Xhaka will rotate out but also be a commonly used sub. He could even become the backup LB in the system we play now, he is good cover for Zinny. I wonder about Partey, his injury record really kills us. He can't be first choice anymore I think, but you can't really keep him around as a squad / backup player.",Arsenal,Yes,jaht2rh,t1_jahpv2u
"I do see us selling Sambi. Don't see us selling Jorginho or Partey. Partey will only be 30 and still have 2 years left on his deal. Arguably one of our best players. Could see him not able to play depending on what happens with the legal situation. Assuming we sell Sambi and keep Partey and Jorginho our midfield depth would be:

Partey, Jorginho, Xhaka, Odegaard, Rice, new MF #2, ESR, Fabio. Also have Elneny for emergency depth and Patino (who I see getting loaned out again). ESR and Fabio can play on the wing, but they still won't get enough minutes to help them develop.",Arsenal,Yes,jahtwe4,t1_jahpv2u
Didn‚Äôt we sell giroud for Auba?,Arsenal,Yes,jagxaax,t1_jagw1rw
"Sideways move tbh. Laca was neither an upgrade or a downgrade. 

Giroud is like Emi Martinez. Everyone remember the big moments but forgets what he‚Äôs like across a full season. He‚Äôs inconsistent as fuck and has huge dry spells wheres he completely ineffective. Wasn‚Äôt good enough for Arsenal, wasn‚Äôt good enough for Chelsea",Arsenal,Yes,jagw97j,t1_jagw1rw
Is selling Giroud for Auba,Arsenal,Yes,jagw4bh,t1_jagw1rw
"Average passing range, poor shot, extremely one footed so very limited passing angles and much easier to press than a Bernardo Silva say. Doesn't mean he's a bad player, just don't think he's actually that good.",Arsenal,Yes,jahdhcg,t1_jahcxxx
Nope. Don't think he's even top three Arsenal player of the season. Saka & Partey easily take one & two. Then White & Gabriel. He might make the top five depending on how Jesus does when he's back.,Arsenal,Yes,jahjqef,t1_jahiqok
"Did you watch the game yesterday? He was shocking in the first half, pretty much all the issues I have with him came to the surface. He was brilliant in the second half... once we were two up",Arsenal,Yes,janrrnt,t1_janp76j
"If I just watched the highlights, I'd rate Odegaard higher.",Arsenal,Yes,jaqwv9c,t1_jaq56om
">Paqueta was the dream

If Paqueta is the dream, I'd like to know what a nightmare is. He is bang average and extremely overrated.",Arsenal,Yes,jahcbkl,t1_jahb6vi
Even with WC tax I would have paid only 70m max for Enzo,Arsenal,Yes,jags8ps,t1_jags6w2
You're mental if you're paying 80m for a LOAN,Arsenal,Yes,jagtd79,t1_jagt6ra

"Ah so it's a two match ban for 10 accumulated yellows and cup games no longer count. So strange, okay.",Arsenal,Yes,jah15fy,t1_jagyynk
Acestreams were better quality than the SkyGo login I had back then,Arsenal,Yes,jah43nk,t1_jah1n3e
No advantage to rushing this decision. We should be patient and see how it plays out,Arsenal,Yes,jahccoo,t1_jahbr2j
"We stuck by Xhaka and Gabriel through all their errors, and I know we‚Äôve outgrown that level but still, he‚Äôs not useless as some say",Arsenal,Yes,jahx6hw,t1_jahsz9g

Yea I noticed there isn‚Äôt much going on over there,Arsenal,Yes,jako27f,t1_jak8tv5
lmaooooo come on man,Arsenal,Yes,jagtwis,t1_jagtmtm
"I feel like you've responded without even reading my comment. We can forego the back door looking cause some teams don't even really look to attack us. They're playing for draws.

Also we have 3 rapid CBs looking to sweep up in behind as well. Xhakas defensive activity in this role isnt that high. He also plays ahead of the ball. He really doesn't do that much covering.",Arsenal,Yes,jagvfow,t1_jagv4c5
The fact is most of the shots/threats come from quick counters. There aren't many teams that play a possession number game with us.,Arsenal,Yes,jah19qe,t1_jaguhht
"You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs likely we wouldn‚Äôt get much for him, if anything. Obviously if we *can* sell him, I think it would be prudent to, but I doubt we‚Äôll be able to.",Arsenal,Yes,jaij6xm,t1_jaihok8

"In the future, more people are leaving the farming workplace for a ""better job"" in the city.",Arsenal,Yes,jagp8yz,t1_jagorao
Whatever happened to golden rice? I remember learning about that in GCSE geography. Did that go anywhere?,Arsenal,Yes,jagp5d3,t1_jagorao
Even if we don‚Äôt sell Tavares we need another LB üòÇ,Arsenal,Yes,jah0b66,t1_jah034d
ESRs not kicked a ball this season. That's your winger. Selling Tierney would be a mistake.,Arsenal,Yes,jah0g9h,t1_jah03ic

"How many of those games are starts? I still think there will be teams who will look at his Brazil WC goals and Everton tape, and write off his Tottenham stint as being due to bad fit and lack of starts.

"He'd suit Brentford perfectly if Toney is banned, and they create a lot more than Palace.",Arsenal,Yes,jai9icp,t1_jai5yq9
"I think we will keep a core group for the next 5 - 6 years. But if we are still run by the Kroenke's in 8 years, they will have recycled the players after a 5 year build. I think you'll find they apply american sports team builds. I would love to see Saka and ESR win an FA Cup in a dual retirement. I just think it will be ESR who will retire here.",Arsenal,Yes,jagzk09,t1_jagyqy1
"It's also very, very rare for English players to move to those teams.

Their fans would prefer a South American or whatever player, the players largely prefer to stay in England as well.",Arsenal,Yes,jagxy7t,t1_jagxqmu
I would love to see Saka make it another 7 years. But I think by 25 to 28 he will have the brand or desire to move to Madrid or Barcelona. I hope that we will compete with City continuously and a move to city wouldn't be a career upgrade. I think by 28 he will get big pay day contract. It may be 2029 and he will move to an Italian club and will win a CL and a league double the next year.

"his game does seem a bit 'English' and workmanlike, that can be good and bad, but mainly its his **physique**...his body does not give me confidence that he will be bossing midfields into his thirties...i think he has five good years left in him, and even then, teams will be able to bully him in that time...he's not especially tall or strong or fast or technical, or anything really",Arsenal,Yes,jai4mb4,t1_jai3thm

"The result speaks, enough said. There were times we rely on Tierney's crosses since our midfield can't progress the ball.",Arsenal,Yes,jah5rmv,t1_jah4kr3
I think we lose something in the buildup if both Xhaka and Tierney are playing and no Zinchecko. We won't be bad by any means like we showed at Brentford but against high pressing sides it will be more difficult for us.,Arsenal,Yes,jah1mqt,t1_jah1fux

Playing Tierney doesn't equate to dropping Zinchenko,Arsenal,Yes,jah9n4y,t1_jah8y5c
Now count me the ' numerical' advantage in midfield playing Tierney.,Arsenal,Yes,jah4vpa,t1_jah3ung
"Yep and quite obviously Arteta disagrees with you, which I pointed out when I said Arteta chose to use Tomiyasu ahead of him. Very obvious how Arteta wants to play. Just because you don't agree doesn't mean the manager is wrong.",Arsenal,Yes,jagy3pb,t1_jagxtas
"So, you correctly assess that Arteta plays him as an inverted wing back, and Tierney cannot play that role. Why do you think Arteta would ever change his system to fit an inferior player? Arteta clearly puts a heavy emphasis on positional play in his training drills, and that would all get thrown out of the window if Tierney gets to play his natural role. There is no real benefit in doing so, and the evidence is in the fact that Arteta does not play him there and won't play him there.",Arsenal,Yes,jagypmx,t1_jagycn1

"All this stuff you are listing doesn't seem to be anything Arteta really cares about or values. Tomiyasu has started the same amount of games as Tierney at LB in the PL. He is also injury prone, and on one of the highest salaries in our team for someone who doesn't play. 

Also forgetting the most important part. The guy 100% will want to leave after playing 4 PL games so far. 

I agree with u/burtspangles. He's overrated because he's a great, normal guy.",Arsenal,Yes,jagwq1p,t1_jagvrmf
"What's the point of him holding the width when he does nothing with it? I'd rather Martinelli be wide because he can actually go both way. If we're keeping a player because of where he stands, something is going wrong. Zinchenko could easily stay wide if asked to.

Tierney is slightly better 1v1, but not by much as he's massively fell off in that area. He gets walked past almost as much as Zinchenko now. Zinchenko is more active in our counterpress, he & Xhaka always first to react and win it back.",Arsenal,Yes,jagw7nv,t1_jagvrmf

"Liverpool went to 3 champions league finals creating a system that worked for them and sticking to it, it would make sense for us to stick to our system as well. 

Tierney does not fit the system, if he can start playing the inverted role and is happy with limited game time he will stay. Pretty sure liverpool didnt alter their system during their golden phase to satisfy one single player.

"It's a fair point, and you're absolutely right that √òdegaard is the model of our 8s. This is one of the reasons I kept saying in the summer that we needed another midfield signing, and I was surprised Arteta wasn't, as you say, a little more ruthless here.

That said, ESR and Vieira are perhaps closer to being able to do what √òdegaard does (speaking generally rather than specifically) than it might seem-- in part because √òdegaard is closer to a wingfielder than it might seem: much like both of them, he played out wide a good deal when he was on loan in Spain, and still, drifts wide regularly in switching with Saka. He's mastered the limited CM aspects of our wide/advanced 8 roles more than they have, but those are both a surprisingly small part of that role, and well within the abilities of ESR and Vieira.",Arsenal,Yes,jahxpm8,t1_jahwlew

I am not 100% on the current situation but there's basically a bunch of controversy about it and most countries where it's intended to be used haven't allowed it to be grown.

Statistically he's one of the best in terms of winning duels. Nobody is bullying rice right now. 

How long that lasts I dunno, if you see something that makes you think that won't last, fine.

I‚Äôm not 100% convinced either, think there might be better options for the insane fee West Ham want. But you haven‚Äôt watched him enough if you think he‚Äôs none of those things, his strength to me is that he‚Äôs kind of a ‚ÄúJack of all trades‚Äù which does make sense since we want our 6 to do literally everything you can imagine in a game of football",Arsenal,Yes,jai83jv,t1_jai4mb4

I mean that could be down to the manager trying new things to turn the results around. McCarthy is also a pragmatic manager.

3 goals between Martinelli and Zinchenko in our last two.... Add in Trossard off the left against Brentford and 4 of our last 9 goals have come off the left.,Arsenal,Yes,jagyl27,t1_jagye7s
"> He does already. He makes minor tweaks like this basically every game.

Minor tweaks in that Ben White will sometimes tuck in as a third CB or push more forward depending on the opposition, however you won't see Saka play as a wide midfielder, nor will you see Odegaard play box to box. They have clear, defined roles on the pitch that Arteta rarely deviates from. Tierney bombing down the left flank as a traditional full back is a deviation too far, imo. 

> Positional play isn't rigid. We've already seen Arteta play 4231, 433, 343 and 352 with the same positonal play principles.

3 at the back is never played anymore unless there's an early red card or Arteta's seeing out the game. The 4231 and 433 distinction is basically just if Xhaka drops deep to help build up play, or he pushes on to create space for Partey and Zinchenko to drive through, it has nothing to do with Tierney, and since Lokonga has been loaned out I've not seen a 4231 played(Maybe the City game at times, but that's debatable).

"Availability is the no.1 most important football quality, no use calculating an average of the games he's played per season across all seasons as he's started having knee / hip issues since last season.

"U can't tell nobody the benefits outweigh the cons in using Tierney, yet u question others opinions. Tierney can't underlap and is only good at putting in crosses, cross to EVERYONE? And u claim u know better?",Arsenal,Yes,jah8vs1,t1_jah6443
"They won't have the possession if they cross a lot, I hope u understand the underlying fundamental basic of Pep's system is to keep possession. Fact (source: Fbref) City KDB has more than 50% of their entire crosses, and that's from middle of the pitch , switching sides (KDB 177; Grealish 40; Mahrez 52) . let's back up our argument with facts.",Arsenal,Yes,jahhcks,t1_jahd9go

Just an astonishingly bad take.",Arsenal,Yes,jahfebp,t1_jahf7mf
"Might there be some introspection?

When you say a player is bad at something, and they are literally top 1-3 at said thing in the league, or all of Europe at their position, how does that not make you question your opinion?

"
He does not ‚Äúnormally fuck it up‚Äù. 83% pass accuracy and 92nd percentile for progressive passes. From attacking midfield, those are insane stats.

"i agree he's got good ball retention but that doesn't stop the other team trying to bully him off the ball. it creates something of a target for teams to look for, right now it's long balls over to the striker because they can't get through us, if we have what appears to be a 12 year old boy trying to stop them perhaps we get played through more",Arsenal,Yes,jagwnd7,t1_jagvxb5
"You are seriously over-valuing height. Being tall is a marginal advantage at best - it doesn‚Äôt even guarantee that you‚Äôre good in the air. Jota is great with his head and he‚Äôs small, Weghorst is not a particularly strong aerial threat despite being lanky as fuck.  Overall quality is far more important. Having your striker be tall is an insignificant bonus, not something that you should seek out for its own sake.",Arsenal,Yes,jah6i84,t1_jah650r
Wenger would be proud of you.,Arsenal,Yes,jahbxxq,t1_jahbgdt
"like I've said, just go watch. 

Martinelli is not the most forward player when the team is out of possession neither is he in the middle. he's at the touchline for multiple periods and tracking back at the wing. he roams inside sure, but most of his goals aren't in the middle of the box. neither are saka's. or robben's. or Ribery's...

yea, obviously wide players gonna score in the middle from time to time. but in Ronaldo's case it's the opposite, he scored them in the middle most of the time, because that's where he was when his team had possession. he wasn't holding width or touching the touch line.

again, UCL final 08/09 is on YouTube, Ronaldo is the center most of the front and the furthest forward player, up until Fergie decided to put berbatov, tevez, rooney and Ronaldo together in a desperation move üòÇ

anyways, if Ronaldo was at the touchline holding width and tracking back to defend like a proper winger he wouldn't have as many goals, so comparing him as the same as actual wingers is just wrong imo. same for Messi too btw 


not sure what the point is about odegaard. he's a midfielder, midfielder usually scoring from the... middle.",Arsenal,Yes,jalg4mg,t1_jalapst

It's not necessarily about link up. it's about spacing. It gives Martinelli more space to receive in dangerous areas. Also it would be Zinchenko coming in for Xhaka too.,Arsenal,Yes,jah2mt3,t1_jah24qc
Doesn't change my point. Bar the last game they've been poor for a month minimum.,Arsenal,Yes,jagyq60,t1_jagyl27
"Read your 1st sentence again and tell me why it's impossible for that to be done for Tierney üòÇüòÇüòÇ

What does saying we use 352 to see out games sometimes change. My point it it's a system that doesn't compromise Arteta style of play or principles.

Thanks for agreeing. This can all be seen as optimising his style üëçüèø",Arsenal,Yes,jah08ru,t1_jagzyxb
"Tierney is not getting in that United team either. Not technically secure enough, too one footed",Arsenal,Yes,jagw2nn,t1_jagvv5k
Other way round. Could easily be 1A and 1B to prevent us making another transfer we don't have to. I'd be ecstatic if we went big on 2 midfielders as our only signings. Almost every other position has players growing into the role and improving over time.,Arsenal,Yes,jagy7u7,t1_jagxl02
"Well no. It's easier to hold the width as a left footed on the left Vs a right. You're natural movement is into space. And inverted wingers natural movement is into more pressure.

And as stated. The design needs improvement as indicated by the poor form of Xhaka and Martinelli. What we're doing on the side right now needs improvement.",Arsenal,Yes,jagx2r4,t1_jagwu94
You think I'd be wasting my good luck in Arsenal injury news and not betting if I was lucky? Bozo,Arsenal,Yes,jah7iq5,t1_jah6rl2
Didn't really do anything. Occasionally hot injury and lineup news before officially announced. Would sometimes share it on this sub,Arsenal,Yes,jahay0r,t1_jah9wco
Sorry I didn't see you edited your comment. Who you thinking of? I would be suprised if we bought Caicedo and Rice like was rumoured in Jan but wouldn't mind that sort of route.,Arsenal,Yes,jahgiks,t1_jahg679
He did play 35 PL games last season though. I've heard of his possible injury issues but was was wondering what people thought tactically.,Arsenal,Yes,jahjhn1,t1_jahgpdy
Done it multiple times.,Arsenal,Yes,jah9bof,t1_jah8vs1

"You're coming at me and you don't even know what Edu does, fair enough.",Arsenal,Yes,jaiu4tz,t1_jahwuc7
"i believe you. I am not able to assess his speed in this clips.

So a career of great vs one 'bad' year. Zinchenko and Partey are our main progressors anyway so the relevance to an Odegaard/Bernardo Silva debate doesn't tally up.,Arsenal,Yes,jahfye6,t1_jahfebp
"If I had three players in our squad to be bearing down on goal and faced with picking the right pass to runners either side or taking a shot themselves, Odegaard wouldn't be in my top 3. Vieira, Smith Rowe, Martinelli, Jesus & Saka all more reliable in those situations. Says it all really.",Arsenal,Yes,jahg932,t1_jahfyqt

"If a pass is played behind someone, taking them out of their stride, is it a successful pass? (In the context where a pass infront of them would be better?.) Statistically it's a successful pass, reality is it's not.",Arsenal,Yes,jahghdy,t1_jahg5xb
We play 3 6 foot plus CBs..that's the deterrent to long balls. Not the CM who spends most of the game in line with our striker.,Arsenal,Yes,jagwv43,t1_jagwnd7
One tall player that could hold up the ball with his back to goal and contribute passing assists. An ariel threat for 60 mins or 30 at the end that gives the opponent a few thing to think about during long balls and late corners.

"I don‚Äôt think we need Tierney at LB to put Martinelli into dangerous areas. Zinchenko, and whoever is playing in the 9 can rotate or overlap just fine.

"Tierney for Zinchenko in any circumstance or any role is not an improvement, that's the issue. Tavares for Zinchenko is more of an 'improvement' in very specific situations, Tierney never.",Arsenal,Yes,jagx6vd,t1_jagx2r4
"I also don‚Äôt buy getting both of those players. I think Rice and then someone under the radar for the left 8 role who won‚Äôt command a top fee.

"Vieira?

Jesus christ.

He's literally never done that in his professional career. A sample size of ""believe me bro.""

"Every player does that so what. You need to understand he makes us tick, he‚Äôs our best chance creator this season, Arteta trusts him to be captain, and he‚Äôs playing fantastic football. Why can‚Äôt you see that?",Arsenal,Yes,jahgt52,t1_jahghdy
"i'm not saying the cm is the deterrent to long balls, i'm saying xhaka is part of the deterrent to being played through. if you can't get through then you go over. if vieira is there instead of xhaka then the option to go through becomes available",Arsenal,Yes,jagx5c3,t1_jagwv43
"You don‚Äôt need to be tall to hold the ball up. Jesus has some of the best hold up play in the world and he‚Äôs not tall.

"i mean, you can go right now check, say, saka v haaland's shotmap for this season and tell me if you can spot the difference. now which ones looks closer to Ronaldo's? easy answer...

more importantly, like I've said, he was literally in the middle of the front 3 on a UCL final with man u. wasn't the first time either. def shouldn't be some revelation.

Don't be a baby. Suggesting a tactical tweak doesn't mean I wanna sack everyone. Being top doesn't mean we're perfect and don't make errors.,Arsenal,Yes,jagz4h3,t1_jagyxus

You've seen it and replied several times.,Arsenal,Yes,jah9ttn,t1_jah9qu6
"Vieira's a way more talented final action player. If you look at Vieira's goal contributions this season in a highlight reel, they rival Odegaard's in terms of quality and one's played way more minutes. 

Vieira's issue is the intangibles, and it's where Odegaard shines. The intelligence to actually find the spaces to get into those positions, Odegaard does it brilliantly, always find himself in pockets to cock up the final action. Shame really.",Arsenal,Yes,jahhnqh,t1_jahgdvn
"Zinchenko & Partey are way more important to making us tick. Of course he's our best chance creator, Jesus has been injured half the season & Xhaka is our other eight, oh and not to mention, that's literally his primary function in the team. He's a fine player, just a bit limited.",Arsenal,Yes,jahh8jw,t1_jahgt52
I really don't think it's an important factor. They're always gonna play to space before looking to play through a body. We leave plenty of space when we attack.,Arsenal,Yes,jagxb24,t1_jagx5c3
I think a slight height advantage in set piece situations and late in the game would be a plan B. I think it could provide another option. Just a tall option in certain situations. I think we have a creative group. They would probably ping 1 2s off his forehead to recreate the Norwich goal.,Arsenal,Yes,jahapgl,t1_jah9wce

"This is completely wrong. 

Vieira is more of a Bruno Fernandes type. They try riskier passes at a higher percentage than a player like Odegaard. That does not make him better or more talented.

Regardless of what you think it‚Äôs without a doubt the worst some of our best players have looked. Mount may not be one of our best now but was one of the best in the CL run and no matter what you think about him he has talent in him. However, he has looked woeful under Potter.

The club clearly has a ton of issues, and those might be excuses for poor results, but the strongest argument for sacking Potter has been the lack of heart/a plan on the pitch - that for me is inexcusable. 

What I saw yesterday was finally a whole team playing with desire, energy and commitment.

My point is we all thought Potter is an attacking coach but his XG made fool all of us he is very defensive mind of a coach who can't even set his team properly.

We have lots of grate individual players and part of main reason we are not conceding too many goals.

We haven't see any direction where are we going.

You can see Mourinho and Simeone are a defensive mind coach but we all know when there teams won the ball they attack so fast and so precise and they don't just bend over teams like Leeds and Southampton.

And this coward changes all his attacking options at 60 minutes mark. I mean defensive changes are ok but when others team press high to get a goal then your team must have a fast winger to counter attack No?

We‚Äôre getting into dangerous positions and creating chances.  I can‚Äôt think of another stretch of games, where we‚Äôve been so unlucky in front of goal.  I might be off by a game, but I feel like Felix has hit the woodwork every game he‚Äôs been back from suspension.  He‚Äôs going to start making those.  Guaranteed.  Sterling has to make that pass, also.  That was a gimme.  Kante is soon to be back and if he‚Äôs good to go, I can‚Äôt wait to see him and Enzo operate.  Some were saying Chilly lost a step since he recovered, but fuck that, my boy was rapid today.  Once James is back again (any word on his hammy?), anyways.  It‚Äôs coming fellas.  Whether Potter has anything to do with it, or not.  This group will start getting things going soon.

"James was injured 60% of his time here so yeah

But James along with Kante were 2 best players in that CL final",Chelsea,Yes,jb18l9r,t1_jb181ul
"Agreed but James has a higher ceiling. RJ could be, and has been at times IMO, the best RB in the world. Mount is good but will never be the best in the world at his position",Chelsea,Yes,jb24tij,t1_jb181ul
"Mount is an extremely replaceable player. James not so much, even with his poor fitness levels",Chelsea,Yes,jb27orf,t1_jb181ul
Absolutely,Chelsea,Yes,jb19t9a,t1_jb181ul
"And against one of the most in-form teams in European football.

We have problems with scoring, but we also haven't beaten *any* of the top 10 teams in the league. We've been bottom feeders all season.",Chelsea,Yes,jb2mb4t,t1_jb1jb4d
"Surely you agree that we also could have a few more goals?  

Felix was unlucky and one of Havertz or Chilwell could have easily scored... if we are speaking in hypotheticals about the fact that ""Leeds could have scored"", that is.....",Chelsea,Yes,jb0lb9p,t1_jb0ecod
"The team was quite organized yesterday, how do you think they weren‚Äôt? Pretty much controlled the game on the ball and off, created chances.

When I come on this sub the comments are almost night and day different from talking about the game with my friends, most of which were actually at the match.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0ilez,t1_jb0ecod
I spoke to a Forest fan yesterday and the first thing they said was that we looked much better. I didn't even ask what they thought. I thought so too but wasn't sure if it was copium or not but really I think we're being overly critical if anything.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0ua57,t1_jb0ecod
I despise the formation but you are right. Getting the best out of Reece and Chilly might be the only way we start scoring some goals,Chelsea,Yes,jb0zlr4,t1_jb0vke2
But‚Ä¶ but ‚Ä¶ Todd wants 4-4-3,Chelsea,Yes,jb18q9v,t1_jb0vke2

"If teams refunded supporters after poor performances.

Clubs managed by Graham Potter would be like charities.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1eu4t,t1_jb1ei22
Well issue is that our pressing players is really only havertz that does it with conviction and energy (add to that sometimes chillwell does a decent job om the wing),Chelsea,Yes,jazfgdt,t1_jazea65
"Glad to have finally been able to win but yeah I agree with your assessment. I didn't see any improvements performance wise, especially our off the ball pressing. 

We have a lot of quality to force our way to win against midtable and lower table oppositions but our tactical approach needs improving by a lot if we're to progress under Potter.",Chelsea,Yes,jazqj56,t1_jazfr7c
At least until the players have a pre season to play a 433 with a CDM.,Chelsea,Yes,jazqbbr,t1_jazoqt7
It's a shame they're both injury prone then,Chelsea,Yes,jb05i47,t1_jazoqt7
Liverpool have to score 4 goals and not concede. Scoring 4 is not completely crazy even though very hard. Holding Madrid to zero goals at home in the Cl is another thing. Otherwise you're talking about scoring 5+,Chelsea,Yes,jb1n6ir,t1_jb1jtpt
"It‚Äôs too late for us, I don‚Äôt see Potter pulling out 13 wins in a row. Probably be fortunate to win 5 more games this season.

But if we get past a high flying Dortmund then I‚Äôd be supportive of letting him finish the season",Chelsea,Yes,jb2x38b,t1_jb2s7ww
"This might be an unpopular opinion, but missing out on top 4 may be for the better IMO. We‚Äôve seen Chelsea win all of the Europa, UCL, CWC and Super Cup in just the past 4 years. Whereas we haven‚Äôt seem then win a domestic cup in 5 or even put up a title challenge in 6. Personally, I‚Äôm tired of seeing Chelsea be so mediocre domestically",Chelsea,Yes,jb33qab,t1_jb2s7ww
"I feel like losing Mount could be a huge mistake, especially if the replacement is Joao Felix who Atleti is asking 100M+ for",Chelsea,Yes,jb05pfi,t1_jb049lh
Now they are sucking Seven Haag d*ck,Chelsea,Yes,jb30y2n,t1_jb1wq4v
Lot of them were bangers tbh. Almost triple the xg.,Chelsea,Yes,jb26ihl,t1_jb1wq4v
"I‚Äôm wondering if some of these lot are United fans, they are downvoting me for telling them to enjoy the game for once and stop thinking about Chelsea all day.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1xww9,t1_jb1wq4v

*We get a result but don‚Äôt play well*

‚ÄúWHO CARES ABOUT THE RESULT? WE LOOKED AWFUL!‚Äù",Chelsea,Yes,jb21zoz,t1_jazire4
I'm sad I slept through our first goal in forever![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob),Chelsea,Yes,jaznodc,t1_jazire4
And the other 40% are unhappy with the unconvincing way we played,Chelsea,Yes,jazkpzk,t1_jazire4
"Yeah, it's great to win, but at what cost does it come. 



Liverpool have had a horrible season and yet their manager has clawed them back up the table and they're now capable of going into the top 4 if they win their 2 games in hand. If our owners want to believe they have their own Klopp then they need to expect the same of him. 



We were neck and neck for ages and now they're without touching distance of top 4 and we're celebrating a win that keeps us ahead of 11th place on goal difference.",Chelsea,Yes,jazjylr,t1_jazigkh
Love seeing Alonso in a good team for once,Chelsea,Yes,jb1292q,t1_jb102c2
"Only manager who has not valued Mount. We might have to question his assessment skills. Or maybe it's down to player profile, but it's stupid not to extend a versatile player like Mount.",Chelsea,Yes,jaztski,t1_jazsyex
He's also been dropped by Southgate recently though and he always played him before.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0x57a,t1_jazsyex
"So how do you propose we utilise mount?

How should he be featuring in our current chelsea squad?",Chelsea,Yes,jazts1r,t1_jazsyex
"As seen by your previous comments, you are a mason mount fanboy over a chelsea fan. Mount let down Tuchel too. We play better when he‚Äôs not starting. But yes he definitely deserves 250k a year",Chelsea,Yes,jb2812o,t1_jazsyex
10am UK time.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0e5kx,t1_jb02jfm
"I think Klopp is the main reason their forwards are good. If we had the same players pool have, they would be playing worse here I have no doubt.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1abao,t1_jb18jq6
I don't think Nunez is a world beater and I don't think he'll become one. Other than him it's crazy the success they have up front.,Chelsea,Yes,jb1937s,t1_jb18jq6
"Seriously, I‚Äôm jealous of their ability to mail their big signings for the most part",Chelsea,Yes,jb24llr,t1_jb18jq6
"Not just his short stint here so far his end product wasn't there in Madrid either. There is reason despite being one of the highest paid players in the world he's on loan here. He's a flashy player but needs a system and team that is built around him to get end product. With Potter's system and the players that play around him, he's just not going to work. Screams another Havertz to me.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0rjqw,t1_jb0prcq
"Look at raw attributes. Felix is better on the ball and a lot quicker. Defences have to specifically pick him up.

If we work out a defined style of play and add some structure to his approach he‚Äôs a lot more threatening than Mount.",Chelsea,Yes,jb11cjs,t1_jb0prcq
It‚Äôs wholly unfair to compare felix currently to the best of mount considering felix has just joined and we have a horrible manage at the Helm with barely a system implemented So far and many new players to integrate,Chelsea,Yes,jb0qbdo,t1_jb0prcq
"Buying Felix for ¬£100 million and getting rid of Mount is terrible business. And I‚Äôm not even a big Mount fan. I think he is overrated by some here since he‚Äôs English and a Cobham boy. But he is also getting slated way too hard currently, and he can be very good.",Chelsea,Yes,jb10l8y,t1_jb0prcq
United never win at Anfield. It‚Äôs basically like us against Spurs without Potter.,Chelsea,Yes,jb1bcj7,t1_jb1aqke
"3 losses in their last 33 games. I'm gonna have to disagree, Scored 52 goals in the same time we've scored... 7. One flukey result doesn't change their resurgence under 10Hag",Chelsea,Yes,jb1mtae,t1_jb1ku0r
"Oh boys, the 'fans' in my country are moaning about the game.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0ia2r,t1_jb09l7c
Fucking pitiful man,Chelsea,Yes,jb0el0q,t1_jb09l7c
"Havertz hasn't been playing well for a long time. Unfortunately, we don't have an option.",Chelsea,Yes,jazuzdv,t1_jazsoou
I still personally want potter gone. He's not a manager that will be able to go head to head with managers like klopp and pep like tuchel did imo. We will be playing way better under a better manager,Chelsea,Yes,jazs5ac,t1_jazndu6
Speaking of mental gymnastics. You just did an entire routine here. We were doing anything different under Tuchel this season. The same problems that Potter is having Tuchel was as well. Poor health among irreplaceable players. No competent striker since Diego Costa left.,Chelsea,Yes,jazpgjh,t1_jazndu6
We should‚Äôve won it tbh.,Chelsea,Yes,jb269np,t1_jb1m87i
We need a new coach more a striker or a cdm my guy.,Chelsea,Yes,jb2shnm,t1_jb276eb
"I'm convinced we're ultimately just going to be wasting time under Potter if form improves. But as a fan I can't be unhappy with us winning and picking up form, anything otherwise and you'd want to re-assess your position as a fan of the club. I just reserve serious doubts over our ability to win any trophies under Potter. If we're thereabouts around top 4 I can see this board just sticking with him stubbornly so he succeeds. A world class manager gets this squad winning immediately, look no further than Ten Hag to see how quick progress can be under a great manager.",Chelsea,Yes,jaztr5m,t1_jazda46
">It‚Äôll be the most fantastic thing.

No one would see it that way. This isn't some underdog story -- we were acquired for 4 billion pounds and we've spent another 600m pounds in the last two windows. It should be seen as an inevitability that we succeed, not a huge accomplishment. 

The only reason it feels that way is because we've got this garbage manager and a board that has managed to gaslight this entire fanbase into lowering their standards so much that a 1 nil win against 17th place Leeds from a goal that came off a random set piece header is considered a huge win.",Chelsea,Yes,jaze7gp,t1_jazda46
I am not convinced by Potter but I want him to do well. People wanting the team to lose just so that they can karma farm here or get validation on Twitter are screwed in the head.,Chelsea,Yes,jazkyeb,t1_jazda46
Finally someone with a level headed take,Chelsea,Yes,jazegs7,t1_jazda46
"Despite playing good initially, I'm starting to go off the idea of buying him completely. He's not worth blowing another 100m for and that's a fact. We seem to be obsessed with going after SS and players with no defined positions. Fucking hate it, buy players who know exactly what to do in that area and are accomplished at it. Buy a fucking striker!",Chelsea,Yes,jazsfqz,t1_jazr4pc
"Yeah fuck buying talented players when we can struggle with mount and Gallagher instead

Propah blues",Chelsea,Yes,jazthza,t1_jazr4pc
True youth english obssessed fanboy lol,Chelsea,Yes,jazwfia,t1_jazr4pc
I'd personally sell mount and Gallagher but instead of getting felix I would go back for that Russian kid zakharyan as back up to nkunku next season. If we can't sign the russian kid because of the whole conflict with russia and ukraine then use carney as a  backup cam. Honest question. Do You think mount wants to be a bench player? Do you think mount starts over nkunku?. When nkunku comes in there's no way in hell mount starts over him,Chelsea,Yes,jazrwqv,t1_jazr4pc
"I watch Chelsea, games between big 6 clubs, and UCL",Chelsea,Yes,jb3i62y,t1_jb2n5t9
"Only chelsea, sometimes others if out with friends or if I have nothing to do",Chelsea,Yes,jb2qzng,t1_jb2n5t9
I only watch chelsea games and the finals of the champions league and maybe 6/7 interesting other teams' matches per season.,Chelsea,Yes,jb2o6c9,t1_jb2n5t9
"Only chelsea typically. I don‚Äôt watch other games from the premier league as I find them pretty dull.

I have watched some Napoli games this season because Kvara and Osimhen are a super exciting duo",Chelsea,Yes,jb2x9cg,t1_jb2n5t9
"Nowadays, I‚Äôll only watch if they‚Äôre close to our match and I‚Äôm bored. 

Still love footy in general, just that there‚Äôs less time to really sit down and catch every game while balancing your own life. Timezones are also a bitch for some of us.",Chelsea,Yes,jb3qt6r,t1_jb2n5t9
"I only watch Chelsea, with the exception of internationals where I watch England and then I also watch countries that have prominent Chelsea players in them, for example I have watched a lot of Spain over the years for Azpilicueta, Mata, Torres etc. 

Football games are 90 minutes minimum, I don't have time or the invested interest to watch other teams face each other.  I'll watch a 3 minute Sky Sports highlight if something really notable happens though.  

Plus, watching teams I don't like, do well, isn't really worth my time. 

Take today for example, Liverpool 7 - Man United 0 is funny, but still, cba to watch 90minutes of Liverpool having a great time, I significantly hate the scousers, so I would rather watch a 3 minute supercut of Man United have a terrible time haha.

Or watching Arsenal do a comeback and win 3-2. I don't need that negativity in my life. I only have one life & I would rather it be full of as many good moments in it as possible. Rather just read the result of those games.  

Now, let's say it was that time where Chelsea thrashed Arsenal 6-0 on Wenger's 1000th game in charge, I did watch that in full & loved every second. :)",Chelsea,Yes,jb2p8kr,t1_jb2n5t9
Can‚Äôt believe I stayed up to watch less than 3 mins of this fight smh,Chelsea,Yes,jazi1be,t1_jazfehf
That was embarrassing. Thankfully my friend paid for the PPV but that wasn't worth whatever the fuck it was.,Chelsea,Yes,jaziqn2,t1_jazfehf
One of the most disappointing fights I have ever seen. Could have told me he was paid off and I would have believed you lol.,Chelsea,Yes,jazpnut,t1_jazfehf
"Why are you acting like they aren‚Äôt offering him a contract?

It‚Äôs mount the one rejecting us",Chelsea,Yes,jazxaxx,t1_jazutsd
Why would we want the worst manager in the clubs history to ruin another season?,Chelsea,Yes,jb0lt7r,t1_jb0bj95
"> literally how most games went last season 

So we will finish third this season? 
Get your memory checked",Chelsea,Yes,jb00d30,t1_jb006ax
"Last season we finished 3rd and averaged 2 goals a game.

This season we‚Äôve averaged less than 1 and are in 10th place.

We were never this bad under Tuchel last season, and that‚Äôs baring in mind that we‚Äôve brought in Sterling, Mudryk, Aubameyang, Fofana, Madueke and Felix up front

Hell you could add Enzo to that who is the most creative midfielder we‚Äôve had for years",Chelsea,Yes,jb036x4,t1_jb006ax
"I'd love to see a manager to do any better with CHO, Werner, Havertz, Pulisic, Ziyech, a mentally checked out overweight Lukaku as attacking and Alonso-Azpi as their full back options",Chelsea,Yes,jb06nkh,t1_jb006ax
Tuchel would have tried to go for more yesterday not those substitutions,Chelsea,Yes,jb017lj,t1_jb006ax
"Potter was never an overly offensive coach and that was evident at Brighton. He's more in the mold of someone who likes his team to have a lot of control in possession and generate chances that way - like Sarri, albeit more flexible than him. 

It's part of why Brighton fans are happier with RDZ as he encourages a more direct style of play.",Chelsea,Yes,jazhagu,t1_jazgiyq
"Potter has never been a defensive coach, nor does the goal tally of brighton prove this.

What potter is a coach who likes to make on the go changes (midgame)

Likes dynamic midfielders

Has a very friendly approach to his players, and are known to build a good atmosphere around players.

He also has a very good record of integrating future stars.

Judging de zerbi by his 20 games, is like judging potter by his 20 games at chelsea.",Chelsea,Yes,jazi135,t1_jazgiyq
"Yesterday Arsenal proves it's all a mentality thing. Their team is decent, but on paper ours is better, but their comebacks show grit and desire. They play like a team, a team that needs to win. We are weak as hell.",Chelsea,Yes,jazjr1o,t1_jazjq0v
">He‚Äôs going to start making those. Guaranteed.

I agree, but then I was always saying that about Timo.  IIRC he once had a crossbar hat trick!",Chelsea,Yes,jb00kzp,t1_jazim4d
"Agreed, I see your reason",Chelsea,Yes,jaztu2v,t1_jazrug1
I respectfully disagree. You can find alot of players who do what mount does or even better. You can't find many rb's like reece james,Chelsea,Yes,jaztd3v,t1_jazrug1
"Why?

Going forward I doubt mount starts. And James is among the very very best in his position, if not the best.",Chelsea,Yes,jaztfzq,t1_jazrug1
Reece fitness is a problem but are we fast to forget real madrid hsd genuine interest in him?,Chelsea,Yes,jazwcxd,t1_jazrug1
"One is a elite, world class in a hard to find position (but injury prone)

One is a great player but with no real elite traits, in an easy position to fill",Chelsea,Yes,jb0eier,t1_jazrug1
I can see the logic behind that take tbh.,Chelsea,Yes,jazsa10,t1_jazrug1
Definitely an unpopular opinion and one I don‚Äôt agree with. There‚Äôs a reason the likes of Real Madrid we‚Äôre sniffing around for Reece. He has the potential to be the best RB in the world. It was necessary to lock him up early.,Chelsea,Yes,jb261mz,t1_jazrug1
"I'd just love to see him get a run of games behind an actual striker.  He has shown the flashes of how good he truly can be, and I don't believe we've ever given him any significant run in his best position...which he unfortunately now shares with F√©lix and Nkunku.",Chelsea,Yes,jazybja,t1_jazxz4r
"Havertz on the right in a 3-4-2-1 could work really well however, he'd act like a false 9 which is his role",Chelsea,Yes,jb053g9,t1_jazxz4r
"Stop your bitching . Jesus Christ, how embarrassing.",Chelsea,Yes,jazi90a,t1_jazi0vr
"Havertz is a bit unlucky I think because of how the game has evolved, particularly in our league. Tall lanky lads are thought of as out-and-out strikers, and shorter lads who can make chances in the forward area by moving in between the lines are thought of as 10s. Havertz is neither of those.

He‚Äôs more like a playmaker that helps generate chances not by making Fabregas-style passes but by manipulating spaces to his benefit and creating avenues for other players to exploit.",Chelsea,Yes,jazfjmp,t1_jazebra
"He did, he press and work his ass  (same cant be said for either joao or sterling)

But he clearly aint a finisher, and his confidence is 0.

Lukaku would be more useful here... and that is sad",Chelsea,Yes,jazfd0l,t1_jazebra
"Yes it does.

different performances on different days doesn't change that.

Liverpool were there to be absolutely smashed for 5 or 6 when we played them. They were horrific.

If we played them today we'd be in the same position as United now",Chelsea,Yes,jb1ckf3,t1_jb1c9wa
Seen that. It sure is a little tease or the admin is playing with us,Chelsea,Yes,jb0fll8,t1_jb0biog
No,Chelsea,Yes,jb12g36,t1_jb1181w
No,Chelsea,Yes,jb127ij,t1_jb1181w
"1. Keep kepa, Mendy has a purple patch and fell off hard, he also is very bad with his feet and and that single handedly knocked us out of CL vs Madrid last year

2.  Absolutely don‚Äôt sell Chillwell, he‚Äôs a warrior and a key player when fit. He also won the CL with us. Having winners of big trophies on the team helps build a winning culture for new players

3.  Don‚Äôt renew Zak unless fee is 35m or less and he performs at high level for remainder of season

4 sell chalobah, keep colwill

5 Kovacic gets a new contract

6 santos too early to tell. Needs to be assessed in preseason

7 keep mount sell Conor, easy choice

8 yes sell Kai, don‚Äôt buy striker next season unless quality player for decent fee is available. Make do with Lukaku broja and ddf 

9 if forced to loan a player, it‚Äôs ddf, not broja. Broja is ready to play if he recovers",Chelsea,Yes,jb245zi,t1_jb19nxx
"Number one would be Kepa for me. Mendy never got his head right after AFCON and his contract is winding down on a stalemate from what I remember. 

I‚Äôd keep all 3 left backs. Chilwell is great but past two seasons has had a lot of injuries, Maatsen should get minutes and Cucurella can play in a back3 if it‚Äôs needed.

Send Zakaria back, need a clean slate to think through the midfield

Sell Chalobah. Need to balance the books and colwill has a much higher ceiling and I‚Äôd rather give him time in the squad.

For Kova, depends on who we bring in. I‚Äôd be ok with selling him though, injures pretty often but he did have a great game captaining the team yesterday. Really took the game in the first half.

Santos has been great in international but I think he would do well with a loan in the prem. I‚Äôd be surprised if he makes the jump to our midfield unless we get Europa conference or Europa league so he can get the game time.

Keep mount 100%. Playing him so much the past 3 years, he was bound to have a down year. I‚Äôd be he‚Äôll find his form again soon.

Sell Havertz for Ivan Toney or Vlahovic if we can pry him out of Juve. I doubt we‚Äôd keep F√©lix without Europe 

Loan D. Fofana, I think people forget he came straight from the Scandinavian league. And Broja is injured until august, we‚Äôd need to manage his minutes. Doubt clubs would want an injured striker on loan",Chelsea,Yes,jb1gmez,t1_jb19nxx
"I'd sell both Mendy and Kepa.

Neither will ever start for a title challenging team",Chelsea,Yes,jb19w4t,t1_jb19nxx
He has a good thing going on with Roma. I wouldn't mind Simeone or Carlo.,Chelsea,Yes,jb28uya,t1_jb1iw1r
He still has the ultra defensive mindset. Dont follow serie a that much but his team has conceded 10 less as well as scored 10 less than anyone in the top 6.,Chelsea,Yes,jb274xo,t1_jb1iw1r
"I wanted us to win, but for those fans it wasn‚Äôt about vindication.

It‚Äôs incredibly clear that Potter is not the man for the job, and a lot on here feel the sooner he goes the better.

If one loss meant he was gone, that was worth it for a lot of people. 

Look at what happened with United. Ole obviously wasn‚Äôt the man to take them forward long term, and this was obvious for a long time. Every time the sacking rumours were at the highest United would get a big win before reverting to form. 

The improvement under Ten Haag has shown what a competent manager can do",Chelsea,Yes,jb00ead,t1_jazyx9v
"Loser mentality u have, winning against shit relegated almost side like Leeds means nothing

Wait for Dortmund",Chelsea,Yes,jb0v79t,t1_jazyx9v
"Oh fuck off. I wanted us to win but there's no denying it wasn't a performance that shows Potter's on the right track. Apart from sending diagonals to Chilly, we still looked pretty clueless in respect of an overall idea and structure against a team struggling to survive.",Chelsea,Yes,jazzcpr,t1_jazyx9v
"It's the exact opposite if you think about it. Plastic fans want instant gratification-win now, real fans want what is best for the club-sack Potter.",Chelsea,Yes,jazzail,t1_jazyx9v
"We took 3 losses in a row before yesterday's game. If it was certain that potter would be sacked after a loss yesterday, i would've endured another loss for him to fuck off. But we all know the owners will stick with him even if he relegates this team, so i'm just watching these league friendlies carefree",Chelsea,Yes,jb00rdl,t1_jazyx9v
"What a childish comment 

I wanted us to win but I can understand why people perhaps wanted potter to lose so we get in a new manager and can stop being a laughing stock 

Stop thinking so short term.",Chelsea,Yes,jazz596,t1_jazyx9v
What a shit take. It‚Äôs fine for a person to think that a loss tomorrow would be better in the long run if it meant Potter gets sacked just like it‚Äôs fine for a person to want to back potter. This shit ‚Äúplastic‚Äù hunt the subs been on has been so fucking backwards.,Chelsea,Yes,jb066sk,t1_jazyx9v
"What an idiotic comment. Where did you get the notion that we'd be ""vindicated"" after a Chelsea loss from?",Chelsea,Yes,jb035uq,t1_jazyx9v

We‚Äôre 10th and United is 3rd,Chelsea,Yes,jb1uztr,t1_jb1ibx2
"Let's not pretend Pulisic has been better for us than Havertz.

Havertz has scored the winning goal in multiple finals.

I don't think he's great and wouldn't mind him moving on but he's been far better than Pulisic who's been a crappy bench warmer at both his clubs in 2 different leagues.

If both move in the summer I know which one will attract the bigger clubs and the bigger fees.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0wdd2,t1_jb0sp33

"It's not about whether or not he's worth 200k a week, no one is. It's about whether or not he fits into the 200k per week category of OUR wage budget set out by OUR owners. 


Is Sterling worth 375k a week? Koulibaly 325k? Reece James 250k? Is Azpi worth 180k? Cucurella 175k? Auba 160k? 



I don't know where you're getting the 200k figure for from Mount, but if our owners, within the past year have decided that Koulibaly and Sterling can be on those wages and Cucurella can be on just under it, then does Mount fit into that wage structure at around 200k? Almost definitely. Is he worth that? No, but no one is.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0s6o9,t1_jb0j4in
"Very average as an 8.

"No

Saka is a much better player and on 200k a week. Mount will be unlikely to start regularly next season; 200k for a bench player is crazy

A narrow 1-0 against Leeds and parking the bus for the last 30min wont convince me of Potter,Chelsea,Yes,jb1adcw,t1_jb19cqh
"Lol, the fact we had to park bus against Leeds to force a 1-0 win from a set piece goal has convinced most that Potter aint it at all",Chelsea,Yes,jb1blzp,t1_jb19cqh
"Sorry I don‚Äôt see that happening at all. I‚Äôm not saying Potter would fail. But from what I saw so far, Potter severely lacks of in game tactics flexibility to turn the game and lacks of the inspiration needed to be among the best manager. I don't how how he will improve from here nor how his era at Chelsea will turn out. But he is surely not among the top3-5 manager for sure.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1a3vx,t1_jb19cqh
"He‚Äôd fit in perfectly. Liverpool play a 3 in midfield, and mainly their job is to hustle for the ball and press. Perfect for Mount.",Chelsea,Yes,jb01rii,t1_jazvjoe
"Not really. He'd fit them perfectly. He'd be more like wijnaldum for them.good at pressing and moving people around. Can get goals and assists in midfield.

But he's got a lot of energy and that's something Liverpool have missed since he left and Henderson started getting older and missing games.

He's probably trying to implement that philosophy of Liverpool 2017-2020 again. Would be a big mistake to sell him to Liverpool.",Chelsea,Yes,jazzxxz,t1_jazvjoe

"I would rather go with the same midfield duo because they're both extremely comfortable at progressing the ball and we're chasing the tie.

"They‚Äôre completely different players. Felix has shown how talented he is, especially when given the freedom as a 10. 

Mount is an 8, and will do very well if he goes to Liverpool, who under Klopp, actually play with 8s. 

I‚Äôm torn. Felix looks insane in blue. I don‚Äôt want to see Mount in red either, but if he‚Äôs going to walk for free after next season, it makes so much more sense to sell him. 

I wonder if athletico would do a swap? I‚Äôm sure they value Felix much higher than Mount, which is ironic as he would fit their mould much better than Felix does.",Chelsea,Yes,jb08mkk,t1_jb05pfi

Gakpo came in and has been molded into a very different role than he ever did (Firmino's role).

For players that just came in with no service from our midfield, they performed quite well but you know the Internet.

"Because it doesn't tell the full picture. It's an extremely reductive tool when measuring a single attacking performance. A team can finish a game with 0.0xG, but during that game they could've gotten in behind 100 times and misplaced every simple pass for a tap-in.

??  It's currently 5-2 Madrid .If Liverpool want to go through they need a minimum 4 goals to achieve that and for Madrid not to score.,Chelsea,Yes,jb1uv5q,t1_jb1tvv8
Back then we would score.,Chelsea,Yes,jb2t15w,t1_jb1wcqd
"If you referring to the two losses to Liverpool last season, those are just two of 10 unsuccessful domestic cup runs over the past 5 seasons. And even then you can actually argue that it affected us since Chilwell literally suffered a season ending injury against Juve. Even this season, we lost both wingbacks to injuries against Milan that hurt us massively pre WC.",Chelsea,Yes,jb34lme,t1_jb33ww1
The way Felix has been talking it's like he's already signed permanently.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0v6sj,t1_jb0e39m
Felix is more talented than Mount on a technical basis but Mount (besides his poor run now) is a more complete and functional player. If you lose a functional player like him then you should replace him with another functional player (Nkunku),Chelsea,Yes,jb06oxy,t1_jb05zrr
"There‚Äôs no guarantee that Nkunku hire the ground running like Felix has. As long as the asking price isn‚Äôt insane, buying Felix makes sense.",Chelsea,Yes,jb08p0w,t1_jb05zrr
"Does Felix look insane? He looked very good in the first few games, but I don‚Äôt think he has shown much at all in the last few games.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0cflb,t1_jb08mkk
It's crazy how quick people are to judge.,Chelsea,Yes,jb5apot,t1_jb3ft6b
Indeed,Chelsea,Yes,jazq05z,t1_jazpk1b
"I'm not trying to convince you, I'm agreeing with you haha",Chelsea,Yes,jazn2qa,t1_jazk8cc
"He's beyond frustrating this season, but that maybe down to how much he has played. Psychological aspect.",Chelsea,Yes,jazvgw9,t1_jazujp4
"Nunez can score 1 goal but miss 10 other sitters in a game, the amount of chances you guys create for everybody is unbelievable. If he came to a team like Chelsea where we create practically nothing (you're commenting in a Chelsea sub) he'd crumble because he's far from clinical and needs a lot of chances to really get going.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1saj3,t1_jb1rg27
"Tbf most people aren‚Äôt saying he isn‚Äôt good enough

But the contract situation has forced us to make a decision.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0tz11,t1_jb0qt65
"Nah bro we are ""progressing"" after shithousing a 1-0 win vs a relegation-bound side from a set piece, didnt you hear?",Chelsea,Yes,jb2svde,t1_jb2lzl8
Who's the option?,Chelsea,Yes,jazzert,t1_jazv8aj
Auba and fofana aint in the cl squad,Chelsea,Yes,jb0edpf,t1_jazv8aj
The current squad issues existed under Tuchel. Did you not watch us play football for the last 12 months. It‚Äôs the same issue for both. Not defending Potter but the issues that exist now started halfway through last season and have only been exacerbated further by Potter.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0scyl,t1_jazpulr
Don‚Äôt bother with the downvotes mate. Bunch of fragile little man children upset that they didn‚Äôt get their wish last night of coming here to Karma farm with Potter hate. People don‚Äôt understand that you can support the team while not being convinced by Potter.,Chelsea,Yes,jazmg4d,t1_jazlfxs
"Yeah I know he is that roamer, but does he actually create much at the end of it all, I'm not seeing it. Again though he's technically wonderful on the ball, but for Chelsea right now he's a luxury player who won't provide the end product for a team that desperately needs it. Ironically, who we desperately need is another Bruno Fernandes who may frustrate but he's all about the end product. I think maybe that's who it could be but isn't he better out wide? Admittedly I haven't seen too much of Nkunku live but what I have seen he was good drifting out left. 

I'm just extremely wary of blowing our money on Felix, we simply cannot get these next moves wrong in this squad or good luck to us for the next year's when we cannot sustain this heavy spending every season..All I want is someone like Vlahovic or Osimhen up front who can finish.",Chelsea,Yes,jaztgtp,t1_jazt1te
Nkunku has never played in the league and seems to have injury problems.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0ojpb,t1_jb02r6h
No - i just want the best for the team regardless of ethnicity or passport,Chelsea,Yes,jb426p2,t1_jb0dxxn
If you don't like the russian kid then let's use carney as a backup to nkunku at cam. Do you honestly think mount will accept being a bench player?,Chelsea,Yes,jazsuzr,t1_jazslun
So you think mount would accept being a bench player because once nkunku comes in he is not going to be a guaranteed starter,Chelsea,Yes,jb0gizn,t1_jazx7yd
"Mount even when played in deeper, pushes so high up he‚Äôs an attacking mid and neglects his midfield duties",Chelsea,Yes,jazt31k,t1_jazs4te
Mount has never been an 8,Chelsea,Yes,jazs89t,t1_jazs4te
If mount is an 8 why is he higher up the pitch than the striker at times????,Chelsea,Yes,jazsma6,t1_jazs4te
"He also sacked his agent and made his dad his new agent

You don‚Äôt usually sack your agent unless you‚Äôre unhappy with them; often in football it‚Äôs because you want a move away. Never heard of a player switching agents when negotiating a contract 

Also, mount making sure his dad is his agent ensure any agent fees upon a sale goes to his father.",Chelsea,Yes,jazyjyv,t1_jazyg1v
When he goes to Liverpool and is shining there,Chelsea,Yes,jazzzu0,t1_jazyg1v
"He supposedly wants a ""Reece James""-like contract which I assume is slightly less valuable to Kante's. 

No one knows the specifics but should be approx to 250-300k a week. Mount has absolutely no case to demand that high. Surely he knows that himself.",Chelsea,Yes,jb03v29,t1_jb01chw
"We still scored 76 goals last season whilst ‚Äúnot playing great‚Äù. To put that into perspective, we will need to score 4 goals every game for the remaining 13 games to match that :)",Chelsea,Yes,jb03p8u,t1_jb023dg
"I mean I mean last season, mount had 11 goals, havertz n lukaku had 8, pulisic n reece 6, ziyech, timo n cho had a bunch of goals, that accounts for >60% of the goals. Even Arsenal this season has goals across its squad.
We played well yesterday, controlled the game for most parts, but thats just one game. Comparing it to how we played last season is outrageous. Last season, outside of the City games, we were able to control most of the games. If we can do that consistently from now on this season, we can talk.",Chelsea,Yes,jb06ikw,t1_jb023dg
‚ÄúYesterday was literally how most games went last season‚Äù,Chelsea,Yes,jb1ome7,t1_jb0eqk7
"We were always in control and almost always looked unbeatable in the beginning of the last season, nothing like yesterday and calling it grinding out results is quite a stretch, we were top of the league and in an upward trajectory before the injuries/covid. And had the same attackers still, quite an expensive group of players but their performances here under different managers and Tuchel's career and play style overall should point out what was the reason for the underwhelming attacking output, CHO and Werner moved and are not even regular starters for Leverkusen and Leipzig, Lukaku is benched by a 40 year old Dzeko today. Tuchel's nothing like Jose, come on",Chelsea,Yes,jb19s4y,t1_jb0djjn
"It's madness, 3 years, 3 managers, multiple positions, teammates, formations and he's still shit. But wait if we just try this he'll be good I swear.


He's like our Pogba who United fans spent years talking about how to unlock, except worse than Pogba on the pitch and less controversial off it.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0kt6h,t1_jb06f9b
And yet he's always playing even under Tuchel and Flick... They must all see something we don't,Chelsea,Yes,jb07z2a,t1_jb06f9b
"Oh yes there was an error I made in the second paragraph. 

Why do you think I am trying to sound *intellectual*?",Chelsea,Yes,jb0fynp,t1_jb0f66s
You're the kinda guy that would celebrate getting invited to a party.,Chelsea,Yes,jb1ddtu,t1_jb1d5c1
Lmao he threw in Pulisic ü§£,Chelsea,Yes,jb1iwvi,t1_jb1fz2c
"Nice! One thing I‚Äôm really curious about is what we do with Lukaku.. that‚Äôs a big gamble with the board+potter(or whoever) when we start next season if we try to re-integrate him. 

If it were me, I‚Äôd keep him out. First team needs consistency in the direction of squad building, and Lukaku isn‚Äôt that",Chelsea,Yes,jb2pa6v,t1_jb24d5w
If we‚Äôd sustained that pressure we would of played well just like if we‚Äôd tactically outclassed every over team we faced we‚Äôd be winning the league. Bit redundant of u to essentially say ‚Äúif some of Potters biggest shortcomings weren‚Äôt there then he‚Äôd be a good manager‚Äù,Chelsea,Yes,jb06dkz,t1_jb02nz1
yeah fuck me for supporting the team even when we're down. I should be sending death threats to Potter like the REAL supporters are doing.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0wfgc,t1_jb0pocd
"Pulisic at his best was 6 games at the end of the season in the strangest conditions in football has ever seen.

Pulisic has been absolutely dog shit 99% of his entire career at 2 different clubs under half a dozen different managers.

He's just simply not very talented which is why he inevitably gets benched wherever he plays or whoever coaches him 

Per minute stats are irrelevant as Puli being a career long bench warmer often comes on against tired legs when the games are stretched.

Kai is a 23 year old with 75 career goals.
Pulisic having played 12 games less is a 24 year old with 45 career goals

Again I don't rate Kai particularly highly but as a player he's obviously levels above Pulisic and every manager that coaches them both can see that.",Chelsea,Yes,jb10g48,t1_jb0z1m7
Late 2021 when Lukaku got injured he was in good form.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0zdbs,t1_jb0z1m7
"They have given out 8 of our top 10 highest paid contracts...


The other 2 players in the top 10 are Kante and Chilwell",Chelsea,Yes,jb0y0ng,t1_jb0ud9x
Sakas a tremendous player; I did also always say saka was better too,Chelsea,Yes,jb0m9dw,t1_jb0m75y
"Yeah I gathered I'd missed it. Wanted to know where I could find streams for future games, watched him at the u20 Brasil comp and he was great. Want to keep watching him. I'll look ok twitter next time cheers",Chelsea,Yes,jb2lge5,t1_jb2l4fb
"Agreed but the club should have sold or renewed either AC or Rudi. 

Losing both on a free is an unacceptable outcome.",Chelsea,Yes,jb258fs,t1_jb0po0x
It's hardly rewarding mediocrity when he's been so crucial for us in the previous 2 seasons. Spending ¬£100m on Felix + his wages isn't exactly saving any money is it?,Chelsea,Yes,jb0q1ly,t1_jb0pbwt
"Yea, it‚Äôs a useful stat but it‚Äôs annoying when people try act like it‚Äôs to only thing that matters",Chelsea,Yes,jb3trul,t1_jb2p5u1
"He was clear through on goal, took too long barely looked up and decided chipping it was better when he could have took it past the goalie, or hit it low and hard BOTH choices make it much more difficult than trying to chip a goalie when the ball is at exactly the height that favours a keeper. It was no more a 'very difficult save'. I'd love it for him to prove me wrong but he has zero conviction in front of goal, Aubameyang would have scored that.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0i0u5,t1_jb0c00q
Go back further and you'll see I always say he plays better in Europe ! Glad he was immense last night!,Chelsea,Yes,jbdp920,t1_jbcms7f
Kloppo got a plan for us,Chelsea,Yes,jb28aqq,t1_jb27dq6
"What did you make of
RLCs performance yesterday then?",Chelsea,Yes,jb0jwzu,t1_jb0jtv3
I honestly don‚Äôt think so. Dortmund had more possession and marginally less number of attacking attempts. Think we had 18 or 19 and they had 15ish. The team played really well for like 20 minutes and it got pretty even,Chelsea,Yes,jb0k5tu,t1_jb0jorl
Doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative,Chelsea,Yes,jb0k94k,t1_jb0jorl
Like yeah we've done terrorist ball at times but majority of the time we don't do it,Chelsea,Yes,jb24xv4,t1_jb1hr6t
Okay good to know,Chelsea,Yes,jb1fi48,t1_jb1feni
Who doesn‚Äôt enjoy seeing Man Utd get hammered ?,Chelsea,Yes,jb1gq7l,t1_jb1fbjb
"Some of you need to go outside and understand that football isn‚Äôt all about your team, is it a crime to enjoy a good game of football when your team is struggling.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1hez4,t1_jb1fbjb
\+3 GD before regulation gets them to extra time. Then possibly penalties. But I guess the comment on away goals was off because it would potentially have helped them. Just meant that 4-1 or 3-0 is a possible path.,Chelsea,Yes,jb1wfg9,t1_jb1uv5q
Score but very rare to go 6-0 up against Southampton then batter Madrid because we didn‚Äôt have recognized scorers still,Chelsea,Yes,jb4369x,t1_jb2t15w
"Felix is definitely a luxury player atm.

Doesn't provide goals or assists and at the same time is not as good defensively as mount.

Gonna be KDB situation all over again.",Chelsea,Yes,jb06t6h,t1_jb06oxy
"The fact is, there‚Äôs no chance we‚Äôd get Felix for below 100mil- it was the asking price in December and that was before he was on a ridiculous contract. There‚Äôs no guarantee about Nkunku but there are never guarantees about players so having the alternative of spending 100 mil for a position that doesn‚Äôt need reinforcing whilst we have little money and other positions that we‚Äôre light in doesn‚Äôt make sense.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0cxd6,t1_jb08p0w
If that is ‚ÄúInsane‚Äù the standards are as low as they have ever been.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0gf7r,t1_jb0cflb
"Not insane, but our most creative player by a distance.  Also, had he not hit the bar twice recently (I know.. I know.. ), he would also have been our most productive by far.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0ls47,t1_jb0cflb
"We now have 3 wins in 17 (?) PL games. All the suffering was worth it.

Suck on that, plastics!",Chelsea,Yes,jb2xz1s,t1_jb2svde
"DDF

He can't do worse than Havertz, he actually had positive cameos in the limited minutes he received, and currently Potter does not even put him on the bench over useless Aubameyang.",Chelsea,Yes,jazziwc,t1_jazzert
"Give Auba another chance, his work rate might be shit (always has been, everywhere he‚Äôs been) but give him a chance to finish and he‚Äôll take it, especially now that we‚Äôve started creating chances again.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0a5md,t1_jazzert
"Havertz mount Gallagher will all fetch 100m minimum combined

Felix can be easily funded and is better than all 3 of them easily",Chelsea,Yes,jaztkdo,t1_jaztgtp
"Nkunku being injury Prone is a myth. Before the wc injury , he has missed less than 15 games in his Leipzig career",Chelsea,Yes,jb188wu,t1_jb0ojpb
Carney needs a loan. Possibly two.,Chelsea,Yes,jazzvyx,t1_jazsuzr
Do you think Felix would?,Chelsea,Yes,jb0hec6,t1_jb0gizn
"Precisely.

We lose control of games now but before we'd always have a grip of the game but cannot create enough chances",Chelsea,Yes,jb06z4z,t1_jb06ikw
"I don‚Äôt remember us always being in control. A lot of games were ass clenching towards the end of them. League position is irrelevant when it comes to performances, you can win the same amount of games playing nice football or shit football, it‚Äôs the same end result.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1bdvc,t1_jb19s4y
"He‚Äôs played under every manager lol, yet people here think better. I will say I‚Äôd prefer a CF to play in front of him and Felix, but I don‚Äôt want him off the team.",Chelsea,Yes,jb09fmp,t1_jb07z2a
Because he does other things really well like pressing which managers like and it's not like those 2 had a wealth of options. From a purely attacking pov he's just not the guy which is a shame. He just ain't a natural goalscorer and he's not much of a creator either.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0dn2c,t1_jb07z2a
Remind me how Germany have done in their last two tournaments?,Chelsea,Yes,jb0l2tm,t1_jb07z2a
Someone‚Äôs had a bad day hahahaha. Lighten up you miserable cunt.,Chelsea,Yes,jb1dn4h,t1_jb1ddtu
"The Lukaku situation is tricky. He won‚Äôt be sold because nobody will want his wages unless we subsidize them. May be worth to take it as a sink cost and just take the L on the transfer fee and subsidized wages for the rest of his contract. 

I‚Äôm also open to keeping him, but that will largely depend on preseason I think. If potter is going to primarily use a possession based system, I don‚Äôt think it makes since because Lukaku thrives in space and counterattacks. That was the failure of Tuchel with Lukaku. His system flashed with lukakus strengths.",Chelsea,Yes,jb2qmfr,t1_jb2pa6v
"That‚Äôs just false and shows your insane bias. Pulisic has THE best g+a/90 of all the attackers since he‚Äôs been here. He‚Äôs also at .75 g+a/90 in the UCL since being here. That is not a bad player, and to say that it is shows you aren‚Äôt logical. 

Pulisic was literally a starter for us before getting injured, and the fact that we have scored 4 goals in 11 matches since he‚Äôs been out (2 by defenders mind you) kinda points to the fact that he is actually one of our better attackers. 

The metrics literally prove you to be wrong.",Chelsea,Yes,jb118et,t1_jb10g48
"He was. You are correct. It was actually early 2022, but he did have a solid stretch.",Chelsea,Yes,jb11gq5,t1_jb0zdbs
Compare it to our January signings. Where we finally had a respectable backroom team,Chelsea,Yes,jb0y2h7,t1_jb0y0ng
What's mount done this season and this season only to deserve 200+k a week?. If we are rewarding players that big of contract for having a good season a year or two ago then let's give mendy 200+k a week no? After all mendy was one of the best goalkeepers in the world a season and two ago. Just using your logic mateüôÉ,Chelsea,Yes,jb0r67d,t1_jb0q1ly
"Another reason why xG is useless at times: Against Utd, Liverpool broke the PL record (since Opta began) for entries into an opposition box with 77  entries. Liverpool were a hot knife and Utd's defence was butter.

But apparently they only deserved 2/3 goals.",Chelsea,Yes,jb51jcp,t1_jb3trul
"He looked really good, probably his best performance since the spurs game in August. I think right now wingback suits him a bit better than in the midfield. He can use the touch line to his advantage and is less likely to get caught taking too many touches. Also keeps him out wide where he can cross the ball in or play one-twos to get others into the box.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0kczc,t1_jb0jwzu
"Dortmund having more possession was clearly part of Chelsea‚Äôs tactics. It was a clear departure from how Chelsea usually play to limit Dortmund‚Äôs ability to break which is how they get most of their goals. Chelsea controlled the game well in the Dortmund half, exemplified by them having less attacking chances while having more possession‚Ä¶",Chelsea,Yes,jb0l0wn,t1_jb0k5tu
"In the 2nd half we had them penned in pretty well 

Most of their
Xg came from that one adeyemi goal 

We racked up over 2xg and couldn‚Äôt convert 

I thought we adjusted well in the 2nd half",Chelsea,Yes,jb0ktny,t1_jb0k5tu
"I'd rather they beat Liverpool.  I despise the murders.

Either way I don't particularly care about the results of much better teams when our rivals are currently Crystal Palace and Aston Villa.

I'm not going to banter a club that is currently miles ahead of us by every possible metric.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1gz95,t1_jb1gq7l
"""Good game of football"" ""7-0 result"" 

Pick one.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1ho7f,t1_jb1hez4
"I notice how Felix loses a lot of time on the ball when he should be doing things a lot quicker, those milliseconds make a massive difference in terms of being able to create higher-quality chances. You don't see Odegaard take an extra touch for example",Chelsea,Yes,jb07lp3,t1_jb06t6h
DDF is having his first full season as a pro coming from the Norwegian league... He's not ready to be a starter in the EPL for Chelsea,Chelsea,Yes,jb05cxo,t1_jazziwc
I'm talking about CL,Chelsea,Yes,jb0062f,t1_jazziwc
He isn‚Äôt in the CL squad,Chelsea,Yes,jb0aue6,t1_jb0a5md
Bullshit. Felix ain't even better than Havertz. Put havertz in that no 10 position and he'll do better than Felix. Felix will be the most pointless signing ever and will take years to rectify our mistake,Chelsea,Yes,jb02lbc,t1_jaztkdo
"We should get more than that.

But the overhang is if Potter is sacked and the next manager prefer resources like Mount than flair players",Chelsea,Yes,jaztyb8,t1_jaztkdo
"Yeah Mount could go for 50-60, even with a year left, I don't want it but if it happens it is what it is, he had the power to extend if he truly wishes to.
Maybe Felix improves with better players around him, that could be very likely, but if it happens I hope its for way less than 100m. I still cling to hope that we can somehow include Luakku into the deal, I feel like he actually suits Atletico perfectly and he hasn't been to La Liga yet.",Chelsea,Yes,jazu1mc,t1_jaztkdo
He's been injured a lot this year and has never played in the league.   No way should we count on his success.,Chelsea,Yes,jb19zeu,t1_jb188wu
I'm not advocating for us to buy felix. I would love mount to stay but realistically this guy is not accepting being a bench player to nkunku,Chelsea,Yes,jb0iib0,t1_jb0hec6
"Yeah. Last season, we had too many individual errors. We always managed to blow up our lead somehow.  We were far more efficient in front of the goal. So, the one or two clear cut chances we got every game were usually enough. (cue the Wolves game 2-2). 

This season, somehow our midfield is wide open, our press from the front three is shit. Our attackers are so low in confidence, it's hard to watch them take shots. We played well yesterday, but on another day, against even slightly better opposition, it won't be enough. With whatever time Potter has earned from yesterday, he has to fix these issues.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0bvsp,t1_jb06z4z
Their defense is made of Swiss cheese. They score goals.,Chelsea,Yes,jb0w2nb,t1_jb0l2tm
"Todays been pretty good.

Just sad to see a loser like you on every post trying to pretend our poor results weren't so poor under Graham while often pretending things were much worse before he came in.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1dsz4,t1_jb1dn4h
"Lmao.

Americans and trying to pretend per 90 stats matter for bench warmers name a better duo

Your 2nd paragraph is actually hilarious when you consider Pulisic has 1 goal in 21 games this season and We've literally been bringing in multiple wingers this season so we don't have to even have Pulisic on the bench.",Chelsea,Yes,jb11o01,t1_jb118et
Mendy isn't coveted by the top clubs in England lmao these two scenarios are not the same üòÇ Please use a bit of common sense before making ridiculous comparisons like that,Chelsea,Yes,jb0sduw,t1_jb0r67d
"I don't think that's much of a high bar.

We all love Ruben, but I didn't feel he was much threat really going forward yesterday. All our opportunities yesterday really came down the other flank.  If we're now going to play 3 at the back with an injury-prone James, I guess RLC will get game time.. but I'm not excited about it.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0lkf8,t1_jb0kczc

"He‚Äôs played, 3 games in blue? I think he‚Äôs done pretty well, and will only get better with time.",Chelsea,Yes,jb08rfo,t1_jb07lp3
"We have him one chance as a starter and he did well there. Like I said, he literally can't do worse than Havertz, while there is a chance he might do better.

All it takes is just a bit of more balls from Potter to drop a player who is not performing.",Chelsea,Yes,jb06202,t1_jb05cxo
What do you see in Havertz that makes you defend him so much? Is you neck on the line?,Chelsea,Yes,jb0erdd,t1_jb05cxo

"No manager should prefer mount to felix in the cam spot. It‚Äôs absolute nonsense if you do

"Yeah we can‚Äôt let mount go for free is the main thing

Felix won‚Äôt be 100m; I‚Äôve seen reports of around 70 to 80m.",Chelsea,Yes,jazu3wm,t1_jazu1mc
"Sorry I was speaking to someone else as well today about Mount/ Felix, I thought u were them. Realistically, I would definitely say Mount would be fine. The biggest strength he has as a player is his versatility so even though he would be out of our strongest starting XI, he could still easily make it as an AM, an 8 or a LW/LM. Nkunku is a bit injury prone as is so having Mount as back up would be quality.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0jj7n,t1_jb0iib0
"Do you know the meaning of a joke? It‚Äôs football ffs, it‚Äôs not that deep.",Chelsea,Yes,jb1e28w,t1_jb1dsz4
"67% of his goal contributions have come as a starter. Bench warmer numbers? Yet again, the stats show you are wrong. It‚Äôs fun arguing with idiots who just think saying things without backing actually matter. You sound dumb. 

Pulisic has played 600 minutes in those 21 games, while Havertz has played 1800 minutes in his 24 games. It‚Äôs almost like that‚Äôs not an even slate huh? And guess what, in Havertz 3x playing time, he has‚Ä¶ wait for it‚Ä¶ 3x the number of goal contributions. Even with playing consistent minutes, and actually playing at the head of the attack for significant minutes, havertz has done crap with the time he has played. 

For once it would be nice to have legitimate debate, but you can‚Äôt really offer that. Have a great day knowing that Havertz has scored 1 goal in his last 11 starts. Great player",Chelsea,Yes,jb13oi2,t1_jb11o01
It's your logic tho. Mendy was crucial for us last season and the season before that. Why shouldn't he get 200k a week now just like you are saying mount should?,Chelsea,Yes,jb0t894,t1_jb0sduw
">	All our opportunities yesterday really came down the other flank. 

This was on purpose mate. They overloaded the right side to draw Ayling inside and created acres for Chilwell.",Chelsea,Yes,jb0n0h8,t1_jb0lkf8
"That's true, I guess we can see at the end of the season if he should be a good buy",Chelsea,Yes,jb09rvq,t1_jb08rfo

That's alright. But what if the manager doesn't play a role which has CAM? Something like what Tuchel did where pressing is more important and progressive carries are prioritised,Chelsea,Yes,jazu6cn,t1_jazu11y
"Felix is my favorite player on our team ATM, but I think he has another weakness.  He seems to fall off midway through the second half.  I think Potter was right to sub him off when he did.

"No, he can't do worse than Havertz because Kai is already playing at absolutely dire level.

You need to send clear signal to player that if they don't perform, manager won't hesitate to replace them with youth.

And he‚Äôs clearly had bench warmer minutes this year. I‚Äôm not dumb. He‚Äôs also been out injured the last 11 games, which I don‚Äôt know, may have something to do with his limited minutes. I‚Äôm talking about over his entire Chelsea career. But clearly you are incapable of critical thinking.",Chelsea,Yes,jb16l3i,t1_jb16000
"It was on purpose to the extent that exposing Ayling was an obvious tactic. And using Ruben as a ball carrier and his passing in tight spaces to draw Leeds to the right was important to creating the space.

Wouldn't this be a good idea to implement again? I feel like one of our problems is that Chelsea is being too reliant on advancing the ball through the wings and not enough through the center.

Just play with the thought, if we had Ten Hag, do you think he could achieve anything? How could anyone coach a team with the owners constantly up in their ass questioning everything? This whole situation is a disaster.

Like what happened to Brighton after we stole their coaching stuff? They got even better. So what's up with that? It just means Brighton's success was not the result of Graham Potter's masterclass, like for example River Plate's success can be attributed to Gallardo. It means Brighton is doing well because their owner and directors are all doing a very good job, and as a result the team is doing a very good job.

That picture of Boehly and Potter walking together at Cobham is actually making me sick. Do you know who deserved that kind of support? Tuchel. Not backing him and now refusing to sack Potter is madness. An owner behaving like that does have an impact on the team and clearly shows. Even on the manager.

"Momentum, squad harmony, personal relationships within the squad, how comfortable the players feel are at least as important as the sheer player quality. The board completely fucked that by bringing a dozen mostly inexperienced new players and bloating the squad over 30 players and putting someone who doesn't seem to equipped to deal with it or able to say it's a bad idea in charge, in Potter's defense most managers couldn't deal with that but he should have prevented it from happening but that would probably cause him to share the same fate with Tuchel eventually

Half the starting line up change between some games, some players start a game but can't even find a place on the bench in the next one, probably except for Reece and Silva every player in the squad either just joined or their future beyond this summer is uncertain, and even more shockingly there are players who fall into both categories, and Potter clearly lost on how to handle that, that's not a team just a random group of footballers so we see that disjointed mess on the pitch.

Klopp has, Mourinho has at both Spurs and Inter, Pep said it when Sterling and Gabriel Jesus were allowed to leave.

"Clearly there is a mentality problem with our players, especially the attackers. Since Hazard, none of our attackers except maybe Willian have been reliable for an entire season. The problem has to be deeper than the manager just being shit. Attackers under Lamps (2nd season especially) were shit, under TT they were shit, and under Potter they are shit. Hell even under Sarri our attack was pass to Hazard and inshallah. 


Imo this lack of attacking quality started glaring sometime during Lampard's second season which caused him to fuck up the team defensively to compensate for the shit attacking, especially against teams that park the bus so they can counter.


Then Tuchel came and as good as we were under him, we were always more reliant on our defensive solidity then pushing from there. But our attack never got quite going no matter who we had either players wise or manager wise. When our defense got shit after Rudi left especially, TT was sacked. 


The attacking problem imo is deeper than it being the managers fault, because TT failed, Lamps failed and Potter is failing. Not to mention Sarri too, but he was bailed by Hazard.",Chelsea,Yes,jarfpw6,t1_jarbt9k
"If he really is a good coach he should stick to his philosophy. I think ""hail marys"" are done by inexperienced and desperate coaches. Look at Klopp for example - he almost never changes the way pool play and he always manages to turn their form around.

Potter is bound to win a game (surely, right?) and then try to get a second win and hope the players are actually on board and start trusting him more. I know one thing though, if I was Potter, I wouldn't be giving the players so many days off - there needs to be some discipline in this team.",Chelsea,Yes,jareke6,t1_jarbt9k
"I feel like he has already rotated and switched out people enough. If I was him, I would have an honest discussion with the players, see what their expectations are, let them know the situation that we are in, etc. I would not play Kai up top anymore, he is not a striker, and it is obvious every single match he plays. This also means that I would include Aubamayang in the starting line up. I would not play Ziyech as a starter, as he is just not cutting it, so I would move either Mudryk or Sterling out to the right (Sterling and Mudryk starting is the way forward for me), and have Felix playing as CAM.   


Aubamayang  
Mudryk - Felix - Sterling  
Enzo - (Kova/Kante/RLC)  
  Chillwell - KK - Fofana - Azpi

I trust these players to perform. Sub on Mudryk, Madueke for explosiveness. Give Davido Fofana a chance. Players to rotate with Wesley Fofana, Chilwell, Badishile, Hall, Kovacic, Zakaria, RLC, Chukwuemenka, Ziyech.

&#x200B;

Get rid and don't waste time giving chances to:

&#x200B;

Chalobah (can't defend 1vs1), Azpi (finished), Gallagher (good shot + tenacity, but that's all he's shown), Havertz (jack of no traits, pressing and heading merchant, offers nothing to the game), Pulisic (lost his explosiveness and pace).

A lot of work to do but pretty straight forward decisions. 

Add: Gusto, Nkunku, Colwill, #6, #8 potentially, #9",Chelsea,Yes,jarajme,t1_jar5d4o
"I‚Äôll take a swing. 
1st- I would let Bettinelli‚Äôs contract expire, extend Kante, let Felix‚Äôs loan expire, and make Zakaria permanent.

2nd- I would sell Chalobah(20), Gallagher(35), RLC(10), Ziyech(20), Pulisic(35), Aubamayang(8)
And possibly sell Mendy, Azpi, Koulibaly, Cucurella, and Kovacic dependent on fee, contract talks, and interest in staying.

3rd- Bring Nkunku, Gusto, Colwill(loan), and Maatsen(loan) in to the squad and loan out Hall, Chukwuemeka, Hutchinson, Fofana, and some of the reserve players possibly. And possibly bring in a GK, CDM, and ST dependant on sales with Kobel, Ugarte, and Oshimen being the top targets. 

That would leave the squad as follows:

Gk: Kepa, Slonina, Mendy?, and a potential buy

Lb: Chilwell, Maatsen, Cucurella?

Rb: Reece, Gusto, Azpi?

Cb: Silva, Benoit, Fofana, Colwill, Koulibaly?

Cdm/Cm: Enzo, Kante, Zakaria, Kovacic?, and a potential buy

Cam: Nkunku, Mount

Lw: Mudryk, Sterling

Rw: Madueke

St: Havertz, Broja, and a potential buy.

"Ziyech, Pulisic, Bettinelli and Chalobah out. I don't want Pulisic out because he is genuinely so direct and our best goalscorer from the wings but he simply isn't a starter for most managers and he seems to not like when he doesn't start plus injured a lot.",Chelsea,Yes,jar8u9u,t1_jar5d4o
"Felix and Zakaria are as of now not set to be part of our squad. Surely Ziyech and Auba find homes after we tried to sell them this window, and they are not really featuring. Have to think we aren't carrying that many keepers next year. I assume Slonina goes out on loan, we sell Mendy or perhaps both. That's 5-6 that I think are almost certain.

In the probably section I would assume Pulisic is gone. Hall and Hutchinson probably aren't featuring regularly. Either on loan or playing limited minutes. Broja will be out for the start of the season right? And then I would guess we lose at least one of Kova, Mount, Gallagher, or Chuk through sale or loan. Possibly 2. That's another 4-6 I think and gets us down to a pretty manageable number.

">Half the starting line up change between some games, some players start a game but can't even find a place on the bench in the next one,

There's a lot to rightly criticize Potter for, but I just don't agree with this over-rotation argument. I've followed his reasoning for squad decisions closely all season and I'm very sure that about 80-90% of his rotation is directly or indirectly caused by injuries, illnesses and other such issues. We have simply had an unprecedented injury crisis and players are not just fully available or fit just because they're not completely out anymore.

And especially given the absolutely absurd amount of injuries we've had, I fully respect that Potter is prioritizing their fitness over his own future. He could have thrown Reece, Silva, etc. in against Southampton but the medical department flagged injury risks so he didn't involve them. Fair play imo, and there's a good chance we'll be thanking him for his careful management of key players next season - even if he himself won't be here.",Chelsea,Yes,jaqdo13,t1_jaqcnm5

"It's an effect of years of recruitment and squad mismanagement. Look back at the days of yore, when we were top scorers in the league. We had tons of goal scorers across the whole squad. We had the PL's best ever scoring midfielder, center backs with elite scoring records, and at times like 4 established recognized strikers in the squad. Hell, Ancelotti even started 3 strikers at once some games. Our recruitment over the last 10 years or so to rebuild that 1st gen squad has just been really bad, especially at replacing lost goal scorers. When we do sign a striker, it's the wrong fit and we ship off 2-3 other strikers to make room for the big signing. We've more recently tried to be more fashionable and not use bona fide strikers, but we haven't supplemented with actual goal scoring wingers and midfielders. Goal scoring is hard. You need specialists. Lampard did actually try and address it a bit with the profile of players we recruited under him, but neither him nor higher ups in recruitment got the details right.

But it's not really enough of an excuse for Potter. He is still performing far below where this squad should be and below the level managers before him. The question is now, how does he rectify it? Should he change to far more attacking tactics in hope to score goals but potentially concede ugly scorelines?

">How does Datro Fofana start one game for us and look alright

I know the sub was wanking over his two real involvements in the game, but he wasn't good and Potter basically said as much after the game. His positioning was a mess, he wasn't available in our buildup from the back and it showed... or, well, didn't. He also didn't really press or do anything else. Basically, he produced exactly the kind of performance every non-Havertz striker has produced for us in recent years. Gets the ball occasionally, does something that looks exciting, but in reality he was a passenger for most of it and there was zero substance to his game. Instantly improved massively when Havertz came on. 

>What's with switching between Ziyech and Madueke every other week?

Neither has done well enough to nail down the spot + rotation? I reckon it'll be Sterling RW for the most part now, with Mudryk LW. But that's basically the only position he's rotated a bit too much, and it's also the one where (in Sterling's absence) it was the one position where it isn't clear who the starter should be.

>Neither has done well enough to nail down the spot + rotation?

>And so that means he should alternate them then? What good is going to come of that, we'd be better off giving one of them a run of games.

Well, need to consider that Madueke can't play in the CL. So Ziyech in for Dortmund was necessary, but shutting Madueke out completely would be really harsh (especially because Ziyech wasn't even supposed to be here anymore). So I kinda get some of that.

Probably a bad idea by me to muddy the discussion but I always can't help but compare it to Mount who appears to be *hated* at times despite being a key player for us in multiple seasons. Yeah his form has tanked this season for sure, and he should be dropped, but the hate around him goes way further than that and yet a player like Havertz who has objectively been worse over the last 3 years still gets put in so many peoples favoured line ups both now and for next season.

Tough decisions to make.

"Oh. 

That is an interesting one. Never thought about it. 

I think I would be okay with him coming. Think he excels at his organisation, attention to detail, playing style (attacking football), bond with the fans etc. And all those things we're sorely lacking at the moment. Moreover he looks like someone who can build a team which is what we need at the moment. A proper football man, and I think it could work tbh.",Chelsea,Yes,jalw15b,t1_jalv9zl

"We have technically very good forwards though. Technical ability =/= creativity.

The lack of connection is a result of lack of attacking patterns, structure and understanding, and not because of technical ability.

"One of the worst parts of Tuchel's sacking is finding an elite manager is extremely hard, it took 10 years for United. When Abramovich sacked managers there was usually someone potentially worthy of the job lined up, now there is simply no one available who is not underwhelming to me. One hope for me is Nagelsmann becoming available somehow but looks unlikely, wouln't say no to Enrique either but I think he doesn't speak English and will 100% have problems with this ownership",Chelsea,Yes,jamjftg,t1_jamdk9s

"If anything, from a strictly defensive pov Marcos is probably better suited to being a central defender than a fullback/wingback. He's positionally very solid, but lacks the pace you need in the modern game in a wide defensive position. He's excellent in the air.

He probably found his way out wide to get the most out of his undeniable attacking output. Playing fullback/wingback lets him contribute his qualities at both ends of the pitch.",Chelsea,Yes,jaohset,t1_jao9k2o
"Despite the memes and what half of this sub says, he‚Äôs actually pretty good at some aspects of defending. He‚Äôs got limits but he knows how to play to his strengths. Has a good height for it, and is excellent with the ball at his feet too.

"We had Zouma playing in defensive midfield lol. Papyy Djiboldji (I know I got it wrong) was our 4th choice CB. I don't even remember if we had a proper backup to Costa/Fabregas/Matic. Granted the first 11 was much better than the current one, but we haven't had this much quality depth in ages. It was just a freak season and you can't just put the entire blame on Jose as the board definitely tried their best to not improve the squad that summer.

As for your other points, if the problems really are this simple as trimming a bloating squad and continuing to play our 100M worth young players, he's done that already when he came back in 2012-13 (look at the prior results before he arrived and then how we changed), and how well he set that Real Madrid team for the next few seasons or so. 

No manager is perfect and I am not saying Jose should be our #1 choice but he's done this sort of rebuild before. Has the balls to drop and cut loose those not needed and create mentality monsters out of youth.",Chelsea,Yes,jalskcm,t1_jaljd5j
"Good podcast as usual from them. They were both fans of Potter as well when he was appointed so it was funny when Jules ripped into him lol.

Gab made a good point that there is nothing to gain from sacking him until we're close to relegation troubles but again we're only 10 points ahead of an abject Everton side. Any more draws or losses in the next 2 crucial games and he should be sacked imo.",Chelsea,Yes,jalrgut,t1_jall085
"I‚Äôm tired of pretending that if Tuchel were still in charge, we‚Äôd look this bad. To everyone saying we were shit for half a season, please find me one time since Potter has taken over, where we‚Äôve played as good as we did against Madrid at their own park. We beat a Milan team with 10 changes to their first XI in our most emphatic win under Potter. 

Not too mention the reasoning for the slide in the second half is due to much more than just injuries (of which we had a lot of) and more due to the sanctions, unpredictability of the clubs future, players making deals not knowing whether CFC would even be in the league the following season.

Our poor form now is because of: injuries, too many players. According to the excuse machine that‚Äôs constantly spit out. Please find me where Potter has had to deal with the club being sanctioned and not knowing how his players will be paid or how they‚Äôll travel to away games? 

People complain about no nuance in this sub and then try to discredit our prior success by saying ‚Äúwe were just as shit under Tuchel‚Äù. How many times have we scored 1 goal in a month under Tuchel? How many times did we go 2/15 under Tuchel? 

We are Shit because of the manager and people who like to pretend that the club had been shit for over a year, have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. Nearly 30% of our points have come from Tuchel, in 6 games where he was in charge. In 18 games since Potter has been appointed, we‚Äôve scored 21 points.

He should‚Äôve been sacked after Soton and we will be out of everything this time next week, so by that point why even sack him.",Chelsea,Yes,janqwbo,t1_jan5y96
"We played awesome football under Tuchel, in fact we beat the best in the world to win the UCL, honestly the 343 system and the tactical prowess that tuchel installed in this team was unbeatable. That's why he saw the future in a 343 with the quality of our wing backs, we only needed to strengthen some key positions in midfield and defense. 

Yet you only remember the ugly and the bad after the heartbreaking loss   to RM despite us winning in the Bernab√©u last season. That was due to lots of reasons, the main ones being that lots of players checked out mentally like Christensen, rudiger and most of our attackers, plus crippling injuries all over.  Have some shame, respect Tuchels work despite the sanctions and the board's shit contract decisions.",Chelsea,Yes,janfyqx,t1_jan5y96
"Simply speaking, TT would have my trust that he could bring back energy into the squad with the right transfers. He knows our issues are actually in the midfield and the defense, and then we needed the right strikers. I think he had a stopgap solution with Auba, a player he had worked with before. I also knew there was a system: just the issue was it wasn't working well.

That's completely different from now: I can't see jack shit. This is why I love TT, and I think he was the one for Chelsea. To be fair, I also thought it was Conte.",Chelsea,Yes,jan82mj,t1_jan5y96

Mount will definitely adjust a bit, but he is not going to bend for us, him not accepting hust anything doesn't make him less loyal.

See if maybe someone would take Cucurella for a fair deal. Maybe a Spanish team.

"It's a time game for all of them really.

Cucurella has struggled but so has everyone else, plus he's had a lot of off-field stuff going on on top. Gets a second season regardless for me.

Chilwell just needs to get consistent reps again before we can truly get a good grasp of where he is post-injury. Again, no real decision to be made right now.

Maatsen has looked promising in the Championship but also untried at the top level. Like Chilwell he needs a period of consistent football at this level to get a proper feel for where he's truly at. 

I think we can quite easily go into next season with all three in the squad, and it probably wouldn't be the worse decision to make given Chilwell's injury woes. Worst case if Cucurella and Chilwell find their touch again next season we send Maatsen out on loan in January.",Chelsea,Yes,japonz8,t1_jao170k

">Ok go ahead tell me why this wouldn't work and we'd get laughed off the field with Potter anyway..just kidding! This has to work, right? Right!??

There are some weaknesses with that formation that has to do with our players at the moment. Reece and Chilwell are yet to return to their forms as they've had a great deal of injuries to overcome recently. RLC and Cucurella are not ideal wing-backs. The former is best as a midfielder, also poor at providing width; while the latter is a conservative FB. In the front 3, there's no one to provide goal threats in the 6 yd.

">Sport doesn‚Äôt work like that. Hansi Flick, the guy people want to replace Potter, never won anything. He replaced a respected coach in Niko Kovac and instantly formed a connection. They won the Champions League. 

Flick is a unique situation though because he was part of Bayern's staff for a while. He knew the players inside out and they trusted him after having worked with him. Same as Terzic at Dortmund. It's why I still have some doubts over Flick at other clubs - he didn't reinvent the wheel at Bayern, he simply played to their strengths that he knew perfectly well. It was a great squad that just needed to go back to what it did best. He won't have that luxury anywhere else and I'm not sure he'd do as well.

>Tuchel‚Äôs didn‚Äôt have the backing of many players and it didn‚Äôt work out on the pitch.

"Extremely valid points here. I don't think we would be in this rut if TT had these players , 100%. I think his experience would have turned us around but there is a reason he isn't here, more than just the new ownership. 

The sanctions and selling and all that stuff, that's once in a lifetime for sure. Tuchel handled that. We also got spanked a few times in April, notably the 4-1 Brentford embarrassment and then I think we only won ONE game in May. This form continued at the start of the current season. That's all I'm saying about Tuchel, we were in a bad way before this season even kicked off and then had some embarrassing losses at the start. 

I love TT, loved his energy and charisma. Would love to have a beer with him. I did feel a change in as necessary when he was sacked. Didn't know Potter was going to be the guy but hey, he's the guy now and I back my club. That's the point of the entire post. Backing the club who, for once, is not just sacking the manager even if he deserves it.

"I watched both of them at youth level for us, with Colwill the potential was obvious but I had doubts over Maatsen because of his size.

It's worth remembering that Maatsen has had two loans prior to Burnley, at Charlton in League One and Coventry in the Championship, whereas Colwill stepped straight into the Championship with Huddersfield.

That being said, I've loved his role under Kompany and think he would be brilliant for us there. He's proved that he can play high and wide as a wingback, arrive into the box from the left, as well as invert into midfield in a 2-3-5 build-up. He has a lot of promise for a good tactician.

Even if he needs one more loan once Burnley are promoted, I think it would be worth handing him a boosted contract renewal with guarantees of a place in the squad the following season if he performs well. That would give us another year to evaluate Cucurella and Chilwell as well.

I think Hall will be out on loan next year as we're high on numbers and he is one of the easier names to move on for the season. He'll also need the playing time to develop, but I'm excited for him.

It would be a shame to lose Chilly but he is definitely the easier of the pair to move on, with reported interest from City. He's just so likeable and proved a lot of people wrong here, he definitely feels like one of us. 

I like Cucurella too though, he has a lot of tactical versatility and I wanted us to sign him (not at that price), but god he's been awful. It can only get better though.",Chelsea,Yes,jaoi0ju,t1_jaogam1
">I think we can quite easily go into next season with all three in the squad, and it probably wouldn't be the worse decision to make given Chilwell's injury woes. Worst case if Cucurella and Chilwell find their touch again next season we send Maatsen out on loan in January.

I would agree, but at the same time our squad is already bloated as it is, so adding an extra left-back is going to make it even more difficult. I'm not against it though if we can whittle down the numbers.",Chelsea,Yes,jar3pq0,t1_japonz8

"But why can't Felix play striker? I ask after watching Havertz play striker for 2/3 years. Felix can be every bit and better than Havertz at striker (and is a placeholder for Nkunku in the long term anyway). Havertz as a free-roaming attacking mid in a narrow 3, behind Felix might work. Hell, Mount looked great in that AM role. Sterling is ideal for that third attacking left-sided role too, and can switch with Felix, but Mudryk/Madueke will need some work. Mudryk was also a LM who likes dropping deep to pick up the ball and drive, and he has the technical ability to adapt to that role in my view. I just want to play Havertz ""in his natural position"". Since he isn't creative enough to be a lone AM, this way we use him the best imo with 2 other quick forwards around him.

While injuries to wingbacks mean we'll have to play lesser options there, its still the best formation for the team as a whole.

"Even in the worse forms under Tuchel we were scoring one goal a calendar month. We have scored the least amount of goals in all professional leagues in all of England since November. That‚Äôs not just bad form, that‚Äôs just an all time bad production from our squad.

Now I‚Äôm not chanting to have Tuchel back and I believe he left because the owners didn‚Äôt like him, and that‚Äôs fine. We can let the past be with Tuchel and leave it at that, but we can‚Äôt just do that when it‚Äôs convenient for people‚Äôs arguments. The same people saying ‚ÄúTUCHEL ISNT COMING BACK, BACK THE CLUB‚Äù are the same ones saying ‚ÄúWE WERE JUST AS BAD UNDER TUCHEL‚Äù. Which is just a gross over exaggeration of the actual events.

And we were in a bad run of form in May, in the heat of takeover and sanctions talk. Geez, I wonder why the team performed so badly then. Was it because important club leader Rudiger was on the brink of leaving for Madrid because we couldn‚Äôt offer him a new deal if we wanted to? Other players as well who didn‚Äôt know what the future has in store for them? If anybody should get the benefit of the doubt it‚Äôs Tuchel who win major trophies with us and navigated us during arguably one of If not the hardest time in the clubs history.

And I agree we should‚Äôve scored more points under Tuchel, and we should have 2 more points after we got robbed against Spurs.

It's not even an argument, it's a statement. Please stop bringing up Tuchel. Not even going to entertain your plastic remark. Drogba brought me to Chelsea. How many times did he play for Tuchel? Clown. 

And I never said ignore Potter or his run so far. Potter has a good start. Then injuries, then WC, then a whole new squad, and here we are. With the squad we have a tin post should be able to find us some goals. It's lacking and clearly not the standard. 

But I thought we were tired of canning managers when they hit a rut, much like TT. Now of course he also didn't fit the new owners agenda, but losing games makes getting fired easier.

"No - I did not like the way we started the season. But I'm not willing to be obtuse and not consider everything happening.

1. Plenty of reports outlined how busy the takeover was for Tuchel. Tuchel wasn't able to attend the majority of team trainings due to having to meeting with Todd and Co. through this whole process.
2. Tuchel was also required to play recruiter, director of football, among a handful of other positions that took over his responsibility as team manager. Directly resulting in performance drop from the team

There's a reason we had one of the best defenses and a 61% win rate when Tuchel was around playing his role as manager. There are also plenty of reasons post TB & Co. why performance dropped when he was forced to move out of his manager role, to wear many different hats.

And that's something that plenty of people around here aren't willing to admit because it's easy to say -- we started the season shit. Mind you 1/3 of the goals scored to date, were under tuchel (he only managed Chelsea for 6 out of the 24 matches played this season). 33% of goals to date from 25% of matches managed

Tuchel wasn't dominating the league at the start of this season; he was also not able to commit the majority of his time to manage the team like he was last season, to get the best out of them.

One of the gripes of our team for a while has been an ever-shifting starting 11 - of course this is mainly due to injuries and now a very bloated squad. But the implications of switching players too often is what we are seeing now, almost 0 connection/ patterns with our players. This wasn't helped by us buying so many new players within the space of a couple windows. 

Once we have a solid foundation of a starting 11, we will see these patterns emerge more frequently. It's not been good enough recently, nowhere near good enough but we see glimpses of these patterns in our play.

Again there's nothing wrong as long as you get desired performances and results but it doesn't make sense to keep on playing them when you have already invested 100s of Millions on their replacements already.

Also, can we try it before we knock it? Felix as a striker I mean. Can't say for sure that it would or would not work, but I think we can both agree that Havertz doesn't work as a striker. Even during our CL run, Timo was the LW/Inside forward who created space for Havertz regularly. Sterling can do that role for Felix.

That first window was a piece of shit (17 levels imo) and the winter one was good for the players we got but too many at the same time as whilst adding to a bloated squad and not having a well defined structure in place just makes everyone look worse than they are.

They had a really bad scoring record though, which looks to have made its way here also (which is actually mind boggling because how is that the manager's fault yet it's followed him from one club to another). 

With better players it made sense that we should be able to replicate that style of play and improve the level of finishing in much better time than what's actually played out.

"Apparently, Potter is failing at identifying and implementing strategies and tactics at the most fundamental level of football.

Watched the players with the ball in promising situations without knowing what to do next is quite disheartening. More often in attack, there is no designated player on the wing to hold width with substantial threats. All of our wingers have already tasted injury this season alone. And when they do, they seem to not know whether to go inside or outside, cross or cut-in and shoot. In the box, we don't have a stable amount of hold-up play anymore. Not even Aubameyang is renowned for that quality. Don't want to talk about Ziyech now. Havertz has already become a shadow of himself. F√©lix is trying to conjure up chances through his skills but that alone has proven not to be enough and sustainable in the long run. Another conundrum is Sterling. How do we utilize him in line-up? Should he play as an out-and-out winger or as an inside-forward? If he plays as the latter, he will be needing width (wing-back) for support. It is glaring that Noni and Murdryk need more PL experience to set themselves up. 

Despite having a bloated midfield, we appear to be struggling there as there's less physicality available. Too many CMs with different playing styles would give any manager headache. From an unavailable Kante and Kovacic to the to the out-of-form Mount and Loftus-Cheek to the inexperienced Gallagher, Hall and Chukwuemeka. How is Potter addressing this now as well as at the end of the season? Some might clamour a return to a midfield 3 to accommodate the majority, but is that enough? I personally think Mase should improve as a CM or forget about Chelsea as it stands. Also that Potter should be playing Enzo higher up the pitch with someone being him (Zakaria/RLC/Chalobah) while we get someone of quality in the summer. 

Defensively, we seem to be better. Now that T. Silva is out till April, can Potter ask the team to be braver and proactive defensively by playing a high line because we're pretty shit at doing that at the moment? If he is opting for that, the defence is going to be needing a ton of help from the attack. Now is the most opportune time to for Fofana and Badiashile to build chemistry. Will the LB be Cucurella or Chilwell as the latter is yet to regain himself? Do we buildup with a 3-2 with inverted FBs or do we stick with the 4-2? How worse would Chalobah perform in the DM? 

The amount of coordination and synchronization in the recent games is appalling. It's like we do not have a plan for a match. It's dreadful and embarrassing. The team needs urgency and character. Potter needs to do something.",Chelsea,No,jaieojk,t3_11evx6c

If we're being kind and saying that maybe his decline was because of this injury and that he just needed this break to finally recover it'll still take him a while to get back up to speed and even then I don't think he'll be what turns this team around. As great as Kante is, even at his best he couldn't save these performances by himself. We'll likely improve, and again that's assuming he comes back as the same player we saw years ago, but not as much as we'd hope.

I know people are just looking for reasons to be optimistic and I can't fault that but please don't get your hopes up too high.

Potter's allegedly implied it's tough to train with the big squad but if it's that much of an issue, or if certain players sulking in the dressing room are that much of a problem, then you have to be brave and make the call to exclude them for the next couple of months before they're sold.

He did enough to warrant more time and players better suited for him and that was without the hindsight that's only made that clearer. It is what it is though and there's no way he's coming back.

Sterling would be perfect for the rw spot for sarri, mudryk is surprisingly a good passer and makes good runs in behind. Felix would likely be his striker

Leading Chelsea isn't the same as leading small clubs these are millionaires set for life If you don't have  a inspired leader as  a coach they lose focus and won't perform and it is going to continue like this until Potter is sacked. Just shows how good of a coach Pep is and it isn't only about the money City spent,Chelsea,Yes,jagxsfp,t1_jagekbm
"I made this point when he was hired. That we've seen all sorts of talented coaches at the Bridge and the ones that succeeded didn't do so just because they were way more talented than other. 

The intangible qualities like acting like a real leader and inspiring/motivating the players just that little bit to get the best out of them is equally important. Again those sort of coaches don't last a long while but will give you a successful cycle of 2-3 years. 

Potter might be a talented coach but if he's unable to inspire Champions League winners and players with understandably big egos to buy into his methods, there's just no point. He won't be the first hyped up promising manager to fail at those simple aspects.",Chelsea,Yes,jah1q6l,t1_jagekbm
"Confidence & mentality is a huge part of football. They are good players but at rock bottom. And the manager isn't really helpful.

Similar stuff happened under Mourinho in 2015/16 with better players. Mourinho was great but even he couldn't get them out of the rut.",Chelsea,Yes,jagg14r,t1_jagekbm
Whatever Potter wants is not coming out as intended in our new 4231. Tuchel coached us with clear passing patterns which over time got figured out and it became hard for us to score. Potter is trying to coach something more free flowing which is extremely difficult with the bloated squad. You need a set squad of players to understand each other on a deep level instead of chopping and changing all the time. Players like Ziyech and Aubameyang and even K2 who have a high chance of not being here next season should be nowhere near the squad. Send them a bloody Conte text and tell them thanks for the seasono but you're not in the plans,Chelsea,Yes,jagtjt1,t1_jagekbm
"Everything is at fault for our season right now. It‚Äôs not just down to one thing. It‚Äôs an extremely complex predicament that‚Äôs been bubbling since that game at home v Leeds in December 2021. It‚Äôs a little bit of the players exhausted/loss of confidence, it‚Äôs a little bit of players who have all but been told they have no future here beyond this season giving up, it‚Äôs a little bit of players who wanted out last summer and not getting their move away just coasting to the finish line, it‚Äôs a little bit of Tuchel who lost the dressing room, it‚Äôs a little bit of Potter who was a competent coach in August now approaching this job utterly clueless like he was a fan off the street by abandoning his principles and reaching for solutions that aren‚Äôt there, it‚Äôs a little bit of the massive upheaval at the club both on and off the pitch in a very short amount of time, it‚Äôs also the fact that the main core of existing players have played the most games in Europe since 2020 with very little reprieve in between have reached their wits end going into this season. 

It‚Äôs silly for anyone to pin this on one person manager or player when quite frankly it‚Äôs been all of it. I‚Äôve been watching football a long time and strictly speaking for this season, I do not know how you fix it. Sacking Potter isn‚Äôt the reprieve many think it will be. We‚Äôve already seen these players lose to Southampton and Leeds before Potter. Potter deserves sacking don‚Äôt get me wrong after the Spurs game but Tuchel couldn‚Äôt squeeze anymore out of these guys and that‚Äôs before we got the January transfers who are at differing fitness levels and are struggling to mesh with each other. It‚Äôs a bad situation that has no immediate fix. The best anyone can hope is that we get through to the end of this season, mass clear out of players by any means necessary and have a workable squad in preseason. That‚Äôs Vivell‚Äôs responsibility this summer. A total failure if the squad numbers aren‚Äôt cut down for Potter or the new manager.",Chelsea,Yes,jagm7k8,t1_jagekbm

"Under Tuchel Chilwell started scoring more goals because he'd move inwards more and play inverted(in the 21/22 season). I think that they don't have to always overlap or always underlap as long as there's understanding between the two.

That being said mudryk needs to be better in 1 Vs 1 situations. You could see how Sterling was leaving Emerson and Romero for dead 1 Vs 1 but outside of a 37 year old Milner I've seen nothing of the sort from mudryk.",Chelsea,Yes,jaidi8x,t1_jaictmj
"The thing is that Mudryk needs a player like Chilwell who will get forward and overlap, otherwise, teams will be able to double mark Mudryk and get the ball off him easily(like we saw with Cucurella and why he didn‚Äôt get the ball as much vs West Ham). He had a similar type of LB at Shaktar, but the thing is he knew when to overlap/when to sit back. I think the more Chilwell and Mudryk play together, the more they will figure this out, and right now, it is merely a chemistry issue. Just my thoughts though.",Chelsea,Yes,jaimzlw,t1_jaictmj
"My crazy thought of the day is to wonder if Mudryk could play as a striker. He‚Äôs two-footed, just as fast as Timo, but a much better dribbler and shooter, with the same questionable first touch though. Playing him as the 9 would let Felix play as the LW, Mount or Kai as the 10, and Sterling as the RW. Or you let Sterling play his favored LW, Felix in middle and shoe-horn Mount/Kai/Madueke as the RW or maybe Pulisic when he‚Äôs back (or Pulisic subs on for the LW)

CBs would be really wary of Mudryk‚Äôs pace in behind so it would probably open up space for the 10.",Chelsea,Yes,jairawg,t1_jaictmj

Tired of people acting like Potter can claim anything even if miracle happens, Potter himself has said the results are bad, and fans have been fair.

Then consider we‚Äôre only buying from the u25 age bracket from here on out and our options are even more limited.

When there's a very clear plan for the structure of the team it becomes easier to make those ruthless decisions. Easier for the manager to sell those decisions to the owners too. I think a big part of the issue Potter has is that he didn't seem to have a clear plan in the beginning. He was changing the shape and tactics and lineups every game and trying to assess. While the world cup was going on he must've tried to draw something up and asked the owners to get him some players. But when those ideas didn't click either then he has no clout to make tough decisions with. Squad decisions are now about freshness or who needs a mental break. He's now scrambling for results and just rolling dice with his squad and hoping that some random combination he hasn't tried yet will work.,Chelsea,Yes,jaiqqsc,t1_jaigo9l
"> Maybe Boehly and co don't want him to do that because it hurts their negotiating position when it comes to selling them in the summer but our embarrassing league position is what I'm worried about.

Exactly, we need to put the performances and results on the pitch ahead of transfer values.  
We absolutely need to cut the squad down to 25. Bin Auba and Ziyech. We can also send the younger signings like Carney and D Fofana to the U23 as well. Just explain to them the reasons why, that until we move on some players in the summer they just don't have room in the first team.

They weren't good in the Europa League and dropped out of a group that should have been very doable though.

"Why though, Sarri‚Äôs football is a lot better than whatever we‚Äôre doing right now",Chelsea,Yes,jah2inp,t1_jah0jya
Nightmares over the 60m Barkley sub every game without fail. Tbf it's always the Italian managers who have the same 3 subs over and over again.,Chelsea,Yes,jah3r4q,t1_jah0jya
Mount hasn‚Äôt pressed since 2020. Just no,Chelsea,Yes,jahaaca,t1_jah0qyk
Seriously. We thought those days were over when Lampard was given 3 yr and Tuchel 18 months,Chelsea,Yes,jagw2e6,t1_jagqafh
Why would he come then? Just for a vacation?,Chelsea,Yes,jahasr3,t1_jagqafh
Not sure he'd take a 1 year contract.,Chelsea,Yes,jagqd69,t1_jagqafh
Yeah lol. He‚Äôs most likely back in RM next season.,Chelsea,Yes,jahe4de,t1_jah5ijp
"Exactly, not just the ownership not looking for a big name, but i doubt most big name managers would even like the constant involvement of the owners in the day to day of the club",Chelsea,Yes,jah1xju,t1_jah0e38
Idk much about Enrique so why is he worse?,Chelsea,Yes,jahagxp,t1_jah3unx
"Yep, allows potential for a good deal and give broja some minutes when he‚Äôs back",Chelsea,Yes,jaiqbkv,t1_jaini30
How insufferable are the Potter in folks gonna be if we beat Leeds 1-0?,Chelsea,Yes,jak8vqj,t1_jajghvy
Chelsea will sign a DM and striker this summer and probably reinforce each transfer session... There is no way Chelsea won't improve over these years no matter the coach,Chelsea,Yes,jai2mff,t1_jahwlif
Lool you read what I said and replied to your own agenda that you already have pre-loaded. I'm talking about the stability of the club as a whole mate,Chelsea,Yes,jahscgn,t1_jahph6w
"I'm sorry, but when should he have had multiple goals and assists? He's done *nothing* since the Liverpool game. Not a thing.",Chelsea,Yes,jajtp7e,t1_jajn9om
"I don't think it's that they don't want to play for him, it's that he's soft, and these players need a manager to actually lead them. Tuchel was a leader. Potter isn't. I think it's fine at a mid table club but his style doesn't work at a big club.",Chelsea,Yes,jago1hv,t1_jagfu80
"Well apparently they like Potter. That's what rumours have been going around.

Problem is Potter himself hasn't dealt with pressure of this level, so how would he instill the confidence in team when he himself is losing it.",Chelsea,Yes,jaggltq,t1_jagfu80
We have 3 healthy options in CL for CB. K2 absolutely needs to be training with the squad.,Chelsea,Yes,jai7t1e,t1_jagtjt1
You telling me a different manager won't get more than 2 wins in 16?,Chelsea,Yes,jahmx3z,t1_jagm7k8
Lol.,Chelsea,Yes,jagucc7,t1_jagm7k8
What if the process is all the friends we make along the way?,Chelsea,Yes,jahcuwj,t1_jahcnkl
Cook,Chelsea,Yes,jahnmoj,t1_jahicw0
Enzo is all the midfield creativity you need. He's not being able to show it at the moment because he's been used deep rather than being allowed to play freely. It's imperative that we get a proper DM to allow him to play in his favourite position,Chelsea,Yes,jahyx13,t1_jahx2rw
"That loan fee is now a sunk cost. Why invest in Felix‚Äôs value anymore, unless the club is certain they‚Äôre going to be able to make it a permanent, at the expense of the players you actually own?",Chelsea,Yes,jahnlvv,t1_jahl479
The loan didn‚Äôt make any sense in the first place unless Boehly though we were going to push for top 4.,Chelsea,Yes,jai4cab,t1_jahl479
That 15M is wasted regardless if he plays or not. The club also spent 18M on Carney and have homegrown players like Mount and Gallagher who could also play in that position and gather more experience which helps their and the clubs long-term future. This season is an absolute waste. There‚Äôs very little difference in money between finishing 10th and finishing 16th or 8th,Chelsea,Yes,jaih0qr,t1_jaicxoz
Just like how people who were excited about Mourinho's title winning seasons don't have egg on their face just because he had a terrible 15/16 season. Weird energy coming off there.,Chelsea,Yes,jajmm4n,t1_jaji2we

19",Chelsea,Yes,jajvbcs,t1_jaji2we
"Say Potter does turn things around, we go and beat Leeds and Dortmund, Kante comes back and we kick on and win 10 out of 12 odd games and get back up to 5th or 6th and get Europa.   
You could make the argument that all the excuses he's used/been given (injuries, new owners, change in structure, too many signings, huge squad etc) were valid, and that given the time he did actually fix things.  
Will that happen? Unlikely, but if it did, then it kinda would prove his point re: the reasons we are where we are.",Chelsea,Yes,jajz3j1,t1_jaji2we
"Double or nothing, tattoo Potters face on top of your face on scale 1:1",Chelsea,Yes,jaqh25u,t1_jak3g0a
"He posted a statement and he mentioned something about 6 months. Makes no sense what's happening, maybe different bet circumstances",Chelsea,Yes,jajnvly,t1_jagojau
"I think people in comments discussed whether they should have given games ban instead of a certain period but some people suggested getting loaned to some Norwegian third division to get the games ban rolling during the summer is a workaround

I have no clue what is exactly happening, I asked in that thread and here",Chelsea,Yes,jagn3zf,t1_jagm26s
"Yes, but James is better than all of our attackers and him rarely getting into the box or even into crossing positions is a big part of our attacking impotence.

At the very least we should try a hybrid between 3411/4231. Especially when Cucurella is playing - have Cucurella stay back in possession as he‚Äôs useless going forward anyways, and give James the freedom to bomb forward and play as a wingback. James tucking into midfield is a massive waste of his ability.",Chelsea,Yes,jagvr5o,t1_jagtirs
"He needs to cull the squad honestly‚Ä¶ 

Pick a starting 11 and give them some time. I‚Äôd love to see James Fofana Badiashele Chilly Enzo Kante Felix Mudryk Sterling Havertz play a few games in a row. 

Sure you can sub off Kante, Reece and Chilly or occasionally rotate them but let them build synergy together",Chelsea,Yes,jah99db,t1_jagsg5p
Either way we are dead,Chelsea,Yes,jagho9d,t1_jaghlvq
Who wasn‚Äôt awful vs Spurs?,Chelsea,Yes,jai3d8l,t1_jahypqv

"Pretty much every coach has to start somewhere, Tuchel and Klopp were both at mid-table Mainz before getting a bigger job",Chelsea,Yes,jahetf1,t1_jahcy83
"Lavia is good. But Rice is a level above, I feel. And has shown he can play in multiple positions. I'm too sceptical about Bundesliga products. Kone is definitely a talent.

If money is an issue, I think we should just keep Zak",Chelsea,Yes,jagwe5p,t1_jagw8tw
"Lavia will cost silly money too, lol",Chelsea,Yes,jagwlmg,t1_jagw8tw
You're right on the wages. We wont have Europe revenues for the next season. Need to be tight on the books,Chelsea,Yes,jah20a8,t1_jah1w1u
"Romano reported we've offered a pretty big money on the summer deadline day when Shields was at Southampton, the interest most likely originates from some advisory firm or something that recommending Lavia like Anthony Gordon and some other transfers. Rice is a ready made player who'd also benefit the team off the pitch greatly, but instead they will probably continue to hoard teenagers without thinking about squad harmony",Chelsea,Yes,jah6985,t1_jah1w1u
Yeah. Had read about those reports. I'm curious on how he was shortlisted given we didn't have a recruitment/data division in summer,Chelsea,Yes,jah019i,t1_jagz2g0
"‚ÄòFreedom of speech is important, unless it goes against my views‚Äô. 

They can cry all they want, Tuchel isn‚Äôt coming back.",Chelsea,Yes,jagmm2q,t1_jaglqtd
"We played sufferball under Tuchel, and everyone is begging to have him back.

Simeone is proven at building successful sides and  winning titles, whilst also spending a long period of time at a club with no issues. We‚Äôd be silly not to consider if he‚Äôs attainable and we give up on Potter.",Chelsea,Yes,jai852u,t1_jai761m
"By ""Chelsea of old"", do you mean under Roman? Or the old Terry, Lampard, Drogba squad?",Chelsea,Yes,jai7iox,t1_jai6f6w
"And after seeing our current state, nobody will be willing to join",Chelsea,Yes,jagtqw9,t1_jags6em
Even Danny ings would have been better than Havertz,Chelsea,Yes,jagskob,t1_jags6em
Far from terrible,Chelsea,Yes,jaj80df,t1_jaiyl11
U got that right friend,Chelsea,Yes,jahtekx,t1_jahtb04
Imagine being Abraham back who's not been any better than Havertz this season,Chelsea,Yes,jak59zx,t1_jak3ryr
"Go look at the line ups, lavia and perraud were the only two players who started against us compared to starting last night.


This also isn't me sucking us off and saying we're amazing. Just keep your criticisms based in reality, because therr are plenty of legitimate ones to choose from.",Chelsea,Yes,jakii86,t1_jak92qu
Cool vague posting,Chelsea,Yes,jak3rvf,t1_jak3e5e
"ahh tbh I didn't know he had this in his locker

"We would have made Mahrez looked bang average here, let's not kid ourselves.",Chelsea,Yes,jaha23g,t1_jah8zac
Zakaria is the closest in profile to Kante however he's not good enough to start for us.,Chelsea,Yes,jaicfmf,t1_jai5w4l
I wouldn‚Äôt mind as long as somebody starts scoring‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt keep being shut out like this. Horrible for the team morale. Horrible for us to watch. The next goal is going to feel like the first for the season.,Chelsea,Yes,jakwyj2,t1_jakvn93
"Who mentioned Newcastle?

I guess you couldn‚Äôt see that this club was in decline? And that brining in Aubameyang, CuCu, and KK didn‚Äôt help, but made it worse? Or that TT was so stressed that he had to go to India to a specialized healing centre? 

You remember 2015/16? That squad finished 10th, where had they finished the past 4 years? What did they win in 2012? These things happen. No team stays at the top forever. They go through cycles. 

Right now, no one in the top 4, aside from City, have been relevant for several years. We want to pretend that Chelsea had a chance? No fucking way. Where had they finished in the table? When was the last time they won the prem? Losing to Liverpool in two separate cup competitions last year should have explained this team didn‚Äôt have what it took to be successful. A rebuild was and is needed.",Chelsea,Yes,jakwree,t1_jakw5kp
"Haha no worries! I have no problem being corrected when I‚Äôm wrong. 

I do have a problem with the miserable pricks in this club claiming doom and gloom every 5 seconds, and then being even more hate filled when someone tries to look at the bright side.",Chelsea,Yes,jalyv92,t1_jalsmfd
"Very underrated season, and one that massively contributed to our CL-win. It just gets lost because the brexit-fans wanted to shout about Jorginho and how Sarri wasn't a ""Chelsea-man"" - which we now see again with Potter. The squad he inherited from Conte was awful and he just binned Cahill, Bakayoko, Drinkwater, Morata, Cesc. The push to get a ball-playing goalie was really good, but the board bottled it with Alisson and gave us Kepa instead.   

CHO, RLC, Christensen all had a great season, but injuries ruined it for the first two, and the Jorginho, Kovacic, Kant√© midfield is what Tuchel relied on for our CL-win. It was a really nice transition to Lamps as well, as he could then add Mount, Reece, Chilly, Silva, Tammy.   
The way he got Hazard involved was also a major improvement on that last season of Conte. The ¬£130m we then sold him for is maybe the best sale we've ever made.",Chelsea,Yes,jahceyn,t1_jah737g
"Tbf anything is better than under Potter but I'm sure I'm not the only one who felt utterly dejected when we were struggling under Sarri. 

Rob Greene even came out with the stories of how the players literally revolted against the manager and his ideas.",Chelsea,Yes,jah3bsx,t1_jah2inp
To think Barkley was once an important player for the team ffs. Only good thing about the the whole thing was the Barkley memes.,Chelsea,Yes,jai0cn5,t1_jah3r4q
This just isn‚Äôt true,Chelsea,Yes,jai59a9,t1_jahaaca
Because he‚Äôs currently jobless?,Chelsea,Yes,jahbzqp,t1_jahasr3
Just put a clause that says you‚Äôre good as gone if we‚Äôre 10th before end of the year.,Chelsea,Yes,jagqj7y,t1_jagqd69
This failed experiment might just lead them to change their minds about it. Hopefully. We can only speculate at this point but I definitely believe a coach with a bigger reputation would sort most of our issues out.,Chelsea,Yes,jah2oh8,t1_jah1xju
"I don't know about worse, but he has underperformed at Roma and with Spain. He did well at Barca, but there are questions over whether that was him or just Barca being a very experienced and talented team (much in the way that Avram Grant and Di Matteo were able to get good results with the spine of those Jose teams). I suspect he is a fine manager, but I don't really know how good he is.",Chelsea,Yes,jai6oyj,t1_jahagxp
i‚Äôve heard a lot of not so good but also watching spain in that world cup match‚Ä¶ yikes,Chelsea,Yes,jahcel4,t1_jahagxp
did you watch spain at the world cup,Chelsea,Yes,jahcdqh,t1_jahagxp
"God, don't even bring it up.",Chelsea,Yes,jalp51q,t1_jak8vqj
"To be honest I don't see potter managing 20 points in the last 14 games. 15-16 points for a grand finish of 46 points, 65  points next year is an almost 50% improvement. More than enough improvement  for this regime.",Chelsea,Yes,jai38pp,t1_jai2mff
Do you think you're not incredibly transparent?,Chelsea,Yes,jahtdt5,t1_jahscgn
"Tbf should've had a great assist vs west ham but havertz mistimed his run, other than that though i cant think of anything.",Chelsea,Yes,jak1nnf,t1_jajtp7e
"We‚Äôve missed him on open runs several times where he would‚Äôve had a great chance at scoring. He‚Äôs also had several good passes outside of the Liverpool match that could have led to goals for normally functioning teams, but we can‚Äôt score so it didn‚Äôt happen.",Chelsea,Yes,jajvk4s,t1_jajtp7e
"When the guy who owns the club likes to reinforce his belief in potter 3 times a day, as a player, you can't really say much against him",Chelsea,Yes,jaghfyq,t1_jaggltq
Shouldn‚Äôt a healthy Kante fix this problem?,Chelsea,Yes,jahzxyp,t1_jahyx13
"Why the fuck are we playing Ziyech then, when he was already banging outside PSG's door begging to be let in? Lol. This club isn't thinking that far ahead enough. Potter will play whoever he thinks will make him win.",Chelsea,Yes,jahpxi1,t1_jahnlvv
"I guess the season isn't done until we lose to Dortmund.

I think if we do lose to Dortmund more focus should be on getting mounts form back up again as well as bringin chukwuemeka and Gallagher some gametime to see if they can improve (not a fan of Gallagher but aware that he needs gametime even if the aim is to sell him). 

I also understand that nkunku will be offering what Felix supposedly offers in the summer.",Chelsea,Yes,jaihktu,t1_jaih0qr
"Yeah my bad 19, it still close to half a season as I meant.",Chelsea,Yes,jalpugm,t1_jajvbcs
"No you can't make that argument. Because he has only Kante out as major absence now, that happens with any manager, injuries doesn't become zero. If he needs everything perfect for results,then he is shit anyway. And most importantly we aren't where we are, justifiably, we were at the very least top 4 team even with injuries, if we are at this level even after adding 600m worth of players then it's bad, injuries also have gone and we are still getting dominated by managerless 20th team. So no Potter can't justify anything, after going half a season with 2 wins.",Chelsea,Yes,jalproh,t1_jajz3j1
"Yeah, i just dont see how they allow him to get away with it, cause then every player would do this kinda shit, and the amount of charges is huge so im assuming they make an example out of him",Chelsea,Yes,jagonsh,t1_jagn3zf
"Or put Badiashile, Silva and Fofana in defence and allow Chilwell and Reece to go forward. I have more faith in them to score than our attackers. When Kante is back this system becomes even more viable.",Chelsea,Yes,jah2765,t1_jagvr5o
Well I know that if cucu played against spurs he would‚Äôve been scape goated,Chelsea,Yes,jaid83u,t1_jai3d8l
Why don't we get Vincent Kompany he has to start somewhere right.,Chelsea,Yes,jahxcbl,t1_jahetf1
Yeah and they shouldn't fucking get their first big move at Chelsea.,Chelsea,Yes,jahnnh0,t1_jahetf1
i agree with you but everyone has a trauma because of that fraud,Chelsea,Yes,jahk3se,t1_jahetf1
It's harder to judge managers without some inside knowledge as to how they work and what their plans are. That's why we've hired a platoon of directors. Hopefully they get it right.,Chelsea,Yes,jahml4e,t1_jahetf1
"We can still keep Zak as a backup as well, ideally we need 2 DMs anyways.",Chelsea,Yes,jagwjza,t1_jagwe5p
"Maybe money wouldn't be an issue if we didn't spunk money on attackers without sorting our midfield out or pay 15M for a 3 month loan on an attacker who would be lucky to get over 7 G+A.

Lmao if we are starting Zakaria next season, we're in trouble. 

Quite clearly we're chancing it on Kantes fitness while we wait for someone real good to come along.",Chelsea,Yes,jah3aww,t1_jagwe5p
"Soton are going down lol, he won‚Äôt be as expensive",Chelsea,Yes,jagx51t,t1_jagwlmg
europe has been gone for a while and look at our january window,Chelsea,Yes,jah3qm0,t1_jah20a8
Rice is good but then they're extending Kante as well. Not sure but I don't think we'll spend big on another midfielder in the summer.,Chelsea,Yes,jai0lv8,t1_jah6985
I've wondered that. Neil Bath I suppose,Chelsea,Yes,jah4wxf,t1_jah019i
Because he scored the winner against us and that's how Boehly picks players,Chelsea,Yes,jah1tzq,t1_jah019i
"Would be a mistake to bring him back anyway. Players downed tools for him, they didn't even bother picking them up when potter arrived. I don't care how bad potter is, our players have been absolute dog shit and should be embarrassed.",Chelsea,Yes,jagt5vp,t1_jagmm2q
"We didn't play sufferball lmao.

I swear man people think managers who focus on defence play the exact same way.

When we played anyone other than man city we tended to dominate the ball or be equal possession wise. How many arsenal games under Tuchel were just them getting scalps from opposition mistakes while we dominated the ball? Same for the United matches under Tuchel 

I don't want Tuchel back but it is 9 year old level of analysis to compare Simeones football to Tuchel because we did a park bus job on man city.",Chelsea,Yes,jaibl5m,t1_jai852u
"Somewhere around the Mou mk 2 squad would have been good. But I feel like we‚Äôve tried to move from that profile around 2011 or so and it‚Äôs been a hodgepodge of players. 

I also don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd get the same leeway as he did in Atleti where he practically brought them to modern success.",Chelsea,Yes,jai8rn6,t1_jai7iox
"Just a phrase, bud. 

I think he'd be an Ok choice. Not my first choice but he makes my top 5 list of managers I'd be happy to hear about joining.",Chelsea,Yes,jaj9lwz,t1_jaj80df
I didn‚Äôt say I wanted him to I just said I read that this is a possibility,Chelsea,Yes,jakatdr,t1_jak59zx
"I wasn‚Äôt saying the lineup is the same as the one we played, I‚Äôm saying the lineup they put out is maybe a couple players away from being a standard PL lineup for them. Almost everyone who started has a significant number of PL minutes. It‚Äôs not like they put out a team of kids",Chelsea,Yes,jalueap,t1_jakii86
"Did hazard look average? 

Mahrez would have been brilliant here. 

He‚Äôd work under both a counterattacking side and as part of the Sarri side later on",Chelsea,Yes,jahaosf,t1_jaha23g
Highly disagree,Chelsea,Yes,jahc9lb,t1_jaha23g
"Yep you are right. I honestly blanked on him. I'll change it to RLC is probably closes in profile who has actually been available recently. Basically, Kante is replacing RLC, Mount, and Gallagher in the past few months and can do things that none of them can do.",Chelsea,Yes,jaiedys,t1_jaicfmf
"You‚Äôre saying it takes time it didn‚Äôt take Eddie Howe any time at all to bring Newcastle from relegation battles to top 5. It also didn‚Äôt take graham potter anytime to bring chelsea from 4th in October to mid table in March. Boehly has made a string of errors in the short time he has been at the club. You have typed paragraphs and none of them is a good defense of the shit he‚Äôs been throwing at the wall

How is 15/16 relevant? That was sandwiched by two title winning seasons. Incomparable to our situation now 

Why are you talking about chelsea catching city? Who‚Äôs talking about a title race? We are looking up at brentford atm

The decline you are talking about before potter includes cup finals every season, top 4, and European champions outplaying all our opponents just 2 years ago. also was top of the league last year before Covid and injuries. Fast forward to now least goals scored in England top 4 tiers of football since November - that‚Äôs a decline",Chelsea,Yes,jakx2mh,t1_jakwree
They are brainless obviously,Chelsea,Yes,janhwkw,t1_jalyv92

">Rob Greene even came out with the stories of how the players literally revolted against the manager and his ideas.

Rob Green mostly tells stories to make himself sound important. Which is ironic given that his biggest achievement in football is being third choice goalkeeper for a Sarri side that won the EL.",Chelsea,Yes,jah9xop,t1_jah3bsx
Zidane is jobless why don‚Äôt we get him then?,Chelsea,Yes,jahc4bu,t1_jahbzqp

"Conte did a 43 point improvement from the season before.

We really should be aiming for 75 points plus next year.",Chelsea,Yes,jaifkhi,t1_jai38pp
I'm ambivalent on Potter tbh. I've accepted Todd probably not sacking him anytime soon.  I'm talking about the wisdom of new owners coming in and changing so much so fast. That's the conversation I'm trying to have. If you wanna just vent on Potter go do that with someone else.,Chelsea,Yes,jahuyx0,t1_jahtdt5
Did really well to set up the corner that ultimately killed us versus Dortmund. Excellent cross into the box and no one could the necessary power on it!,Chelsea,Yes,jak86so,t1_jak1nnf
"No way, man. Mudryk has been a complete ghost since Liverpool. Just check his stats ‚Äì he has 0.22 xG+xAG in his 5 PL appearances.

And he's probably been our worst player since Liverpool. That's not to say he's a bad player ‚Äì he has potential for days ‚Äì I just think he's *really* struggled so far.",Chelsea,Yes,jakbqqn,t1_jajvk4s
"I agree. The way these guys perform on the pitch, I feel it is quite apparent that they dont like him or dont want to play for him",Chelsea,Yes,jaghv1u,t1_jaghfyq

"Kompany started at Burnley, is doing well and will get to prove himself in the PL next season before probably going to a bigger club. The notion that someone has to start their career at a top club in order to be considered a top coach is retarded. There are many factors that go into considering someone a top level coach and it‚Äôs not just the club they are in charge of",Chelsea,Yes,jai0kw3,t1_jahxcbl
Ugarte over Kone as well?,Chelsea,Yes,jagwoht,t1_jagwjza
Exactly. Soton most likely won‚Äôt be in position to ask silly money,Chelsea,Yes,jagxwue,t1_jagx51t
so are we though,Chelsea,Yes,jah3s6j,t1_jagx51t
Ofcourse you don't care how bad Potter has been. Embarrassing.,Chelsea,Yes,jaguim0,t1_jagt5vp
"That‚Äôs fair enough, iirc he was one of the favourites when Mourinho came back and when Conte came in, and tbh that‚Äôs where my want for him to be our manager came from and it hasn‚Äôt really gone away.

If they‚Äôre giving all this time to Potter, surely someone with the cv Simeone has would get more than enough time to get it going.",Chelsea,Yes,jai9kuz,t1_jai8rn6
"I wasn‚Äôt correcting you or arguing, just wanted to emphasise that Poch would be a good manager for us.

"It's not about him, it's about we making every forwards we sign looking bang average.",Chelsea,Yes,jahcm8o,t1_jahaosf
Yeah I think some fortunes will turn if Kante is fit. But let's see. I think the midfield has been the big problem. As United have shown having some quality midfielders can level up the side.,Chelsea,Yes,jaigle0,t1_jaiedys
"Are you going to actually counter any of my points? Or just say the same things over and over? 

It‚Äôs that easy right? So, explain Leicester then. They were 17th the season before they won the prem. It‚Äôs that easy right? Where are they now? Why haven‚Äôt they been consistently top 4? 

Explain why Newcastle isn‚Äôt top 4 anymore and look like shit their past few games. Explain why Almiron isn‚Äôt scoring goals anymore. Explain why 70 m Isak isn‚Äôt ripping the league apart. Explain why Bruno is getting red cards. Explain why ASM is still a selfish, albeit talented, player? Why hasn‚Äôt Howe fixed all that?

You're conflating the point you are making with That top club having to be Chelsea. Let them play their way to the top then after 5-7 years at the top we can sign then. Signing half baked managers with no experience at this level is asking for a disaster. Case in point Potter.,Chelsea,Yes,jai2gdo,t1_jai0kw3

Eddie howe took them from bottom of the table to 5th in the space of 1 year you melon. A cup final reached as well. That‚Äôs a success for them. He has made Newcastle a competive side despite the lack of quality in the side. We‚Äôve lost more games in our last 3 than Newcastle has all season. Potter has done nearly the opposite. We are uncompetitive in all aspects. Boehly is responsible for such utter mismanagement. What part of that don‚Äôt you understand?,Chelsea,Yes,jakxqgu,t1_jakxmvk

Tuchel, Raul, or Pochettino. There is a little chance Zidane will back to Madrid considering he had disagreement over transfers with Perez during his first and second stint.",Chelsea,Yes,jahmzzw,t1_jahe1dz

"Matuidi always played in front of him or was a winger/wide midfielder, I watched pretty much every tournament game France played from 2016 to 2021.

Matuidi was pretty much never a DM for France.

Hopefully he continues to develop and hasnt reached his ceiling. He is a good player, but honestly we need great players.

"The sad part about EPL in general, is how the competition is so tight, that ref easily could put the thumbs on the scale to decide who to win the tittle

Obviously we pay more attentions to Liverpool. But remember how in 2013/14 Sterling was on side for like 2m for us and was still marked offside? Then last season City got bs pen from Wolves and I think Everton, when literally any drop points could dictate tittle?

When Ole joined United, the press loves him so much that they gave him like 10 penalties in like 20 games or something. Include goals when the ball was out of bound and after final whistle. Thank fk, Klopp publicly comment about it , and suddenly the extra number of penalties disappeared

Our season, we got winds behind our back for the 'Liverpool win tittle after 20 years' narrative too. Ngl, was benefited from decisions which they would have never given us normally.

This year, City still get their share of flavour. But they still get the worst call ever with that Rashford offside one. Meanswhile the only thing Arsenal has to complain about, is they don't get enough penalties. Fk they only won against us thank to Jesus nonpen was given

&#x200B;

Winning from bs decision breeds confidence. And confidence boost players winning more.

Lets be honest Jones was never that good. His only strength was that he was good on the ball. Baj on the other hand, tackles and has that directness like Gerrard and is composed like Busquets. I just hope next season he doesn't get the basement treatment. Hell I don't even want him to get loaned out.",Liverpool,Yes,jav9tez,t1_jav8kwe
The Bournemouth player laying on the floor for the first minute and a half of added time I‚Äôd imagine.,Liverpool,Yes,jawk591,t1_jawjv0r
The jealousy when we win is deep in the roots of rival fans. A day doesnt do by when those cunts cant think of us. Rent free in their heads,Liverpool,Yes,jawnwtp,t1_jawnkvv
"They had Usmanov for a long time, washing Putin's money for long enough.",Liverpool,Yes,jawq6li,t1_jawnkvv
The kid is 19. Paul Tomkins has done excellent work on how players improve exponentially upon hitting their 20s. He still has plenty of time to learn the defensive side of the game and become a great CM.,Liverpool,Yes,jav4soj,t1_jav2pqv
"He‚Äôs too young to make a prediction, really.

He‚Äôs not quite got the pace for the wing, and he‚Äôs too much of a liability defensively to play midfield. Hopefully one of those areas improve as he gets older, and he‚Äôll find his place.",Liverpool,Yes,jav4gay,t1_jav2pqv
Great potential but doesn't fit in a 433. Either we change the system in the future to a 4231 or he changes clubs. Same goes with Carvalho.,Liverpool,Yes,javbvhu,t1_jav2pqv
"People here totally have rose colored glasses on for this kid. If he was playing for Wolves I doubt there would be this much hype about him.

He's very one dimensional and relies too much on his left foot so his play is predictable. His passing/crossing and first touch need a lot of work. He lacks pace to play in the wings, lacks the physicality to play in midfield. People say that Xavi and Iniesta were all small but the gulf in technical ability between Elliot and those guys are galaxies apart. 

Unless something changes with his current rate of development, I'm not sure he will be a mainstay in our team by the time he's 23 where his attributes are not enough to mask his deficiencies.",Liverpool,Yes,javajx0,t1_jav2pqv
"Always get downvoted for saying it, but I don't think he fits the side. Not strong or defensive minded enough for midfield (we need midfielders who can snap into tackles etc) and not pacey or explosive or clinical enough to displace one of our forwards. We don't need bodies as depth any more (this may sound like I'm disparaging him but I'm not, he's a clever player but more of a 10), so he would be an obvious one for me to move on for a decent fee and more playing time at a midtable club. Mainly because I don't think the above is something that he just needs to grow into as he's young, it's just a fundamental issue with fit. On the other hand, Bajcetic is equally young but it's much easier to see a path for him into the first team or at least as strong depth for a key position. I just don't think Harvey has the toolkit to be either a mid or a forward in our preferred system, unless we start playing a diamond or something.",Liverpool,Yes,javb12m,t1_jav2pqv
"Honestly, I hope we go big and get proper mids in the summer - there are some really good options out there- Then I think it will matter less, and he can play a more niche role.

As for a winger option, I‚Äôd honestly prefer to see Doak get those minutes. It‚Äôs really the issue of pace and drive. 

Elliott could have a role but I want to see serious competition for those positions and whomever can push the needle gets the nod. He‚Äôs seems a great guy, exudes love for the club but I do have concerns about whether he makes us more elite or not, it doesn‚Äôt appear that way to me compared to other options in the market. We need to start dominating the middle of the park again, and I just don‚Äôt see it with him, now.",Liverpool,Yes,jav5zxv,t1_jav2pqv
"> but he is very one-footed 

As is Salah. Probably one of the most one-footed wingers I've ever seen. If you're good enough on that foot, it makes very little difference. 

Elliot's future isn't in midfield, it's in attack. He's a serviceable midfielder but he lacks the skillset to thrive there. He is much better running at defenders, dribbling and picking out final passes. 

For a 19-year-old, his understanding of the game is fantastic, and he's great technically, too. I think he's an important player for us in the next few years.",Liverpool,Yes,javecvd,t1_jav2pqv
"I think they are priming him to be our Bernard/David Silva, Foden type. Not especially explosive, but very incisive passing, excellent in half spaces, runs all day and is a natural for making runs in the box. Supreme technique.",Liverpool,Yes,javapc0,t1_jav2pqv
"I don't think there's a nice way of saying it...but if Harvey is a long-term starter I think it'll be indicative of poor recruitment. There will simply be players who can offer all Harvey can creatively whilst being far less limited.

He's still young and he obviously has decent potential, but the moments of magic are few and far between for a player of his attacking predisposition. He just doesn't offer enough on the ball to justify his weaknesses without it imo. 

After seeing Bajcetic in a few sub appearances I was already sure he was gonna make it (same with Doak tbf), I've just never really got that impression about Harvey. Long-term I see his level being more similar to Ox or Shaqiri than the world class player many seem to think he is.",Liverpool,Yes,javd4qy,t1_jav2pqv
"Super potential, and when we we're facing teams parking the bus he offered us something we were lacking by getting into the half space between the Midfield and Attack.

Unfortunately, letting him get forward more requires more solidity from the other two Midfielders and we've lacked that this year making them all look pretty bad. I think if they revamp the Midfield he becomes much more of an option as an attacking 8 again. 
Also after being taken out for a few weeks, he returned against Wolves and looked a lot better in the physical/defensive side of things. Maybe that was just because Wolves aren't amazing, or maybe it's something they've been working on with him recently. 

I'm a big fan and think he'll be a baller. Think it just depends on whether he can adapt enough to make a position in the 433 his own. Think he's be unreal in the 10, or on the right, if the 4231 was reintroduced.",Liverpool,Yes,javld6t,t1_jav2pqv
"The lad deserves a belter song, bit weird how some lads never end up getting one - always felt that Sturridge deserved a proper chant too.",Liverpool,Yes,jav4wur,t1_jav2pl2
[removed],Liverpool,Yes,jav86x5,t1_jav2pl2
I'd be surprised if they'd be willing to spend 120-150 million on a midfielder when their midfield is already world class. Even if it is united. If they decide to keep sabitzer their midfield would be sorted going into next season. They need a striker more than anything.,Liverpool,Yes,javi8cn,t1_javhk8c

Way too early to say imo. Our next run of games are insane,Liverpool,Yes,jawj1gi,t1_jawiu9m
"Helped them already at the start of the season when Gabriel had a clear arm ball, and Saka was offside for their goal but there ‚Äúwas no camera angle present‚Äù for the review. That was a huge momentum booster for them and a massive deflator for us",Liverpool,Yes,jawnqh3,t1_jawn6yf
Like most 'I want to save us from those at the top of the hierarchy' sentiments - They just wanted to replace those at the top with a noble angle on it.,Liverpool,Yes,javoddu,t1_javnmy2
"Yeah no such thing as this ""saving football"" bollocks. The plain simple truth is, every fan of their own club just wanted their own team to win. Simples. No need for people to get all philosophical about it.",Liverpool,Yes,javpg0j,t1_javnmy2

They are 5 points ahead having to go to city and anfield.,Liverpool,Yes,jawx2cg,t1_jawpd81
"Honestly Mane might have scored more goals but so often he did confusing things that made you scratch your head. 

Mane had this strange ability to spend 40 minutes doing things that made you say ""wtf Is his decision making this game"" and then bang a goal in that's world class just to give you whiplash. 

I absolutely loved him for that in a way it made him entertaining, and despite the confusion you never really were scared because you knew a goal would come from Mane, Salah or firmino at some point. 


Firmino though was just so god damn consistent. There was two or three seasons where I think he just didn't have a single game where he was off the boil. I can't remember him having a single bad game whilst he was in his prime. The level of consistency he brought whilst simultaneously being able to do silky plays is jaw dropping. It may not have grabbed attention like incredible goals do, but in its own way its as important and as beautiful",Liverpool,Yes,jav5f0h,t1_jav4sqi
Where has anyone actually said that?lol,Liverpool,Yes,javeuc7,t1_javef9x
"Curtis Jones is a good player, he's better than 99.9% of the World's population, but as a midfielder for a team that wants to win big trophies, he's not good enough. I can see him doing well for a good championship team, and maybe at a mid-table level. 

He had one good goal scored against Everton, and he's living off that. Great players are consistent, he's not.",Liverpool,Yes,javgyc4,t1_javef9x
Because they haven't seen Curtis play for a while and have forgotten how bad he is.,Liverpool,Yes,javf7wm,t1_javef9x
Call me delusional but I don't see why Elliott can't become a player like Gavi. He just needs to work on his defensive contributions more. That Wolves game showed that he can indeed put in some tackles and he already has that pressing intensity.,Liverpool,Yes,javerfa,t1_javef9x
"Unfortunately I don't think Curtis is good enough for us, hes a good player and a nice lad. But at Liverpool we should demand the best. He would be better off at a smaller club.",Liverpool,Yes,javet9c,t1_javef9x
"Jones just never kicked on unfortunately.

Imo Elliott has suffered playing time wise with the Midfield being so poor. Him as an 8 always struck me as moving towards a more attacking midfield. Unfortunately that only works when the two next to him are playing well defensively.

I think him being dropped for more defensive minded options in Midfield led to reactionary fans thinking it was too do with his form and not the necessity of the team to be more defensively solid.",Liverpool,Yes,javj1ax,t1_javef9x
"If it weren't for the HG slots I think both should probably move on tbh. Don't think either are good enough for us long term. Curtis is definitely nowhere near the standard.

I've also seen almost no one say bin Eliot keep Curtis btw",Liverpool,Yes,javsb81,t1_javef9x

"The thing is Mo relies heavily on his pace and that will inevitably decrease as he gets older (he‚Äôs already clearly gotten slower) Messi, Lewa and Ronaldo never relied on their pace hence why they were able to stay at a high level well into their 30‚Äôs. Ronaldo did rely on his pace to an extent but his brilliant shooting and the ability to be amazing in the air allowed him to become more of a poacher.

"I actually think Spurs have gone under the radar as our biggest rivals for top 4

It‚Äôs pretty much been all spurs not really done much,Liverpool,Yes,jawc5u2,t1_jawafg4
Lots of rumours we are getting him,Liverpool,Yes,jawbl0f,t1_jawbaz9
"No, it's hilarious watching watching him fail again.",Liverpool,Yes,jay2j6n,t1_jaxz93t
"Sacked, back to everton so he can be with them when they finally  get relegated.  Dyche to West Ham to get them a 15-16th place finish.",Liverpool,Yes,jaynf90,t1_jaxz93t
Can't stand the constant talk of the f-ing quadruple for them.,Liverpool,Yes,jayddf2,t1_jaxv52v
"We kickstarted their season by letting them beat us at Old Trafford, now it's our turn to bring a stop to that nonsense.",Liverpool,Yes,jaz0kdg,t1_jaxv52v
They already spent 100m combine in Isak and Gordon,Liverpool,Yes,javrcbr,t1_javpypy
Don't really care about the Arsenal bit. Them losing doesn't give us anything,Liverpool,Yes,jawqo3a,t1_jawkii5
"Agreed, it was the same when they played against United, dominated the second half. Bit rich to call it luck when we did it countless times in our 97 and 99 point seasons.",Liverpool,Yes,jawpytr,t1_jawjor3
"Still another 12 games for them to go, including going away to City and away to us.

A lot of Football for them to still play.",Liverpool,Yes,jawkrfj,t1_jawjor3
Bournemouth at fault mate. Laid on the floor for the first 2 mins of added time.,Liverpool,Yes,jawkhz9,t1_jawk00n
"""They have been training with me dos, tres, cuatro times""

David William Moyes",Liverpool,Yes,javkx7y,t1_javkq3c
Getting into the top four is vital and City isn't really a major rival. I will support them unreservedly.,Liverpool,Yes,javkt1a,t1_javkkj7
"It's envy, Arsenal are getting all the luck we perceive ourselves of lacking in previous seasons. 

Ironically other teams probably thought of us in a similar light before",Liverpool,Yes,jawnhsv,t1_jawmrn6
This is such a weird reaction. We desperately need midfielders in the summer ‚Äì with one being a defensive midfielder. Why are you happy that one of the top defensive midfielder targets is now off the market? That just means more competition for the remaining targets.,Liverpool,Yes,javbtnd,t1_javak8a
The contract has no release clause according to Brighton tier 1 journo,Liverpool,Yes,jav957o,t1_jav5etd
At least we have won it all recently. Would be tragic to be this close and not get any trophies the past few years,Liverpool,Yes,jaxepnc,t1_jaxbgdw
but we know we've been shit,Liverpool,Yes,javzz57,t1_javxt64
"Once Rashford or Casemiro dip in form/get injured it's over for them, they've been genuinely amazing for them so far. I see Arsenal as more of a team effort, injuries can't break them, if Saka is out of form even Nelson can score",Liverpool,Yes,jawl2b0,t1_jawkq3r
"You'd hurt yourself. Last I checked, robots are made of metal.",Liverpool,Yes,javwa0u,t1_javw5vc
I'm sure Jude will want the iconic 8,Liverpool,Yes,javhw9f,t1_javhplq
"We have way too many nice guys in the team now, we need more Robertsons in the starting 11",Liverpool,Yes,jawpm3u,t1_jawl46n
"Not just handballs... even random shots that should be a goal kick they were complaining that it should be a corner

Even complain about throw ins to Bournemouth , free kicks, everything

Arteta must know it works as he keeps leading the protests literally every single time",Liverpool,Yes,jawphyx,t1_jawlkta
[deleted],Liverpool,Yes,javz28c,t1_javxf1y
Is orange,Liverpool,No,jawc03y,t1_jawbt34
"So they don't have a proper RB, much less an attacking one. Ouch.",Liverpool,No,jawc8u3,t1_jawbt34
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin) I think I'll join you digitally,Liverpool,Yes,jawmb8q,t1_jawj528
Fekir had the Liverpool kit on at one point and still didn't happen,Liverpool,Yes,jax0b9f,t1_jawyfk9
What changed the course of Werner‚Äôs transfer to LFC? I think he could have been better with us than he was at Chelsea but still really glad that one didn‚Äôt work out.,Liverpool,Yes,jaxcrt6,t1_jawyfk9
"Himself, Mane and Salah would have been a big fuckin problem, imagine that press",Liverpool,Yes,javxmgk,t1_javxd5h
"Completely subjective, other fans hate Robbo because he winds people up",Liverpool,Yes,javy13e,t1_javxrfb
Never heard of him honestly,Liverpool,Yes,javxtza,t1_javxnlm
That's not happening imo,Liverpool,Yes,javxut0,t1_javxphk
One of Jones' biggest strengths was that he was scouse. We so wanted a Gerrard 2.0 we tried to will it into becoming reality. Had that screamer against everton and is okay but is clear he is not 'generational'. A squad player at best.,Liverpool,Yes,javc6f9,t1_jav9tez
"Was he down for a minute and a half ? Felt like less 
Fair enough so",Liverpool,Yes,jawl0ju,t1_jawk591
"Yeah, to justify a long-term place in a side which wants to push for trophies you really need to be top class to justify such a key role in the team.

At the bare minimum I reckon he'd need to become on par with a player like (LFC) Coutinho and i'm just not seeing it. And as somebody else has mentioned even when Coutinho left it was a net benefit to the side.

If we let Elliott's potential enter our minds when it comes to long-term first XI planning then it'll be to our own detriment.",Liverpool,Yes,jaw0rf8,t1_javajx0
When we had a genuine world class player in that role of attacking 8 playmaker cutting in on their strong foot (Coutinho) and we still got better when we sold him partially from gaining more defensive solidity in the midfield. Let alone a half decent but nothing incredible young prospect who can't run. He just doesn't work in our set up and he isn't good enough to justify working the team around for him.,Liverpool,Yes,javppuy,t1_javb12m
"This is exactly how I feel, you just worded it much better",Liverpool,Yes,javaiu1,t1_jav5zxv
"Why are you comparing harvey to salah,

In midfield you can't be as one footed as harvey is, he really needs to work on that, you can't get around it unless you are messi or salah, completely different posisitons to playing as a number 8 in midfield anyway.

Unless you are messi or salah yeah, but why are you using these players as a yard stick?

It doesnt matter as much playing as a winger sure, but in midfield you can't be as one footed as harvey.",Liverpool,Yes,javiqzn,t1_javecvd
"He's still too one-footed and lacks the physicality to be a top attacker, in our system our forwards need to be lethal and Harvey just ain't it. Can people honestly say that they'd be happy for Elliott to be Salah's successor in the first XI?

Even when it comes to fellow youngsters, the eyeball test between him and a player like Doak is night and day in that position.",Liverpool,Yes,javyyz5,t1_javecvd
I think so too....I just don't think Elliott is of the level required to become world class there and we can't afford to settle for anything less in the current PL climate.,Liverpool,Yes,jaw085o,t1_javapc0
"All of those guys are in a different league in terms of technique and skill even at the same age. Elliott isn't even as skillful as someone like shaqiri who was never more than a backup for us.  This is not even mentioning the complete absence of pace and physicality (those you mentioned are much quicker and stronger also), and he has no right foot at all.

He has good vision and decision making but he's just not someone who is ever going to be a key player for a team challenging for titles.",Liverpool,Yes,javp6hh,t1_javapc0
I fucking love belting that out man. Its so awful its just brilliant.,Liverpool,Yes,javcjir,t1_jav86x5
They have one world class midfielder in the twilight of his career.,Liverpool,Yes,javn1z8,t1_javi8cn
"Casemiro has 1 or 2 seasons before the inevitable DM drop off, Fred is 29 and has been elevated by Casemiro, Bruno turns 29 this year and hasn't been consistent since the covid season 

Eriksen looks like he's truly on the wane at 31, and no one has any idea how Sabitzer would look in their team. That then leaves Scooby Doo McTominay and the ghost of van de beek 

Not only would I not say a Casemiro-Fred-Bruno midfield is world class (they're 3rd), they've definitely bought for ""now"" in mind, probably to ease Ten hag in, and this will be their ceiling, like us in 2019. They definitely will be on the lookout for fresh blood if they want to get competitive for the trophies that matter",Liverpool,Yes,javksa7,t1_javi8cn
"The issue is, if they want to, they can spend ¬£120m.",Liverpool,Yes,javim7q,t1_javi8cn
"city ""fans"" being paid actors is my favourite stupid conspiracy theory that i'm totally willing to believe in",Liverpool,Yes,javrsne,t1_javrgx0
The sound of my thumb hitting the screen is generating more sound than that stadium,Liverpool,Yes,javrq85,t1_javrgx0
"Expand stadium.

Accounts with links to owner buy the available tickets.

Ticket holder doesn't attend game as they are in Abu Dhabi.

Receive clean money to spend.",Liverpool,Yes,javrogf,t1_javr51g
it‚Äòs just for pumping more money into the club as revenue. they‚Äòll just buy all the extra tickets every game.,Liverpool,Yes,javrj1b,t1_javr51g
"Like imagine if we can sack ref every time they fk us over. 

But yeah that the sort of things referee have to face now. Fk other clubs and that fk Webb will come out to defend you. Fk Arsenal over, and they have to publicly apologise, and even referee may face the sack",Liverpool,Yes,jawo7me,t1_jawngck
"Yeah. That's a valid reason for punishment. How many refs were punished for the Pickford murder attempt? Oh, zwro? Hm. Guess Liverpool's players didn't nag enough at the ref.",Liverpool,Yes,jawokz6,t1_jawngck
It was said when we went through a rough patch during January. The scapegoating against Elliott was massive back then,Liverpool,Yes,javezot,t1_javeuc7
Barca are in trouble again in the summer they need to sell,Liverpool,Yes,jaw02kr,t1_javzndt
*[Laughs at Arsenal]*,Liverpool,Yes,jawdt76,t1_jawdn6u
"burn has been solid at left back, they have not conceded many this season, he's solid at the back",Liverpool,Yes,javr5e2,t1_javq1ov
"might be, i have to agree.",Liverpool,Yes,javpoza,t1_javpnga
"Fuck that, real club every time",Liverpool,Yes,jaw96vr,t1_jaw8sx6
"I'm agreeing with this. City winning is like ""meh"".  I respect Arsenal as a club, but on the other hand I can take joy in seeing their fans missing out on a title.",Liverpool,Yes,jawb5w8,t1_jaw8sx6
"With a game in hand, a win turns it into 8 points, which has been caught up from this position",Liverpool,Yes,jaw7xv3,t1_jaw7sgv
"Yeah i don't see him losing his legs overnight like many others, he takes too good a care of himself.

Even when he does, he'll still be a very good striker.",Liverpool,Yes,javhfxq,t1_javfo34
">I actually think Spurs have gone under the radar as our biggest rivals for top 4

Spurs have an easier fixture list looking at theirs compared to ours, that's our problem the way I look at it.

Means we have to beat them at Anfield.",Liverpool,Yes,javpvy8,t1_javolay
"Probably not a we thing, more of a me thing.  Plus a high score line would put them (Soton) above Everton which is more what I was referring to.",Liverpool,Yes,jax0kpb,t1_jawy5rs
If we want one team to go down is West Ham to snatch Rice or something.,Liverpool,Yes,jaxfm2u,t1_jawz3ce
"Leicester's owners make most of their money from Duty Free shopping, mainly in Bangkok. Covid absolutley ruined tourism. And even though Thailand re-opened pretty early, most of their consumers had been Chinese tourists. China only started letting people travel for pleasure in January. So for 3 years they had very little revenue, hence the lack of spending and no money to tell B Rodge to F Off. Which IIFC would be 15-20 million.",Liverpool,Yes,jay1whq,t1_jawvsh8
"I‚Äôm backing us for top 4 and to beat them. 
We never win at etihad so I think that will be a draw . I fancy us with jota and Bobby vs Arsenal they always score. 
I see city beating Arsenal there so they lose by one point or two 
They have the Toon away too
Not backing anyone just know the tiny margins and see it costing them",Liverpool,Yes,jawll68,t1_jawlcqv
Isn‚Äôt he like 38 or something?,Liverpool,Yes,jaww8js,t1_jaww1ix
He's probably going to be an inside forward like Mane was.,Liverpool,Yes,jaw3qut,t1_jaw38ay
That's not my point. The nonsense comments about them being lucky etc.... I love nothing more than a late winner!,Liverpool,Yes,jaxbnau,t1_jawuw3h
His technical abilities are amazing.,Liverpool,Yes,javqwz6,t1_javqnzp
He's also deceptively strong. He looks like a twig but uses his body extremely well.,Liverpool,Yes,javwewn,t1_javqnzp
"I love Nunez, but he does not create his goals. All his goals have come from assists, nothing wrong with that. But he is not that kind of player.",Liverpool,Yes,javsxj3,t1_javsd1p
That and the 'injury' team talk at 65 mins each and every fucking game.,Liverpool,Yes,jawpxsg,t1_jawp3x8
"It's a joke about all the times basically every neutral wanted City to win instead of us.

Oil state cheating > ""unbearable Scousers"" doing it fairly, apparently.

So yeah I don't really care but see the logic in Oil state cheating > Lego man fairly.",Liverpool,Yes,javj42a,t1_javgtcc
"He most likely will ofc, but he's not been at a 0.5 goals per game ratio since the new year",Liverpool,Yes,javvrad,t1_javvdae
"Well such a stance only strengthens their negotiating hand, i'd be very surprised if they don't entertain negotiations if a club wants to break the ¬£100m barrier and Gvardiol asks to leave.",Liverpool,Yes,jawh2t4,t1_jawgoqh
Yeah we could do with a singing section. No drums though; for me they just make the atmosphere seem forced and unnatural.,Liverpool,Yes,jaz03b6,t1_jawcjae
"The Mirror aren't even the direct source, they say that it's something ""CalcioMercato"" are saying.",Liverpool,Yes,jauyibl,t1_jauu9lq
I think he can be a long term replacement of Salah. I love Jota but maybe he can be part of a swap deal.,Liverpool,Yes,jav5cbi,t1_jauvomj
"My guy was working in Primark or something 10yrs ago, maybe his idea of a good wage is more relative?",Liverpool,Yes,javl07g,t1_javkavc
yeah we are guessing Douglas Luiz at that time. Arthur's loan was a huge surprise,Liverpool,Yes,javjg8h,t1_javildz
[deleted],Liverpool,Yes,jawtxi3,t1_jawse1m
"true, we got like 200 left wingers now haha",Liverpool,Yes,jawb268,t1_jawaziv
"Are you enjoying it now?

Will this game even matter to you if we don't beat United tomorrow? Arsenal schadenfreude is such a lame cope",Liverpool,Yes,jawg68j,t1_jawfupd
We signed 3 LW and only one plays LW. Jota and Gakpo both for CF roles,Liverpool,Yes,javl3t0,t1_jav6pan
"He's a midfielder. We are losing at least 3 this summer. Need bodies, they can't all be Jude Bellingham",Liverpool,Yes,jawoxfi,t1_jawmr60
"Both, to be fair. You still have to finish that.",Liverpool,Yes,jaw6gh5,t1_jaw6d9y
Yeah it kind of feels with them getting him they are expecting him to go but it‚Äôs Chelsea and that would be giving them too much credit,Liverpool,Yes,jawbyxf,t1_jawbl0f
"Is he our plan to fix that RM spot? He's a tad more competitive physically than Elliott, but a long way from what we need there.",Liverpool,Yes,jawcky2,t1_jawbl0f
Rookie numbers,Liverpool,Yes,javrf6z,t1_javrcbr
"I'm not happy he's offf the market he would be have been a good buy. What I'm sick of hearing is every podcast or transfer thread repeatedly mentioning him (along with others we all know). It's just repetitive and tiresome. Sure if we REALLY wanted him and he wanted to come here he wouldn't have signed contract. 

So let's just move on",Liverpool,Yes,javc28j,t1_javbtnd
We have a trophy for THIS YEAR already. The disrespect for the vaunted community shield  üõ° üò§,Liverpool,Yes,jaxklhe,t1_jaxepnc
"I am not complaining. Been by far the most successful period of my lifetime and for me personally I wouldn't want to be state owned and financially doping our way to trophies.

Just merely stating that coming so close as much as we have is heartbreaking. The slip in 13/14 was the hardest to take because that season was the most fun I've had as a fan and it was such a cruel way to lose it.",Liverpool,Yes,jaxq1ke,t1_jaxepnc
"Agreed, but also feel like this is Arsenal's only chance this season. They're not making easy work of it and we know those effort levels aren't sustainable. I think they'll have a big drop off next season like we had in 2014-15",Liverpool,Yes,jawmhud,t1_jawl2b0
"IIRC the reason he likes the number 22 so much is because it shows his ability to ‚Äòdo it all‚Äô so he likes it because it shows his ability to play as a 4,8 or 10",Liverpool,Yes,javj544,t1_javhw9f
That court case is going to take years. I very much doubt that.,Liverpool,Yes,javzemu,t1_javz28c
They don't really use traditional full backs in their system. It's by design. Both of their full backs play inverted.,Liverpool,Yes,jawcdzt,t1_jawc8u3
"That was during a window, though. Werner was outside a window, from a winter, heading into a summer.",Liverpool,Yes,jax77et,t1_jax0b9f
It‚Äôs totally understandable why it didn‚Äôt his agent was trying to change things at the last second,Liverpool,Yes,jax2xyb,t1_jax0b9f
"It was said it was Covid. He had a release clause and we were not ready to pay it in one shot because of the economic uncertainty. We then bought Jota, where we could pay Wolves in installments.",Liverpool,Yes,jaxhs8w,t1_jaxcrt6
Chelsea gave him like 250k/300k in wages,Liverpool,Yes,jaxxckf,t1_jaxcrt6
Nah they're very different. Silva is a proper cunt,Liverpool,Yes,javyme7,t1_javy13e
"Plays with Lorient in Ligue 1, kind of a break out season for him so he's not that well known.",Liverpool,Yes,javyux8,t1_javxtza
Too soon to tell tbh. Elliott is still just 19.,Liverpool,Yes,javy5kt,t1_javxut0
Nobody has ever thought he would be in any way shape or form Gerrard 2.0‚Ä¶..,Liverpool,Yes,javeo4t,t1_javc6f9
A 22 year old kid shouldn't be a squad player though. He should be loaned out to get as much minutes as he can.,Liverpool,Yes,javcrzk,t1_javc6f9
Almost exactly,Liverpool,Yes,jawl2gz,t1_jawl0ju
"Absolutely agree - and Coutinho brought goals too at his best. I wouldn't say Elliot 'can't run' tbh, but I don't see him as a particularly amazing passer (whereas Coutinho had a wicked eye for a pass even at 20) and isn't someone who'll change a game like Coutinho could at all.",Liverpool,Yes,javqn1z,t1_javppuy
"I'm comparing them because, *as my comment literally says*, Elliot's future isn't in midfield. He's being used there as a stopgap.",Liverpool,Yes,javk7nf,t1_javiqzn
"It's way too early to write anyone off at 19. Gerrard, famously, was told he was too physically inadequate at a young age and spent time developing to ensure he was the right bulk for the PL. 

Elliot has a *long* time to improve all weak areas of his game. Seeing nonsense like this just highlights to me how people here expect young players breaking through like Mbappe & Foden are the rule rather than the exception.",Liverpool,Yes,javzidd,t1_javyyz5
"I didn't know that it was a theory, but I'm also fully on board with it",Liverpool,Yes,javs31r,t1_javrsne
"Haha but in all seriousness, nobody is talking about how City are clearly inflating attendance figures to boost revenues with years",Liverpool,Yes,javrxsn,t1_javrq85
"No it wasn‚Äôt, stop talking bollocks‚Ä¶",Liverpool,Yes,javf465,t1_javezot
His 1 v 1 defending is extremely poor. Obviously he has other strengths but if you run at him he's a joke.,Liverpool,Yes,javtkrs,t1_javr5e2
"That‚Äôs exactly it, because its a real club it would suck more for me. I don‚Äôt want anyone other than Liverpool to be successful. I can brush off City winning it. Either way any club other than Liverpool sucks. A pick your poison thing",Liverpool,Yes,jawbymk,t1_jaw96vr
"So, would you prefer ManU win or ManCity? Cause ManU is a ""real"" club, I suppose?",Liverpool,Yes,jawehch,t1_jaw96vr
Hell yeah,Liverpool,Yes,jawc015,t1_jawb5w8
"yeah, our next 5 are unbelievably tough. Will decide a lot.",Liverpool,Yes,javrmvz,t1_javpvy8
I realise it was probably to do with Everton now,Liverpool,Yes,jax6y3f,t1_jax0kpb
Arsenal are going to drop more points than that. They have a tough schedule. Fulham away is next.,Liverpool,Yes,jawmcw2,t1_jawll68
36,Liverpool,Yes,jawwhk3,t1_jaww8js
36,Liverpool,Yes,jawwgl6,t1_jaww8js
"True, but Nunez is a completly different player so i have no idea why they compare the two. Against wolves he was playing left back, winger, cdm and attacker. Haaland can be completly invisible if hes not fed balls by his teammates.",Liverpool,Yes,javu8pr,t1_javsxj3
Haaland at City doesn't create his own either he's a poacher for them basically.,Liverpool,Yes,javzkqk,t1_javsxj3
Do you see haaland doing the run Nunez made vs wolves where he chipped it past a player and exploded with pace down the line?,Liverpool,Yes,javvylk,t1_javsxj3
They huddle every 10 mins like an nfl team,Liverpool,Yes,jawte1z,t1_jawpxsg
Which is Italian Mirror basically üòÇ,Liverpool,Yes,jauyot4,t1_jauyibl
Pretty good match to be fair thanks for asking. Liverpool being shite doesn't mean I can't slag other teams. What retarded mental gymnastics is this,Liverpool,Yes,jawgtqj,t1_jawg68j
"Not as easy as it looked, Bournemouth players ain't exactly Firmino level",Liverpool,Yes,jaw6vbm,t1_jaw6gh5
"Don't really have an opinion here, but just putting it out there that a lot of South American prospects if they're about to move to Europe, they sign a new contract to make sure their old club's getting something decent out of it.",Liverpool,Yes,javjl51,t1_javc28j
"yeah ill never get over 13/14 with stevie's chance to go out with the title.

i do feel a little grumpy about city's financial doping keeping us from an even more incredible period and have to wonder if one or two signings would have made the difference for us, but it would be MUCH worse without having won the lot along the way",Liverpool,Yes,jaxx3sv,t1_jaxq1ke
He's a good footballer but doesn't have the same aggressive tenacity to be able to play centre mid in the way Silva does,Liverpool,Yes,javyf0q,t1_javy5kt
How new are you to football?,Liverpool,Yes,javemss,t1_javcrzk
"Fine, but only the best players ever can be so one footed, so my comment is still valid.

Harvey will not be salah, messi, robben tier winger, lets be honest.",Liverpool,Yes,javko81,t1_javk7nf
"Your above statement could be used to invalidate any doubts shown towards any youngster ""what do you mean David N'Gog isn't gonna be the next Torres? Nonsense, he's only 19!""

If it's okay to hype up youngsters then it should also be okay to be critical, such is the way on a football discussion forum.",Liverpool,Yes,jaw2j67,t1_javzidd
"Yep, i've never met a City fan IRL, I'm convinced they're fictional.

I live near Leeds, Leeds fans and Man United fans and Liverpool fans are fucking everywhere....even the odd Chelsea or Arsenal fan but City fans? Not one.",Liverpool,Yes,javsb0t,t1_javs31r
What bollocks? Even Salah was shit on during that period,Liverpool,Yes,javfrvn,t1_javf465
He does get a lot of undeserved criticism,Liverpool,Yes,javgao1,t1_javf465
"It was. Haven't seen anyone say sell him specifically but definitely seem a lot say he has no future at the club. 

Mostly after being shoehorned into LW. It's crazy considering he's 19 and already a solid player in the squad.",Liverpool,Yes,javiago,t1_javf465
Fuck you,Liverpool,Yes,jawnlgc,t1_jawehch
"April 1st to April 9th is City away, Chelsea away and Arsenal at home then we still have another 4 PL games to play in April alone.",Liverpool,Yes,javtdmt,t1_javrmvz
"Watch his goals at Dortmund, explosive goals, with him sprinting with the ball. City‚Äôs style of play has really hindered his explosiveness, but he‚Äôs still scored 25+ goals.",Liverpool,Yes,javwhoz,t1_javvylk
What are we slagging them off for again?,Liverpool,Yes,jawjnok,t1_jawgtqj
"To be honest, pre Klopp I would have bit your hand off for an fa cup win and a top 4 finish. They wouldn't have even had to have been in the same season.

For basically my whole life we have been a cup team (we won the league when I was 1). I don't think a worse team will ever win the champions league than the 05 team. If you did a combined 11 with 2019 winning squad it's basically just the 19 squad. Gerrard gets in, possibly Carragher. I think people would argue for Alonso but he wasn't the player he went on to become later in his career.",Liverpool,Yes,jay06zp,t1_jaxx3sv
"Jesus fucking christ man, theres always this one guy trying to be a smartass and provoke other people. Imagine thinking theres anything wrong with saying a 22 yr old should be getting as much game time as possible.",Liverpool,Yes,javf6yc,t1_javemss
"He's also nowhere near as good as any of our forwards, so the guy's point is moot in that he'll never be 'an important player in our attack'. Wouldn't get a sniff ahead of Diaz or even Gakpo.",Liverpool,Yes,javvsj5,t1_javko81
"Yeah, as a forward he really doesn't seem to be anywhere near that band but it's taboo to say so...people will just say ""he's young"" ad infinitum.",Liverpool,Yes,javymej,t1_javko81
"Your argument embodies just how intensely football fans scrutinise young players. Here you are, desperate to point out that Elliot won't be good enough for Liverpool in the future, despite him being a teenager with his best footballing years well ahead of him. No wonder young English talents become disillusioned so easily; they've only got to glimpse at social media to see thousands of middle-aged adults slinging their dismissive opinions around every single hour.

No one can definitively say how Elliot will turn out but, for a 19-year-old playing out of position in a team distinctly lacking confidence, I think he's doing a fantastic job.",Liverpool,Yes,jaww2bh,t1_jaw2j67
I have to admit there are a few City fans who are aged in their 50s in my local town in the south east of Ireland. I'm convinced that they are just contrarians who had to support the opposite team to their brother or uncle or whatever,Liverpool,Yes,javsums,t1_javsb0t
"Show me a single comment let alone many of people actually suggest Elliot being sold.

People were rightly criticising because in midfield he‚Äôs not great, but certainly improving.

I‚Äôve been here and not seen that typed even once, maybe at best you see a rogue idiot but to suggest it was ‚Äúmany fans‚Äù is bollocks.",Liverpool,Yes,javg55n,t1_javfrvn
"He gets a lot of deserved criticism too but come on mate did you see fans clamouring for him to be sold?lol

The lads talking waffle",Liverpool,Yes,javgclx,t1_javgao1

And you think it's healthier in the long-term to overhype youngsters from a young age? It's at the point where suggesting he isn't the next Iniesta or David Silva is met with defensiveness.

"So, in your mind, it's better to write them off and doubt their ability instead? How odd. I've never said Elliot could be the next Salah in our team, I've simply said his future lies in the attack and his one-footedness won't hinder his performances because other players have shown that you don't need to use both feet equally to be amongst the best. I'm not saying he's the next Messi, but I am saying he looks far better when used in an attacking way rather than in midfield (where, actually, he's still showing his ability & desire even though it's not his natural position and he's working within a very dysfunctional midfield).",Liverpool,Yes,jaxbf0n,t1_jawz6gu

Asking a facetious question you know the answer to already,Liverpool,Yes,jawnbvl,t1_jawmoca
"He's better in attacking roles for sure, but to justify a starting place in those roles long-term...you need to be of such a high level that its difficult to see Elliott reaching it given his physical limitations. 

I think his best position is probably similar to Coutinho's role at LFC, but it'd be optimistic to think Elliott can reach that level and then force us into a tactical shift to accommodate him. 

Think it's best to control expectations, if he becomes a world class player then great, but we should not plan for it and not allow it to effect recruitment",Liverpool,Yes,jaxf3ij,t1_jaxbf0n

"I have grown up to the ripe old age of 31 and watched Liverpool my entire life, for the most part that was alongside my old man who passed away two years ago last week.

After all his years of watching them - many, many before I was even born - he always used to crack on to me about how Firmino was up there with the best he's watched (although wished he'd stopped getting his teeth done!)

It feels like the end of an era in more ways than one. I absolutely fucking love Bobby. With every player that leaves we move one step closer to a squad full of lads who my dad never got to see pull on the jersey and that makes me feel extremely empty.

Anyway, I know he'll get the send off he deserves. Hope he gets whatever he wants from his next move, gave me many years of joy and some incredible memories.",Liverpool,No,jasqae6,t3_11gszr9

It would take some of the pressure off of having to get new midfielders too. We've got Bajcetic, Fabinho, Henderson and Thiago for the positions behind them. I wouldn't want to rely on those offcourse, so 2 in would be required I'd guess. Maybe one out too. Then next summer shift someone again for a new player.

"Just rewatched the highlights from that wolves game. 

At the time I was a bit annoyed at Tierney but now after watching it again I'm four times as annoyed. That Fabinho yellow was even more ridiculous than I remembered it, and it's so blatantly obvious jota got pushed now being able to watch it again. 

But what pisses me off more is how blatantly commenters and broadcasters try and hide dumb decisions. Like initially when fabinho gets tackled they're talking about how it's dangerous play from the wolves player, and then the moment they realise its actually Fab getting booked they just transition to ""oh it's a difficult call"" when moments before they where acting like it was a clear foul on Fab. 

Then the jota goal the commenter deliberately don't comment on the push on jota and in fact none of the replays even really show it during the game, but it's clear as day on the highlights later. 

It just feels as though Tierney clearly is biased against liverpool. I don't think the broadcasters are particularly biased against liverpool but at the same time they're so desperate to defend referees at the moment that they end up defending clearly wrong decisions, either genuine mistakes or bias. 

Like we get it refs get a lot of stick and a fair bit of it is undeserved. But by defending referees when they blatantly fuck up you make it impossible to defend referees when they're getting unwarranted stick.

However, given his age, you expect that in a couple of years, when the Ten Hag project will peak and they will be expected to be challenging on all fronts, Casemiro will be in decline and they‚Äôll have to find a replacement.

"Klopp has to get this game tactically right and not give acres of space for the likes of Rashford to exploit by playing a high line. 

We have to dig in and play on the counter attack like we did against Man city to get the win. Too many casual fans seem to think Ten Haag is some tactical genius and Klopp is a novice when it comes to tactics. We have to surprise them and make use of Nunez's pace on the wings, this is where we can take advantage of their weakness. AWB isn't a great defender 1 vs 1 and if you give Nunez some space to get his touch right, he can leave him behind eating dust, same for Rashford vs Trent. 

Klopp has to get the team selection spot on. I wouldn't be opposed to bringing Bobby back for this game and instructing him to sit on Casemiro like he has done against Rodri before. 

If not Bobby I would start Gakpo and tell him to do the same. Start Bajcetic and fabinho in midfield and bring Henderson back in the lineup instead of Elliot, the game can be won on the wings instead of midfield.

If we‚Äôre going to persist with an attacker like Elliott in midfield, even though it‚Äôs obvious he‚Äôs not as effective there, why not slot Gakpo into that position with Nunez up top and Diaz left? (Obviously dependent on form, though if he gets anywhere near his pre-injury form then he walks into the team). 

Gakpo is showing promise as a false 9 in the last few games, and he‚Äôs becoming really good at holding the ball up and progressing it either through his passing or through holding and carrying the ball forward. 

At the very least I think he‚Äôd be a better option than Harvey‚Ä¶who I‚Äôm not knocking btw, he‚Äôs obviously brilliant but I feel he‚Äôs being wasted in that midfield position. I‚Äôd rather have him as a backup to Mo.

Firmino leaving is a shame for us. I think there really would have been no downsides to a short term renewal. Now he's going to go and we're likely not going to replace him because we already have 5 forwards.

"It would be very good midfield with massive potential

All of them work hard off the ball, all very good physcially but even the technical apsects of their game are very high already.

Ugarte and Kone are very press resistant as well as Bellingham, Jude is a 10+  goal a season CM at 19  so there  would be end product coming from the midfield for the first time under Klopp since Coutinho but without any sacrifice in defensive stability due to Bellingham being so well rounded.",Liverpool,Yes,jarfvha,t1_jaqqmlf
The difference they both make on the team is staggering also.,Liverpool,Yes,jaqhmun,t1_jaqg2ra
I don't think sitting back and playing like that works against a team that just have to not lose 4-0 tbh. We need to be right into them from the get go like we did against Barca. If Diaz is back for then we can defo press from the front. But our midfield will more than likely hold us back like it has all season.,Liverpool,Yes,jaqp316,t1_jaqnsoh

"Ox and Keita were just hard to  sell  due to them constantly being injured and their reasonably high wages, no club is going to pay a transfer fee plus 100k+ in wage for players that are never fit.

Bobby kind of similar but he's also in his 30s now and Milner is Milner.

Its also becoming increasingly common for players to run  down  their contracts because  they know that when a club gets them on a free they will get a bigger signing fee and higher wages most likely",Liverpool,Yes,jarelwu,t1_jarbw3x
"It's where we've gone wrong though and been too sentimental. 

Keita, Ox and Milner should of been sold years ago. It's nothing new in recent times though. Wijnaldum, Origi, Lallana, Clyne, Sturridge, Moreno, Emre Can all left for free in the last few years. And whilst people will say we wouldn't of been able to sell them anyway etc..

All of them except Sturridge are either playing week in week out for a PL team or a top 5 European league team that are in european competitions.

The 4 players leaving this summer should all be leaving. And I just hope that the fact we haven't given Bobby a new contract it's us moving on from this stupid sentimental bullshit era.",Liverpool,Yes,jargu1f,t1_jarbw3x
"Which is why it's crucial we move Matip and Fabinho this summer. They're slowly becoming deadwood and it'll be much harder to sell them as time goes by.

Thiago is an interesting case because his contract ends in 2024. He's good enough that you'd want to keep him for next season, but he's too old and injury prone for another contract extension.",Liverpool,Yes,jardozw,t1_jarbw3x

We've had one good performance against Wolves after 2 awful performances against Real and Palace. So even if their form is over rated, it's still far better than ours.

"It depends on funds. If we don't have enough id rather invest all in midfield (if thats even possible is another story) if we have more funds, we should get another CB also.

Gomez is just too unpredictable, don't know which Gomez will turn up so he's not someone we should be seeing on our defense anymore at least as a CB. I would be open to sell him or would want him on a loan to have consecutive games to develop his consistency. He isn't going to get that developed here as a CB unless we are willing to have him collapse multiple times during a season.

Kim is a good alternative and i am a little biased since i'm Korean lol. He has a 15 day buyout clause that opens on July 1st. So thats something clubs might target. He refused to delete that clause right now so i guess he is testing waters also",Liverpool,Yes,jatlk94,t1_jatefp4

Thiago left Bayern in a similar way",Liverpool,Yes,jasmb90,t1_jasdiyl
I think with the emergence of Bajcetic this is a possibility for sure. He often tucks in to form a pivot with Fabinho as mentioned by Klopp and thus this allows more attacking freedom for the 3rd midfielders demonstrated against Wolves with Elliott playing further forward in attacking transitions.,Liverpool,Yes,jar0h3l,t1_jaqs1sw
"I can see us playing a 4231 from next season not this tbh. We have too many players who can play the 10 role in this team. Elliot, Carvalho, Jones, Gakpo and Bobby if he chooses to sign an extension. 

Bellingham is also comfortable in a double pivot as he plays there for BVB. This season Klopp has reverted to his safety first 433 with fixed roles and not much rotation, he won't experiment much I feel other than rotating some players to keep them fresh.",Liverpool,Yes,jaqtloj,t1_jaqs1sw

"Its working fairly well right now though, they can both interchange during games as well.

I kind of feel like  the long term plan is still Darwin through the middle its just right now he's more effective on the left, I remember reading that Klopp put Lewandowski at attacking mid when  he arrived becasue his overall game wasn't good enough so playing there allowed him to learn and improve which I feel like is similar to Darwin.",Liverpool,Yes,jaqzxpd,t1_jaqzb6a

it‚Äòs working well and it will continue to do so.

"Klopp takes players and develops them as something else all the time.

Moreno went to a decent club but Villarreal don't even come close to a similar wage-bill as us, even 5 years ago. Can ditto. Wijnaldum we possibly could've sold, but he was still of use to us, so I doubt Klopp actually wanted to.

Ox, Keita, high wages always on crutches. Firmino very good player that we probably could've sold but didn't want to ourselves.

Wijnaldum - Played just over half the minutes at PSG last season as he did with us, discussed being disillusioned with his move there and has since been moved on.

Clyne - 14/13/16 appearances per season since he left. Not week in week out.

Moreno - 18/5/24/12 apps per season. Not week in week out.

I'll give you Lallana as he's on the back end of his career and Emre Can fair enough.

You say they all play week in week out for PL/European teams. In reality they are mostly now all squad players for much smaller teams than Liverpool - and were, almost as soon as they left.

How much do you think we were going to coax out of Milan for an Origi who played just over 300 minutes in the last two seasons with us? A very similar number of minutes for clyne.

Playing at LW this season he has 30 G/A in 24 games. Averaging a G/A every 65 minutes. 

I get the Dutch league isn't the PL and the PL sample size is obviously smaller but he's played 186 games on the wing and 26 at CF. His output is significantly better on the wing.

Keita and Ox will end up at decent teams. Ox probs a mid level PL club and Keita will probably go back to a decent German side. So again it shows they had value in them.

I'm not talking about silly money, I just mean we should have got rid of all these players a couple years previous when they all held that bit more value and it frees up wages and spaces in the squad.

Us having 11 midfielders on the books this season has surely hindered us signing in that area in the last 2 windows. Hopefully this is now the start of a change now.",Liverpool,Yes,jarpst5,t1_jaro30u
">How much do you think we were going to coax out of Milan for an Origi who played just over 300 minutes in the last two seasons with us? 

That's exactly my point though, it's about selling them at the right times. Origi 18/19 scored a few HUGE goals for us in the CL and that winner against Newcastle. His game time was limited but he was very effective when we needed him. We should have gone to him after that season and explained the situation and tried getting rid. He had value 100%.

Fair enough the other maybe not starters every week but they obviously had value for other top clubs to take them.

Keita's injury record pre Liverpool was great. And we've only given him 1 contract so don't know where you've got that from tbh. If you are trying to imply that we couldn't have had a taker for Keita in the last few years you are just chatting shite haha. He's been in his 'prime' years the last few years and half our fans still think he's the best thing since sliced bread. The fact he will end up at a top club playing European football shows he has some worth in him.

But if you are suggesting 424 with Nunez, diaz, Gakpo and salah then you need two top high energy midfielders to play that role.

I agree entirely on your last paragraph though. Keita and Ox moving opens up space on the wage-bill. 

I could see Jones leaving too and Milner retiring. Then maybe one of the players that's a mainstay for now leaving too. Like Fabinho or Thiago. Great players no doubt, but if you can't get them fit enough it becomes a burden.",Liverpool,Yes,jartyw8,t1_jarpst5
"But did anyone actually want Origi sold after that season though? It's an absolute mad argument we can have here to be honest, because you can use his good year that season to say we should have sold then and I can say that season showed what having him in the squad was worth more than the, what, 10m we may have sold him for? You even said it yourself, he was very effective for us. So would it have been worth the fee? Hindsight is of course a wonderful thing.

You can say the obviously had value point about anyone. (And you are being VERY generous by calling Bournemouth, Brighton and Villarreal top clubs). Every footballer on the planet has value, doesn't mean teams are willing to pay money to buy them out of their contract. Put it this way, we could have done with Origi at times this season - but at no point would we consider buying a player like him would we? It's almost a risk free option for teams to take them for free - wages aside of course. 

And with regards Keita, the other half of fans (of whom I presume you are one) believe he is utter shite.

">Both goals coming while be was playing central, after playing most of those games not looking great on the left.

People keep saying this Idk if you are just lying to suit your agenda or you actually don't know but....

Gakpo has played 2 games at LW (1st being his debut) and has played 8 games at ST. 

We haven't seen enough of Gakpo on the left to judge him. So how you can say he's mostly played on the left not looking great. It's just a pure lie.

I actually thought he looked good on the left on his debut. His only other appearance on the LW was 3-0 loss against Wolves where all 11 players looked fucking awful.

">That's the main problem when you're one of the clubs with the highest wage-bills, you can probably shift a lot of your players but do they then want to go?

Bit of a cliche that. You've got clubs coming up from the championship taking players like Lingard on 200k+ a week. 

Origi declined Wolves but did we make it clear to him he had no future here? Going off other players situations I very much doubt it. If we sold him after the 19 season he'd of been 24 years old and had just been pivotal in us winning the CL he'd of had numerous takers if we made that clear to him.

Keita is on 120k a week currently. BVB and Leipzig average salary is 80k per week, But both have several more experienced players well over 120k a week, which Keita would fall in anyway. The fact we were debating giving Keita a new contract as little as 3 months or so ago show this situation has nothing whatsoever to do with no one else offering Keita decent wages.",Liverpool,Yes,javvjom,t1_jartyw8
">But did anyone actually want Origi sold after that season though?

The fact you've asked that show you obviously have this sentimental problem the club have. He had a good impactful end to the season but still played little to no minutes. So why wouldn't we sell him then? He'd of been 24 with 2 years on his contract and had just won the CL with us. We'd of got ¬£20m+ for him defo. 

The season after he started 4 PL games and the season when he left he started 2 and Alisson scored more goals than him. He was never gonna end up getting decent game time so why not sell him when he had value? There's no answer to that.

I didn't mention Bournemouth anywhere? But tbh I'd say any PL club is a top club in the grand scheme of things. And Villarreal won a European cup less than 2 years ago and compete in Europe most years so trying to argue with my point there you really are clutching at straws LOL.

I don't rate Keita at all, you are right. But we've been one of the 2 or 3 best clubs in Europe over the last 5 years. Keita isn't good for us. Doesn't mean he won't go to another club and do well. Like I said previously he will 100% go to another club playing European football in Germany or Spain or something. So what makes you so adamant we wouldn't have been able to shift him at all the last 2-3 years? We are in a world now where Forrest have been promoted and spent 200m+ on about 30 players and giving players like Lingered 200k+ a week. Chelsea have just signed Mudryk who'd previous played 30 career games in the Ukrainian league at 22. And have give him an 8 year contract on 200k+ a week. UTD have spent ¬£100m on Antony who you can see literally has no quality whatsoever. 

Trying to suggest that 2 years ago someone wouldn't have took a punt at a 26 y/o Keita for ¬£25-¬£30m is just so utterly ridiculous it's beyond me. would of freed up ¬£12m+ in wages as well. Yet we've decided to pay him 120k a week for an extra 2 years for him to give us nothing is just shocking business from the club. It's as simple as that. You are allowed to admit that.",Liverpool,Yes,jb49asj,t1_jawtstc

">This time we don't know them, we lost to them very early and they got really good a month after that.

Don't we? Watching them against Leicester told me two things clearly, if you intend to play the high line against them either take your chances ( and trust me Leicester wasted like two to four good chances) 

Or don't be clumsy In defense. That Faes guy literally gave the ball away so easily which led to a break and Rashford goal. 

Either way I am more comfortable playing the liverpool way thanks to Konate being back and Nunez/salah being in good form, jota showing his old fighting sport, Gakpo being settled into the squad now (but I still think Klopp will drop the line back maybe not all the way back but possibly a mid block) 

As long as we don't lose the game in the middle I feel we can do well. Hoping we take their game to them, play quick transitions and play counter attack and utilise Nunez pace along with Salah's link up play to cause havoc. 

Also the game being at home and anfield roaring will definitely help us take the game to them. 

I'll take the score draw, you predicted but I have a feeling this will be like the match in the covid season - United team coming in high spirits having been in good form and we needing a win to keep chances of a top four hope alive. 

I don't know why but I have good feelings about this game. Fingers crossed things go our way.",Liverpool,Yes,jasvjty,t1_jastp9u

"I'll be honest, I thought more of his early appearances (particularly in the 3 cup games against Wolves x2 and Brighton) were on the left. And those were tough watches.

>So are you really writing him off as a LW from those 2 appearances?

No, what a nonsense thing to say, but I'm not sure why you're so pressed about him playing a different position. He needed time and now he's playing really well through the middle. That's where his good performances have come so why change it? 

Klopp has developed players into new positions all the time. (Mane, Firmino, Gini, Trent, Elliott, Bacjetic). Nunez on the left and Gakpo works, why change it? What are you? The position police?",Liverpool,Yes,jarhnjc,t1_jarezov

"It's just strange to me how Gakpo has played 90% of his career on the left and Nunez has played 90% of his career striker. Yet we are playing them the opposite way round. I don't mind Nunez out wide but when Diaz is back Nunez will be going centrally so it just seems strange to me that's all.

The whole 'it's working so who cares' argument is also super strange and invalid to a certain degree. We've won 3 of our last 10 games. And although we look like we've hit some kind of decent form in the PL, I wouldn't say we've looked great in them wins personally. 

And don't mean this as a dig to Klopp but Firmino and maybe Elliot aside, he didn't develop them players into new positions at all haha",Liverpool,Yes,jark76s,t1_jarhnjc
"How can 1 persons opinion make them a walking contradiction? you are clueless. 

I don't rate Keita, but Klopp's given him 13 appearances this season and there was talks about Klopp wanting him to have a new contract. up until very recently most of our fan base had him down as our best midfielder haha. 

Most players that are sold are sold because they are surplus to requirements, if that meant they were worthless to everyone else, most players would be retiring as teenagers lol. Mad I've had to explain that to you üòÇ

Football is a game of opinions, it's what makes it so good. I don't rate Lisandro Martinez, Seen him play a good few times this season and just honestly don't get the hype around him. Yet to a lot of pundits/ex pros he's the best defender in the league this season.

Just because players haven't worked out with us doesn't mean another manager wouldn't take a punt on them. It's worrying that you can't get your head around that üòÇ.

And regarding Origi, that's not what I said at all. He barely played that season but his impact in a few games towards the end of the season would have upped his market value and doing it on the CL stage would put him in the window. Rather then letting him rot on the bench for 2 years to go on a free? 

You do understand that football is a business yes? Why would we not sell a player who had no future with us whilst he actually had some value? And trying to make out no one would have took him is also laughable. We got ¬£25m for Brewster who made 3 appearance for us.

You are utterly clueless lad. Stop replying please haha",Liverpool,Yes,jb98oni,t1_jb5jzpw

"I get what you are saying but Xavi clearly wasn't interested in the Europa league and himself said so, he wanted to concentrate on the la liga where they are eight points ahead and they didn't want to give Madrid an opportunity to come back into contention. 

Just look at the defense he played at home - Alonso in the middle as a cb and Alba as a lb and kessie as a CDM. 

He doesn't play these three in the league, also decided to rest Dembele. 

And in the second leg he had no Gavi due to suspension, pedri due to injury, no Dembele and he decided to play Sergi Roberto on the left lol. 

I think he was on a self sabotage mission and just wanted to get out of the competition. In one of his comments he even said that ""it's hard to motivate Lewandowski for the Europa league"" lol who says that before an important tie.

Also they were lucky to face Newcastle at a perfect time, where their form had dipped leading to the game and they had karius as their starting Gk ( no thanks to us)

But I'll be still be wary of them, just not give them too respect and just be too afraid of playing our game. If we do that then we would have mentally lost the game before the match would have started.",Liverpool,Yes,jaszc5d,t1_jaswton
"Thanks, you keep ‚Äòreading‚Äô those ‚Äòarticles‚Äô and I‚Äôll keep replying üëç",Liverpool,Yes,jas576p,t1_jas4ash
">when Diaz is back Nunez will be going centrally

It'll be a while before Diaz is back to full fitness, and either way Nunez & Gakpo have to compete with Diaz and Jota. For those two positions. It's a good problem to have.

If you remember the preseason before last Ox was playing as a false 9...it was depressing. But maybe Klopp has just been looking for a Bobby alternative/replacement since then and things Gakpo is capable to be the player to do it?

>he didn't develop them players into new positions at all

Mane switching wings wasn't much of a change tbf, but Gini played mostly as a winger/AM for Newcastle, I don't anyone but Klopp was thinking of him as a fairly defensive minded, hard working CM. And Trent wasn't a RB before joining the senior squad. We also got Milner as a LB for a year.",Liverpool,Yes,jarnd2s,t1_jark76s

Okay and get a life in the meantime too ü§£,Liverpool,Yes,jas5fwx,t1_jas576p
"Gini was a central midfielder his entire career before he joined Newcastle, it was actually Newcastle that converted him into an attacking winger role. 

Trent was developed into a RB by Pep Ljinders when he was managing him in the academy. He played loads of positions including CB haha. Same goes for Bajcetic he played CB in the academy but then got developed into a midfielder. You can see from his frame he'd never be a CB. You can't give Klopp credit for that, players play allover at youth level, Carra played as a striker for England at youth level. You can't read too much into these things.

Milner is just a versatile experienced player, Wouldn't class him filling in at full back as Klopp developing him at all tbh.

Mane yes was a predominant right winger but had played a lot of games on the left still. again putting him on the opposite wing isn't re-developing him.

Klopp I'd say is currently attempting to re-develop Elliot as a more disciplined 8 rather than a 10 or a winger. There's a lot of question marks over Elliot in that position atm though. He's took a lot of criticism whilst playing that role.

And yeh he's developed Firmino into one of the best CF in world football for a 3-4 year period. 

I don't wanna sound like I'm slating Klopp, I just don't think what you're claiming is true. I also don't mind the way we play with Gakpo and Nunez either. It's more this false narrative on this sub like Gakpo has played loads for us on the left and has been shite.

"Looking at that VVD article, seeing him and other players play so many minutes reinforces our need for more depth. Him, Salah, TAA, Fabinho, Henderson, and even players who departed like Wijnaldum and Mane have all played excessive minutes for us. Given we train with higher intensity and play with a heavy press, that only worsens their condition. We never gave Fabinho a proper deputy, and I don't think TAA and Salah really had any direct backups that were good enough to rotate and fill in when needed (ala Tsimikas for Robertson). 

Salah has been an ironman, but even he needs to have a break every now and then. We also need to give TAA meaningful breaks (whether it's Gomez at RB or somebody else) and manage van Dijk's minutes as he gets older and already coming off of a few major injuries (with a CB or two being another area we need to strengthen).",Liverpool,No,janxcsf,t3_11fuqn5

TAA, somewhere in the 2nd half, took the game by the scruff of the neck and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. He looked a man possessed which is exactly the kind of attitude needed from him. Thought Salah was largely wasteful while Harvey had a couple bright spots he was generally wasteful as well. Such is the standard we have set over the last 5 years. 

If we decide to pass and move, like we did for the 2nd goal, we trounce United at the weekend. I think Gakpo out wide left with Nunez playing through the middle drifting out wide coupled with Salah tucking in is what we need. Overlapping midfielders will require Baj and Harvey to switch sides, giving the FBs a runner and causing overloads in the channels. I don‚Äôt think Man U can deal with that consistently, but whether we even get to that point is a different discussion all together.

"Klopps had run ins with Tierney before and you can see why, zero consistency in what he calls as a foul, last night wolves were allowed to kick the shit out of Bajcectic, I can see why Jota goal was ruled out from the still frames of the contact with Dawsons leg, but it doesn't take into account there were 3 players going for the ball, Jota got pushed by one defender into the other - anywhere else on the pitch likely not a foul",Liverpool,Yes,jalnau9,t1_jallohu

Sure, there might be some frustrating games here and there, but even prime Barcelona struggled to break down teams in the odd game

Klopp's system is very very effective and if he has the right players and are on form, we will win most games

Teams havent ""figured us out"" but more the players havent been good enough this year",Liverpool,Yes,jalp57f,t1_jalmh09
"There are videos out there but I watched too many and I can't recall which ones they were, sorry. But I'm sure if you just look at tifo football on YouTube or even medium.com you could find something there, that's where I get all my football analysis from.

From what I remember it's basically: Klopp's system relies heavily on 2 things to create goals
1. aggressive pressing in the attacking third and
2. our fullbacks

1 doesn't work anymore because everyone now knows this is how we win games so they stop trying to play out from the back and just hoof it long; they'd rather give us the ball in our own half than lose it in their own half, there's actually a lot of this analysis on medium.com but I can't find the specific articles, sorry again. 

Which is why Klopp has since transitioned us into a possession based side that relies on a mid-press instead, in an attempt to bait teams to play out from the back instead of hoofing long balls. 

(I swear there are direct quotes from Klopp and his team but I don't know where to find them right now I'm so sorry)

As for 2, once we transitioned to a possession based side that does a mid press instead of a high press, pushing the full backs so high up only leaves the flanks badly exposed. It was also a weakness with the high press but because our press was so good last time (both during the high press and mid press phases) the flaws weren't so bad. It's only now that everyone knows to target the flanks because they know our fullbacks are gonna be a little higher up, that's why defensively we've become so bad. It doesn't help either that our midfield has run itself down and people like Henderson, Fabinho and Milner don't have the legs to cover for our fullbacks as well as they used to, Wijnaldum was actually pretty good at doing this but we sold him :(. 

Couple this with the fact that teams know:
- fullbacks leave space behind them
- TAA is the defensively weaker of the 2 fullbacks
- you can't get pass van Dijk easily
- we defend with a narrow backline

the go-to tactic to breaking us down is simply to:

send the ball into the left channel (where Robertson is), drag our backline across, overload TAA with lots of tall people and then cross it over for them to head in.

that or

send the ball into right channel, 2v1 TAA (tho they could 1v1 him and still come out on top), drag the RCB and the RCM over, ping it back into the centre were because the RB, RCB and RCM are all dragged across, there's plenty of space in the middle now and they can create good chances from there. 

All these problems are just flaws with Klopp's system, every system has one, which is why you gotta keep evolving before the enemy catches up to you.

The offense problem existed ever since we stopped our high press system, the defensive one only got exacerbated really bad recently but we could still over-achieve and nullify those effects because Klopp got all our players into an overperforming streak. You can see how in our title winning season 19/20, we had to scrape through a lot of times. Our front 3 had to keep pulling tricks and moments of sheer brilliance out of their magic hats to win us games and this is reflected in our XG for that season. Again I don't have the numbers with me, I'm really sorry, but you can see that we massively overperformed our XG. 

We've been massively overperforming ourselves for at least 2 seasons now. the 20/21 season was a glimpse of what was to come if we didn't do a massive rebuild. That 10 game run at the end where we got 26 out of 30 points, how many of those were from overperformance and individuals stepping up when we needed it the most? Look at TAA's last minute strike against Aston Villa, or better yet, Alisson's only goal for us, the beautiful headed goal from a corner (""... a hero needed in red, or maybe black...""). We can't do that anymore because all of our guys are tired, years of nothing but a monster mentality and a fierce desire to keep going no matter what, no human can keep it up forever, not even our boys.

tldr: Teams have figured out the flaws in Klopp's system and because we haven't evolved quickly enough, they've caught up. Save for a massive rebuild (and maybe a squad overhaul), we aren't gonna be doing as consistently well as we used to.

It's the end of an era gentlemen, it's over for good. But that doesn't mean we are done and dusted, we just need to rebuild, be it minor system tweaks and completely tearing things down and starting afresh. But you can be sure that whatever change we do, there's only one man who can do it and take us into a new period of success. Juergen Norbert Klopp.",Liverpool,Yes,jalpm46,t1_jalmh09
"There are a bunch of videos discussing our downfall and what's wrong with our tactics but I haven't exactly found a video that says we've been found out. But teams kinda have figured us out through the years mostly because aside from blistering counter attacks, we mostly play a pressing high line, compact midfield and bomb our fullbacks forward. Now you could say City and Arsenal play the same way too but they haven't been figured out and you're partially right and the reason is they move the ball faster inside the opposition box and both teams play with creative technical midfielders that contribute a lot to their G/A. 

Ours on the other hand lack these creative midfielders. Something that we've been asking and craving for a while. Thiago kinda is creative but he doesn't score or assist much. That is why we've struggled over and over again to break low blocking teams. 

There's also teams targeting the space left behind from our fullbacks, specially on Trent's side. Of course this issue was always there its just that we had competent midfielders who covered these spaces. Our press also used to work meticulously so the opposition team didn't have much time to exploit these spaces but now they get all the time in the world because our midfielders don't don't close them down fast enough.",Liverpool,Yes,jalqhcy,t1_jalmh09

"A lot of people use him as a scapegoat.

He isn't that good in defensive aspects of his game but there were people blaming all our defensive problems in the 1st half of the season purely down to him as if it was his fault TAA, VVD and Fabinho were having nightmares.",Liverpool,Yes,jam2ojy,t1_jam244m
"I love Harvey and I'm desperate for him to succeed with us and fulfill his potential, and I agree that he gets slaughtered unfairly on here but...I dont think the strength issue is ever gonna go

He's so short that if he bulked up to the point where he could fit one of our 8 positions strength-wise he'd be way too stout and slow. It worked for Trent because he's like 5'11 and has the frame for it, and it could also work for Curtis because he's 6 foot plus, but if Harvey put on a stone or 2 he'd immediately lose a lot of his drive and explosiveness that makes him stand out in the first place",Liverpool,Yes,jam778b,t1_jam244m
"People saying he'll never be a mid for us are being ridiculous but he does need to bulk up if he wants to be a mainstay in the CM role longterm. 

I think he's fine at the moment in any game where we are expected to dominate but I wouldn't trust him to start at CM against top sides.",Liverpool,Yes,jam658n,t1_jam244m
"I think he is more in the mould of Wijnaldum, so he‚Äôs not really an 8 in Klopp‚Äôs Liverpool.",Liverpool,Yes,jan7zfm,t1_jamog1i
"If  we get 2 or 3 CMs next summer, what do you see his role as being?",Liverpool,Yes,jan839z,t1_jamog1i
I think he‚Äôs more of a defensive 8 than a 6 something more along the lines of Gini,Liverpool,Yes,jao4813,t1_jamog1i
"I believe it would have came either way as we were wearing them down the second half, but full from what I remember the first half, not as bad as people were putting on here ofc but second half was much better.",Liverpool,Yes,jamhj1c,t1_jamgwda
"Nah, fuck Spurs",Liverpool,Yes,jaoewcn,t1_janwuhr
let me just remind you how insufferable a club spurs are,Liverpool,Yes,jap7hzo,t1_janwuhr
?,Liverpool,Yes,jaot8nu,t1_jaorkus
"Because you clearly don't know mounts skillset lol. 

He's an 8. A very good one at that when on form.",Liverpool,Yes,jamy83a,t1_jamo24y
"I feel we can‚Äôt judge him properly with this Wolves team, though yesterday he put in a few good blocks for them and also the way he dribbled past our players, nobody could touch him in the first half.",Liverpool,Yes,jam1phe,t1_jam0s9s
"As a depth option he's fine, miles ahead of our current options. But for ¬£45m or whatever the fee is you want better than that.",Liverpool,Yes,jam1us0,t1_jam0s9s
"He‚Äôs good,  but he doesn‚Äôt exactly excite me",Liverpool,Yes,jam1mnm,t1_jam0s9s
"Where in that interview does he confirm he was saving himself for the wc? If anything he says he should have done that, for better longevity.

Sad part is even if we wanted to rest him we don‚Äôt exactly have confidence in our back ups this season. Hope we can get a good cb this summer.",Liverpool,Yes,jamqjyo,t1_jamonii
"This narrative was bollocks before the World Cup, and especially following our January results, bollocks after it an all",Liverpool,Yes,jan5xg0,t1_jamonii
Look at our next five games to get back to earth,Liverpool,Yes,janm7e6,t1_jamzan4
"We did do it about 10 years ago and it made us look stupid. It‚Äôs called Being Liverpool, actually commented about it yesterday",Liverpool,Yes,jalumbu,t1_jaltixu
"It‚Äôs very invasive and the whole club, manager and players have to be on board. Plus people would have to be interested enough to watch too. 

Klopp has gone on record saying he would never consent to something like that happening during his tenure. 

It has certainly helped Wrexham, but then I think that‚Äôs more due to the wider reach of celebrities than the simple fact the documentary was made.",Liverpool,Yes,jaltrg7,t1_jaltixu
"The only series that actually did good for the club is Wrexham but the non-league aspect a big reason for it. 

At worst it would make us look stupid and at best it will be a dull PR piece like the Man City one.",Liverpool,Yes,jam6tcy,t1_jaltixu
Pretty common thing for possesion based teams to do,Liverpool,Yes,jam4xyj,t1_jam49pt
We've done this since Fab joined.,Liverpool,Yes,jam97ns,t1_jam49pt
"With the tough fixtures coming up, we should have won that game. If Darwin was there, I‚Äôm sure we would have won it.",Liverpool,Yes,jalez1g,t1_jale6rw
we surely needed that 3 points but at least we got 1. out of 12 points we could have gotten this 4 games we got 10 so thats not too bad,Liverpool,Yes,jalh0ke,t1_jale6rw
"Not at all over 12 games to go, anything can happen. I take a draw anytime over lost right now. We need to play prime Jose style to get into top 4. Win ugly , waste time when we are up. I honestly don't care.",Liverpool,Yes,jalhg5q,t1_jale6rw
"Elliot has played in midfield for all his Liverpool first team career, therefore he is a midfielder",Liverpool,Yes,jalsek8,t1_jals7j7
"Unfortunately for him the depth in that position is too great, Carvalho is barely seeing minutes there. If only he was left-footed.",Liverpool,Yes,janroxr,t1_janr54c
A lot of the players we buy don‚Äôt see to be at ‚Äòthe level‚Äô we need but then with good training under Klopp they become world beaters. I can see that happening with Mount and Nunes because they‚Äôre clearly very talented players,Liverpool,Yes,jamnqwo,t1_jamk326
"> I think we need 3 next level midfielders.

What do you define by ""next level midfielders"" though? If you mean players like Bellingham then you're looking at over ¬£200m for 3 midfielders.",Liverpool,Yes,jamlfuo,t1_jamk326
"Like klopp said about sturridge, theres a difference between being hurt and injured",Liverpool,Yes,jam3vrq,t1_jam3f3y
Nothing at Leipzig suggested he was going to be Mr. Glassman for us.,Liverpool,Yes,jamec3m,t1_jam3f3y
That‚Äôs wayyyy too defensively vulnerable,Liverpool,Yes,janh7p0,t1_jang3eg
Me,Liverpool,Yes,jankhxl,t1_jang3eg
No?,Liverpool,Yes,janhxgn,t1_jang3eg
"I‚Äôm so torn on Elliott, Klopp clearly loves him, his attitude and desire is evident but if you watch him when he doesn‚Äôt have the ball, he‚Äôs a little scattered, ineffective on most close outs and physically doesn‚Äôt have the qualities that I think we need in that role. 

For example would I take Nunes over him, 100%",Liverpool,Yes,janjn5i,t1_jang3eg
His output on offense does not outweigh his vulnerability on defense.,Liverpool,Yes,jannwir,t1_jang3eg
"I know everyone says he doesn't have the pace for the wings but we haven't really tried it very much and we haven't got another backup for Salah there.

Salah plays basically every minute, I'd like to see him close out games at RW and see what he can do",Liverpool,Yes,jantujk,t1_jang3eg
"Im so happy jota and boby are back
We really need them",Liverpool,Yes,jalhclh,t1_jalgm5x
He's become one of our most important players from the moment he began starting IMO.,Liverpool,Yes,jalw6q6,t1_jalhb14
"I also like that his song is just ‚ÄúNUNEZ NUNEZ NUNEZ‚Äù. 

There‚Äôs something very aggressive and straight to the point about it which he reflects as a player as well!",Liverpool,Yes,jamke53,t1_jamgaus
As someone who had my first son just over a year ago I can confirm the first months are pretty knackering,Liverpool,Yes,jamr1ao,t1_jampsqe
"He was below his old standards before his baby was born though, even 2nd half of  last season he had a noticeable drop off.",Liverpool,Yes,jamslb4,t1_jampsqe
"he is also at his best when he can be agressive to win the ball back, and to do that you need the two other midfielders to cover for you, its trust, which he has lost in the other players as well as in himself",Liverpool,Yes,janekqv,t1_jampsqe
[deleted],Liverpool,Yes,jamxuyo,t1_jamm39y
Are the former Brighton scouts at Chelsea yet? It's clear they know what they're doing.,Liverpool,Yes,jam2mq0,t1_jam1tk4
"Their forwards are all super technical but cant make shit happen at all. Now I think Nunez technically isnt even that bad and rapidly improving too but in a way, hes like the polar opposite of a Chelsea attacker",Liverpool,Yes,janxvmx,t1_janwazr
"Is it the only way? I haven‚Äôt been for years as I don‚Äôt live in the UK any more, but we always used to buy a ticket from a tout in front of the stadium.",Liverpool,Yes,japj71e,t1_janmzih
No.,Liverpool,Yes,jaln8g0,t1_jalm60y
Why would it be bad?,Liverpool,Yes,jalnrxq,t1_jalm60y
you must be new because that‚Äòs just how our system works. bobby did that too and it was great.,Liverpool,Yes,jalppv5,t1_jalm60y
"Depends, you'd like a midfield that can progress the ball without needing one of the forwards to remove himself from the frontline to help out, one less body nearer to goal won't help us score. But if it works, it works.",Liverpool,Yes,jalpq44,t1_jalm60y
"The scheduling of the world cup has fucked it. The teams who went deep in all comps last year are struggling without the usual rest periods. 

Combine that with ~3 years of condensed/disrupted seasons due to COVID and I guess it should be a surprise.

Maybe not to the level we've seen, but a drop off was always likely.",Liverpool,Yes,jamet5b,t1_jamdw0m
"Not sure id agree entirely. I find it hard to believe having watched our last 12 games with my own eyes, I‚Äôm amazed to see we‚Äôve done just as well or poorly as everyone else.",Liverpool,Yes,jami191,t1_jameyi1
I hope Klopp & co watched this game tonight and took some pointers. Tactics 2.0 let‚Äôs go,Liverpool,Yes,jaojgi6,t1_jao7j0n
"It's not magic it's about game styles.

They are a World Class team when they don't have the ball and spaces to run while being a mediocre/decent with the opposite.

La Liga teams play to their weakness, European teams play to their strength",Liverpool,Yes,jaojcas,t1_jao7hh8
"Yeah sitting back deep worked against city, shouldve been more pragmatic against real too. Not an unpopular opinion I think",Liverpool,Yes,jalscze,t1_jalq7on
"Klopp did play conservative against City though, he might put respect for the form of United, City & Arsenal this season, who knows. If we go defensive like against City, we will come out with multiple points I'm sure of it",Liverpool,Yes,jaltu4t,t1_jalr28i
The protection salah gets vs the protection Saka gets is hilarious,Liverpool,Yes,jalhgff,t1_jalh9jo
[removed],Liverpool,Yes,jam1nxl,t1_jam060w
I don't care for Jobe,Liverpool,Yes,jaly6e4,t1_jalwbhc
"We need much thank you. This how top red mindset subtly creeps in. Attack isn‚Äôt sorted for the future also thank you. We can do better. Always.

Sorry not being rude. Just don‚Äôt want to fall into the mindset from winning CL where we all made to believe that the squad was good enough.",Liverpool,Yes,jalm97o,t1_jallge1
Trent grew up so fast,Liverpool,Yes,jalod5n,t1_jalo5cy
"I think I was less crazy about trent because I remember how crazy I was for flanagan. I remember flanagan‚Äôs first game, the crowd cheered ever tackle, every pass, it was amazing. The goal against spurs. With trent‚Ä¶ idk he kinda just immediately became part of the first team so I never had that ‚Äúman I wish he‚Äôll make it‚Äù phase

Also probably a bias against defenders :/",Liverpool,Yes,jalobn2,t1_jalo5cy
The way he receives the ball and looks to play forward????? Looks so simple but how many/often do our other midfielders do that,Liverpool,Yes,jalnp4s,t1_jalni1e
"we got tripple blueballed last season with CL, PL and this

i hope we get at least that if we don't go to CL",Liverpool,Yes,jam14fk,t1_jam0q6k
"Alisson played a really bad pass to him and he managed to turn a couple Wolves player really well, but even that was really scrappy build up.",Liverpool,Yes,jamfdla,t1_jamexgt
Are you putting it above AC Milan or Barcelona?!,Liverpool,Yes,jaoj1zb,t1_jaogsze
"Yeh 100%. 

But even thought we are in decent form the last 4 games. If we take like 10-12+ points from these next 5 games. We get top 4 imo.",Liverpool,Yes,jaleqgm,t1_jalcvvu
"There was one where the Wolves fans were chanting ""if that was us he'd be off"" or something like that over an absolute non-foul.

I'd love Everton to go down this season but I'd almost rather Wolves went down, I can't stand their fans, the poverty cheering tory cunts",Liverpool,Yes,jalrve3,t1_jalorl3
"It's easy to say ""not real fans"" ""not true supporters etc."" I get what you're saying that many probably aren't from Manchester. Although Hillsborough chanters who manage to get tickets to Liverpool away are almost certainly Mancs. 

But it doesn't change the fact most of their fanbase has hardcore supporters from London and abroad. These people all consider United their club and have a dangerous hivemind of opinions.

Im seeing grown men on Tiktok and Twitter get 100,000s of likes on posts responding to this. Grown men saying disgusting things and putting it on the Internet before even doing a quick Google search to realise what they're saying is completely false.

The number of likes and comments from United fans is genuinely concerning. Its a significant portion of their fanbase these days.",Liverpool,Yes,jam5u59,t1_jam3hbn
top 4 doesn't look unlikely at all? What?,Liverpool,Yes,jam8z5l,t1_jam6nyo
I don't think Mount would fancy a season at Left Back of playing back up Right Back during injury crises though. He's only really an 8 or a 10 in terms of position.,Liverpool,Yes,jamml5l,t1_jamg05f
"Mount and bellingham to replace milner and ox would be one hell of a statement in terms of homegrown talent.

Add in one of nunes, caicedo, kone, etc to replace keita and we're looking pretty good. Fabinho, hendo, and thiago as bench options would make us a force.",Liverpool,Yes,janslul,t1_jamnj1n
liverpool players mocked luis diazes brother?,Liverpool,Yes,jalvtk2,t1_jalui7i
"Bruno, B Silva and Richarlison are the holy trinity of smackable faces.",Liverpool,Yes,jany3ny,t1_janrj7y
"Tsimikas should really be playing more. Robbo is better, but not thaaat much better, and Tsimi is good enough to play solid minutes and still bring quality to the squad.",Liverpool,Yes,jao2d52,t1_janzt4r
"Even giving squad players sub appearances to give rest to key starters is a good shout. If we're three goals up, then I don't mind Salah or Trent getting subbed off to get a breather now and then if we have quality backups and depth. 

Of course, with added depth, there's the added benefit of competition and rotation to mitigate injury risks and such players can easily fill in if the starters do get injured.",Liverpool,Yes,jao74n6,t1_janzt4r
I think that‚Äôs why we‚Äôve seen kilman links as of late. Matip out kilman in?,Liverpool,Yes,jam82kn,t1_jam7zdp
Thurams duel rate success is pretty low. Sub 50%. Isn‚Äôt ideal for me,Liverpool,Yes,jam9zgf,t1_jam9rg8
"Still 4 trophies in a season has never been done before and also it means them winning the league aswell which is just terrible

Edit: In fact it's just them winning the league that bothers me they can win the other 3 (they probably will) I can live with that",Liverpool,Yes,jambbxm,t1_jamayqf
"Young midfielder with legs, no major injury record, homegrown 

What else do you need? Not every player is gonna be Bellingham level",Liverpool,Yes,jamj0op,t1_jama4ja
"At his best he's good at creating and scoring goals while still doing a decent amount of defensive work. Best comparison, IMO, is he'd be what Ox was meant to. Whether he'll turn it around I don't know.",Liverpool,Yes,jame4my,t1_jama4ja
the medical team: hold our beer,Liverpool,Yes,jamklv3,t1_jamgpw8
"A big reason for wanting Mount is that he's homegrown.

I'd rather Kone but Mount could be really good under Klopp he's a workhorse with good technical qualities and goalscoring ability from midfield.",Liverpool,Yes,jamgynz,t1_jamgbhz
"How can you say that when the team has an 18 yo who 2 months prior was playing u23 games starting every game 

Any midfielder who has legs is currently welcome, mount is a starter for Chelsea ( or at least should be ) and performed well under previous managers, Nunes is a 24 yo with no injury record 

If those 2 players don‚Äôt cost 80+M, it‚Äôs a good buy 

I don‚Äôt get this subs mentality of ‚Äúthis player is not good enough‚Äù",Liverpool,Yes,jamic9d,t1_jamgbhz
"I agree with this but that‚Äôs not to say Darwin hasn‚Äôt been great. He could finish more chances but just look at how we play without him. He‚Äôs essential for us. Def top 5 this season, I love watching him.",Liverpool,Yes,jamrajc,t1_jamaj8l
"My exact thoughts. 

When watching Salah this season he isn't as effective as he previously has been but 29 goal contributions in 34 games speaks for itself",Liverpool,Yes,jamcfsp,t1_jamapp1
"Agree with this. Our current tactic isn't getting all that we can out of Salah either, which has been incredibly frustrating.",Liverpool,Yes,jang9ly,t1_jamapp1
You're an absolute miserable bastard on this sub. You're on here constantly backing FSGs lack of spending yet you'll turn around and shit on the players? Weird behaviour,Liverpool,Yes,jamim6m,t1_jambov8
"Alisson, Salah, Bajcetic are the only ones who have been better imo.",Liverpool,Yes,jambuhd,t1_jambov8
The El Cashico,Liverpool,Yes,janeb87,t1_jamph3r
"He needs to get his confidence back. He had a brilliant tackle in the Wolves box, and then he fluffed an easy assist to Darwin because he passed as if he was afraid of the ball.",Liverpool,Yes,jama70u,t1_jam9mgf
There‚Äôs a definitely an argument to make that his defensive capability compensated for gaps at the back especially in who‚Äôs lining up next to vvd,Liverpool,Yes,jamalsu,t1_jam9mgf
I'm not against selling him either I'd still prefer that but I think if  Bajcetic is seen as the one to takeover that spot  then having Fabinho there as a rotation option isn't that bad.,Liverpool,Yes,jam1m1z,t1_jam1dd3
The thing  is if you sign someone like Ugarte they're likely going to start most games and that limits Bajcetic's chances.,Liverpool,Yes,jam26wz,t1_jam1fjx
United apparently also want him,Liverpool,Yes,jamma7v,t1_jamiaiv
"Think it was more a brain dead ref tbh. It was a foul, just a harsh yellow",Liverpool,Yes,janjsx0,t1_jandd5a
"Yea we did that for like 20 min, then we ran out of gas",Liverpool,Yes,jaogpkx,t1_jaogcao
"I‚Äôd genuinely pick Milner over Henderson for this right now, Milly has shown he‚Äôs adept at filling in at RB so can help cover Rashford and he‚Äôs honestly playing better than Hendo",Liverpool,Yes,jam39cl,t1_jam0td8
"I think Hendo atm should be on a one game on, one game off policy.  It doesn't have to work that way everytime but let him run himself into the ground, have a break, do it all over again.",Liverpool,Yes,jam2p1o,t1_jam10f4
I sure hope so,Liverpool,Yes,jan56dg,t1_jan4utx
"I don't doubt Kante is still good on his day, just can't comprehend the appeal here. Signing a player who you can maybe rely on for 30% of the season on his wages is absurd and not fitting of the type of risk a top club should be taking.",Liverpool,Yes,jao0121,t1_jan5nu5
[deleted],Liverpool,Yes,jamok6c,t1_jamjzzq
"I looked at the heat map for Bellingham this season and while he's pretty much everywhere on the pitch, there is a tendency to move right more than the left when going forward. I think Klopp is aiming for him to play the RCM role and then Mount would be the LCM since he clearly has a left side bias going forward.",Liverpool,Yes,jan1g02,t1_jamzfk7
We can focus on more than one player at a time- and we should,Liverpool,Yes,janbuzo,t1_jamzfk7
I'd take Kone + Mount + another CM/DM over Bellingham alone,Liverpool,Yes,jan8kt2,t1_jamzfk7
Jude will get number 8,Liverpool,Yes,japb68z,t1_jap6xt0
Yeah that‚Äôs the narrative I‚Äôm trying to understand. I think we‚Äôre just not executing perfectly.,Liverpool,Yes,jamf0vv,t1_jalp57f
Thanks for this. Very insightful. So it‚Äôs basically just lack of evolution and fresh personnel more than a tactical masterclass by like everyone in the world.,Liverpool,Yes,jameqit,t1_jalpm46
That interplay between Moutinho and Sarabia at the start had me worried.,Liverpool,Yes,jalwv6z,t1_jalp5n0
"You can tell Darwin has bought into the philosophy and system. Just wants to see the team win, I‚Äôm not worried about him at all.",Liverpool,Yes,jandxr1,t1_jan7jsb
Yep. Tough situation all around.,Liverpool,Yes,jalj0sn,t1_jalit8e
"I think we need to lose this outlook that the lad is being hard done by. Yes it's not ideal for the club that we have to rely on him but he will be absolutely buzzing, I don't feel for him at all.

Representing Liverpool at 18 is a fucking dream come true. Ask any of Fowler, Owen, Gerrard, Trent if they think people should have felt for them back then.",Liverpool,Yes,jallvx9,t1_jaljy90
He's meant to return to training proper this weekend,Liverpool,Yes,jam6iwr,t1_jam4vd4
"Play 3 at the back with Trent as the wingback, or 4222 with him as the wide midfielder.",Liverpool,Yes,jao4sci,t1_jao30i5
"Trent has 2 assists the whole season this year lol

If we start with Salah, Nunez, Gakpo/Jota, and have Diaz come off the bench, I'm sure we would be able to score 3 without Trent

Ideally Trent should start but Klopp doesn't seem to want to play him anywhere else on the pitch so I'm not sure where he would play 

Starting with Trent as the RB leaves us with Benzema/Vini 2vs2 against our CBs, which is...not ideal",Liverpool,Yes,jao5e01,t1_jao30i5
"Gomez started his Liverpool career at LB and was solid, played a lot of games at 19 years old. How long have you been supporting us?",Liverpool,Yes,japi65s,t1_jap7c1k
"Klopp and Pep have been converting number 10s into 8s and (false) 9s for a decade now, don't see that changing either. There's not much difference between an attacking 8 and a 10 anyway in a high press system, if you look at where Harvey is receiving the ball on average he's between our 9 and Salah. It's basically where you want him.",Liverpool,Yes,jamaynn,t1_jam8zam
"This isn't really true though. Plenty of players have bulked up a lot (Salah if you want an example close to home) and not lost pace. Adding muscle to the legs, the hips and the core is vital for every player between after they've stopped growing upwards.",Liverpool,Yes,jam8drx,t1_jam778b
I reckon he starts against Madrid.,Liverpool,Yes,jam6r07,t1_jam658n
"As a 6, he honestly has whats needed to be a world class holding mid in the future and you don't find those very easily so having one thats came through the academy is massive.

He just needs to bulk  up a bit and to keep gaining more experience there isn't any big holes in his game already at 18, apart from a little bit of sloppiness on the ball at times but thats something  thats will get ironed out over time",Liverpool,Yes,janhx93,t1_jan839z
"Imo he's either the starter at DM or he's the back up to a new DM after having lost a competition during the summer camp sessions. 

Jude and Thiago are the first-choice #8s with Henderson, a second new midfielder, a third new midfielder (maybe, depending on whether they sell Jones), plus Milner and Elliot as the reserves.",Liverpool,Yes,janfaz3,t1_jan839z
I'd be happy to be proven wrong:),Liverpool,Yes,jamyzoj,t1_jamy83a
"Finally, our gini replacement.",Liverpool,Yes,jam1u0n,t1_jam1mnm
"We haven't seen him at his best when he's played against us thats why, we have seen flashes of what he can do even yesterday he went on a really nice run past 3/4 players.

He's a legit great progressive dribbler,  I'm not convinced thats what we need if we are getting Bellingham as well though.",Liverpool,Yes,jam22sc,t1_jam1mnm
"We have done when the press doesn't work. Definitely. But we seem to have abandoned the press to do this entirely instead. Maybe I'm wrong, it just seemed to scream out at me yesterday.",Liverpool,Yes,jambc4e,t1_jam97ns
Definitely. Hope he‚Äôs fit all the way through the run in now. We need him.,Liverpool,Yes,jalf537,t1_jalez1g
Actually 14 games still remaining.,Liverpool,Yes,jali7io,t1_jalhg5q
Tbf he has plenty of time on his hands to make the transition into one later down the line,Liverpool,Yes,jansi4k,t1_janroxr
"Idk man. You could say the same about Nunez but in that case it was clear he had something special, even if he was/is very raw.",Liverpool,Yes,jamt6ir,t1_jamnqwo
More like 200m for 2 midfielders of that quality.,Liverpool,Yes,jamlsny,t1_jamlfuo
"I think we need someone like Bellingham , but someone like Casemiro not in position but a side changing signing, like what VVD did for our defense. And the third a guaranteed starter , Kone and kephram are both there between the 30-40m range",Liverpool,Yes,jamqpsp,t1_jamlfuo
Yeah alright a lot of people say no,Liverpool,Yes,januiff,t1_janhxgn
"Talking RW back up, I think long term we prep for Doak in that role, he looks like he has more explosive pace, two-footedness and an intangible aggression that I‚Äôd prefer to see over Elliott in the same role TBH. Up to the two lads to battle it out I guess.",Liverpool,Yes,janv2w5,t1_jantujk
Nearly 5 years in and I don't remember what it's like not to be tired.,Liverpool,Yes,jamuray,t1_jamr1ao
About to have my first end of May/June - why is it so exhausting?,Liverpool,Yes,jan7y6w,t1_jamr1ao
"You're probably right, but I saw the drop in form in the time when his wife would've been pretty pregnant to now being severe while end of last season felt more like he was exhausted. Obviously all hefty speculation. Just glad he put in a quality shift yesterday and optimistic it'll stick",Liverpool,Yes,jamyqyh,t1_jamslb4
"Fair enough, I can see that being true.",Liverpool,Yes,jandafa,t1_jamxuyo
"They are

The problem isn't the players they're signing on an individual level its how they are going about doing it, signing that many players at once, overpaying for a lot of them and I can gurantee Potter isn't even the one wanting them its Boehly so he's signing players the manager probably doesn't even want.",Liverpool,Yes,jam32zu,t1_jam2mq0
"You say that, but our success under Klopp was defined by a midfield that did not progress the ball and a forward helping out and we scored tons of goals, and moving away from that system has made us defensively worse.",Liverpool,Yes,jalreno,t1_jalpq44
"Since the disaster at Wolves and Brighton, we have tightened up at the back and the past month we have been good, we're slowly finding a way to get the attack up to speed too. If you spend all your time whinging about Henderson and FSG, then you won't have noticed it.",Liverpool,Yes,jamm8bo,t1_jami191
Definitely. But City walked into our trap. Utd on the other hand won't.,Liverpool,Yes,jalu76w,t1_jaltu4t

Fabinho and Thiago at their peak are top class, but Fabinho has been run into the ground and Thiago is injury prone. Henderson and Milner are good quality players but aged and can't be relied on. Kieta and Ox are ridiculously injury prone. Jones doesn't seem to have got any better than he was 5 years ago when he's really at the age now where he should have been a regular in the starting 11.

"There's a common problem that businesses with a lot of outside capital run into - misallocation. We've seen this over the last decade in tech, where venture capital flooded in and businesses were able to sustain huge losses until the central banks stepped in and hiked. Now a lot of these companies immediately fired 30-70% of staff and had to trim a lot of (useless) opex to become more efficient profitable (or less lossy) machines.    

 I think the Brighton scouts are probably excellent at what they do - industry leading, in fact - but the usual process for buying a player would be to identify the type of player, have a long-list, get it down to a shortlist, see who is available, make a cost benefit analysis of each target and go for that player. If the player isn't available now then maybe you wait a year or move to your second target. Chelsea right now have been told that they MUST spend ¬£600m this year and that they can sign every target they want. The process is accelerated and inefficient. It's wasteful and scattergun.   

I'm sure Boehly is a smart guy but that's probably the problem. He thinks he's coming to Europe to teach people how football should be done (just read his own comments) but there's a reason that a lot of things are the way they are and there's a reason why nobody historically has bought ¬£600m worth of 23 year old talents in the January window and thrown them together under an inexperienced manager and expected everything to work.

Ideally in the summer we can get a midfield overhaul.

For one thing, no it really isn't lol 1) its pretty basic biomechanics - there's diminishing returns on size = power = speed, which is why sprinters have big legs but not as big as hill cyclists or power lifters 2) footballers need a balance of fast *and* slow twitch muscles because they're in a hugely endurance based sport

And the main thing is that having big legs and hips rarely have direct impact on the ""strength"" of player relative to how we describe the strength of a footballer unless they play/run/shield a certain way like Hazard or Wijnaldum

Harvey certainly does *not* carry a football like those two, and is very upright when going into duels, and would need a bigger back, shoulders, arms and chest  to shield better.

Definitely not, adult don't suddenly get a lot faster, even an Olympic sprinter - who trains in a fraction of the aspects a footballer needs to train - will only get marginally faster once they've gone through puberty

"I wouldn't mind someone like Kone who won't cost more than 40-45 mill at best and would do a good job at both 6 or a defensive 8. 

A lot of his traits and stats actually complement Bellingham and vice versa. 

They are number 1 and 2 for successful tackles in Bundesliga this season and are again 1 and 2 for successful take ons. 

He is also press resistant, good at ball progression, good passing stats as well. Even his interception rates are quite decent and a good block percentile. 

I think Bellingham and Kone can form a strong partnership together. 

Also he would cost less than say Caicedo who would cost something around 70 mill plus and Rice who Westham around 80 mill. Kone is as good as them and would cost half the price.",Liverpool,Yes,jaijlu0,t1_jaigjgh

">They're not going to spend.

Yes that's why actual investment is paramount especially this summer. Imagine if you are Klopp and how would he feel especially when he came out and said the owners need to put in money this summer. He would feel betrayed if he didn't get backed in the window, especially after all he has done for the club with less resources than any manager in the top 6.

While in the champions league the max sum you can get for winning the competition without losing any group stages is a sum of about 85.14 mill euros. 

We got around 81 mill euros for making the final in Kviy some year back.

So again the difference wouldn't be much, we might have actually earned more than even Real Madrid considering they lost a group stage game to Sheriff and lost a game or two over two legs on the way to the final.

What we know for sure is that they don't want to use their own money for funding a rebuild but are happy to use others. 

So I don't see why they would go all the way to put out news that they are seeking investment into the club, have Klopp come out and make statements putting pressure on them to fund a rebuild and then back out of all of that at the last moment.

But Fabregas had a longer peak than any of these players and his versatility would put him over any of these names for me at least.

He started off at age 16 in an arsenal side which had proper leaders like Veira, Gilberto Silva in midfield and still broke in and he was playing at a good level even in his 30s and  could play so many roles from deep laying playmaker to a 10 or even false 9 so effectively.

"IDK, Man Utd are a shadow of Real Madrid, lacking the silky one-touch passing to capitalize on counters. Anything is possible but Real Madrid is likely to just park the bus in the second leg even more than usual.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1bs59,t1_jb18par
"Whole back line got absolutely rinsed by the same play Chelsea used in the FA Cup semi final to score on us. Incredible how we let the same thing happen to us twice. Walker pinched up and got caught out the way Cancelo had before, and Zinchenko was too slow to react on the other flank.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0128r,t1_jazvdtb
"The only one that I think there‚Äôs any argument for is Zinny, his presence was huge regardless of if he was playing or not. I think that‚Äôs something that we‚Äôre now missing and has also been a huge advantage to Arsenal.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0btx0,t1_jb030zr
"I mean having the current version Sterling wouldn't really have helped us much, his old form doesn't seem to be coming back. Jesus we straight up upgraded on so that's not a problem. The one we miss most is Zinny and that too because our starting LB decided to have a temper tantrum, we were at least alright in the fullback department before that.",Manchester City,Yes,jb07mih,t1_jb030zr
"You cant please everyone

. If Rodri was penalised for his handball against everton (who then score the pen and we tie) and pool won the league , everyone would scream "" pep should have signed a striker, we need a proper #9""
This season, we aren't winning so now the narrative is we are better without a striker.

The reality is this season we are very slow and lethargic. Too many players with shocking form and poor attitude. If we kept players like sterling, the dressing room would be a mess because he really didn't want to be there.

Arsenal have been extremely hungry this season. Every player works Thier ass off. Our players,  for whatever reason have been extremely of the mark all season, bar a few individuals - so it's not easy to say .",Manchester City,Yes,jb0o3bz,t1_jb030zr
"Is the video suggesting we made a mistake by selling three players for around ¬£130mn while admitting the difference they made was only 5pts over 26 games? They can‚Äôt have simultaneously been an essential part of our team but only leave a small gap in their absence. That logic isn‚Äôt logic-ing for me.  

On the other hand, if the video‚Äôs suggesting that the three players leaving was part of a much needed squad shakeup, which has an adjustment period and was exacerbated by the World Cup, then yeah, I can see their point.",Manchester City,Yes,jb04rsk,t1_jb030zr
Not replacing them with proper profiles is why.,Manchester City,Yes,jb05dj6,t1_jb030zr
I guess at one point these players need to move on if they don‚Äôt think City best place for their career. It‚Äôs just Pep can‚Äôt guarantee any starter. It‚Äôs normally team could be volatile when players in and out but look at Grealish - most our players could easily get interstates second year onward. Probably not our year this year but we are always there.,Manchester City,Yes,jb0abjr,t1_jb030zr
"There's some truth in that. Those three players were very much core players, been there done that. Now replacing player to player we have done that otherthan Zinchenko but the experience that Sterling and Jesus had we lost that this season, plus new players are taking time to gel, to understand Pep and his tactics, playing with a no 9 after 2 yrs, will take time to fully adjust. So if you add all things together than yea.",Manchester City,Yes,jb051x5,t1_jb030zr

"still a few bogey stadiums...  Sellhurst and St Mary's have been troublesome grounds in the past. 

Going to Brighton and Brentford will also be difficult. I still fear Liverpool, even if it is at the Etihad. They always show up against City, no matter what form they are in. At Everton at the end will be tough since they could be fighting relegation, and we looked bad against them at the Etihad. I think going to Craven Cottage could be a tricky fixture as well. 

City can do it though. It will be difficult but it can be done.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0hoxr,t1_jazqwwn
NEVER FELT LIKE SINGING THE BLUES...,Manchester City,Yes,jb1gq8i,t1_jb1eo3y

"The likes of Terry, Lampard and Drogba were very technical as well. But they were more renowned for their competitive and tough nature. I mean Mourinho‚Äôs teams at their peak were technically brilliant as well but not as nimble. 

I think our current team is more inclined towards Mourinho teams than how you would visualise a typical Pep team.",Manchester City,Yes,jazvisd,t1_jazujsw
Martinez and Antony honestly look like they are more level-headed than bruno and Shaw.  All 4 of them did horrible things this match but only the former 2 were aware of it. Bruno and Shaw literally dared the refs to card them.,Manchester City,Yes,jb1iub8,t1_jb1glr3
"in-form Salah is not something even the best version of Ake would want anywhere near him. No shame in admitting that. 

Just like how liverpool don't wanna see an in-from ( or even out of form) bernado anywhere on the pitch.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1hv8g,t1_jb1halh

"It's worrying me now because we still have to play Liverpool. It's at home thankfully but the last thing we need is them suddenly finding form.

I guess Arsenal still need to go to Anfield at least.",Manchester City,Yes,jb2jck1,t1_jb1molg
"I classed Leipzig and Forest separately because I thought those were games where we didn't perform terrible, rather, in those games we were either not clinical enough or the opposition were great. 

In games like Everton and Brentford, it just felt like I was watching a City team I couldn't recognise.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0nph4,t1_jb0n5x1

"Just a joke about Haaland going to Madrid, but not the one everyone expects. Because he was doing some top tier shit housing in yesterday's game like Atletico has engrained in them.

Not quite as obvious as I thought if it needed explaining perhaps. Stuck the /s on there so people would get the joke but no worries.",Manchester City,Yes,jazpj2e,t1_jazpasr
"Yeah but now that United have fallen behind I don‚Äôt want them to rescue anything. If they had taken the lead at Anfield and then bottled it then I‚Äôd be pleased with a draw

Oh yeah but I think buying a new FB would end up sounding like a club statement about the situation unless they release one before that or the whole thing is solved.,Manchester City,Yes,jb13jdv,t1_jb12qig
I do remember it and I'm seeing what Chelsea is doing to good players.,Manchester City,Yes,jb159k8,t1_jb1532z
"Grealish was one of the best players on the pitch, football is nit about g/a. His ball career, one twos were excellent. Also he is great on the ball very tough to get the ball from him and he is relatively strong guy",Manchester City,Yes,jazpj33,t1_jazlopo
"Foden's clutch too, but what I love is that Foden is capable of thriving with huge responsibility on a daily basis. Yesterday, first 30 minutes he was pretty much the driving force behind everything City did.",Manchester City,Yes,jazsnjy,t1_jazk7mx
"Actually, can someone look up the data for teams that get the most cards for dissent?",Manchester City,Yes,jb14y9k,t1_jb14ir8
"Exactly. 

Real madrid (especially in UCL) are masters at capitalizing counters and they always like to be dominated before showing reality to the other team. They enjoy their phase of being the underdog team and can never thrive with too much possession (example of how they struggle against heavy bus-parking La liga terrorist teams",Manchester City,Yes,jb1mx1l,t1_jb1bs59
"His mentality is unreal. I thought in the early days he was just one of those guys who was just happy to be at City, but it turned out he‚Äôs probably the hungriest and most ferocious winner of the bunch. His passion is infectious and I agree with you: he‚Äôs helped to galvanize that Arsenal dressing room to our detriment.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0lv4s,t1_jb0btx0
"Long term that‚Äôs a good take.

But if we lose the league by a couple points this season, you could absolutely make the claim selling Zinchenko to the winners was a pretty terrible decision in hindsight.",Manchester City,Yes,jb05kux,t1_jb04rsk
I don't know but what funnier is the game being played at St. James Park instead of Etihad. ü§£,Manchester City,Yes,jazoyfe,t1_jaznfe8
Right? My memory of actual games I've watched aren't this clear.,Manchester City,Yes,jazxzdg,t1_jaznfe8
I thought he was benched by Zinchenko because of tactical reasons. That means we don‚Äôt have many left back options to look into in the summer. At least I can‚Äôt think of any.,Manchester City,Yes,jb05dy4,t1_jazwyxz
"Lampard I agree, but Terry and Drogba were clearly not technical players. I mean Drogba was memed a lot in the sports newspapers back then for having a poor first touch, same as Haaland today. Terry was a very good all-round defender but he had to play with more technical players to bring a balance to the back line. He paired with Carvalho who was the technical player in his early days, and in the national team, Ferdinand who was clearly better on the ball than Terry. 

The closest you'll get to find a technical Mourinho team is his Madrid team but his teams at Chelsea, Inter, United, Tottenham and Roma show that Mourinho has always favored competitive and ""pashun"" type players over technical players. This City team is nothing close to a typical Mourinho team.",Manchester City,Yes,jazxn7k,t1_jazvisd
"We also still won the title, so it‚Äôs all good",Manchester City,Yes,jb1hk23,t1_jb1h17i
"yea but we play them at home, arsenal will have to deal with them at anfield, even if liverpool are truly back i feel like we can take care of them at the etihad, arsenal have the much tougher job having to play them at anfield. hopefully will be a nice 3 point swing in the table.",Manchester City,Yes,jb37w74,t1_jb1gnlw
[deleted],Manchester City,Yes,jb3783v,t1_jb1gnlw
"in all seriousness, though, the camaraderie he had with Jack there is the kind of thing that may keep him around",Manchester City,Yes,jb095dy,t1_jazpj2e
It's a tough one honestly. I love seeing United getting punked but don't want Liverpool getting top 4. United is the absolute worst for me... but I cannot take any joy with Liverpool doing anything positive.,Manchester City,Yes,jb17zov,t1_jb17ahm
"Not at the moment because Diaz is injured, but he was really good at the start of the season",Manchester City,Yes,jb1gg7x,t1_jb1eone
Ahhhh I forgor about that üíÄ,Manchester City,Yes,jb16il3,t1_jb159k8
"I meant to say he had an okay game and Almiron was just there to be fair. I don't judge Grealish by G/A. He was actually very important in the Bernardo goal but other than that wasn't really involved in the attacking phase of play like Foden. 

He also failed to track back and help Ake out defensively and Murphy exploited that and was just spamming crosses in, they should have scored from one of those if both Wilson and Joelinton didn't have a brain fart when the ball was at their feet.

Grealish didn't have a bad game but to say he was one of the best players on the pitch is stretching it for me.",Manchester City,Yes,jazqjak,t1_jazpj33
"It‚Äôs not a terrible decision if it‚Äôs part of a natural overhaul of the whole team that will ensure success in the next 5 or 10 years. Pep‚Äôs City is what it is (and Klopp‚Äôs Liverpool) because they have a long term plan and are not looking only for short term success,  Like United and Chelsea have been. Ultimately you can‚Äôt win the league every year.",Manchester City,Yes,jb06v7o,t1_jb05kux
"Not sure about that, can‚Äôt be a pretty terrible decision if the gap is just a few points. I love Zinny but he wasn‚Äôt exactly our best defender consistently, and the form Ake is in right now would‚Äôve just meant more bench time for Zinny. There‚Äôs a reason he wanted to leave and we let him go. 

I think an extra goal in a couple of draws was what we needed to make up the difference this season. None of the three players were huge goal contributors in recent seasons. Jesus was only brilliant in patches and even Sterling never managed to regain pre-Lyon form consistently. I would blame the World Cup‚Äôs weird schedule for our gap more than missing Zinny or the others tbh.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0b4zg,t1_jb05kux
Your memory is great even though it remembers a shite dream like that.,Manchester City,Yes,jazut0b,t1_jazoyfe
Couldn't agree more. Especially if we can get a certain dorts player he is good friends with. He and grealish have a great bond. I mean everyone seems to love grealish but that grealish haaland Phil front 3 can get some real nice chemistry going,Manchester City,Yes,jb09tow,t1_jb095dy
Well it is still nice to watch the rags to get absolutely dunked on,Manchester City,Yes,jb18kol,t1_jb17zov
"Maybe but i feel like Nunez, Gakpo and Salah slowly finding their rhythm even if Diaz comeback he won't start ahead of these trio at the moment.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1hcp1,t1_jb1gg7x
"I think that‚Äôs looking too theoretical and granular. 

If Arsenal had to start and rely on Tierney all season then would be on at least 5+ less points by the end of the season. 

If we had Zinny as depth we may have gained 1 or 2 extra points over the whole season. 

He is a bigger difference for them than us.

That‚Äôs probably a potential 6 point swing on average to a title rival which is a huge difference if it‚Äôs the difference between winning the league or not. 

Absolutely not worth the transfer fee imo. Hindsight does help though. I‚Äôm sure no one at the club thought Arsenal would be challenging with it without Zinchenko.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0fos4,t1_jb0b4zg
"Fair, I would be surprised if he just came in and picked up from before. I‚Äôm thinking long term he‚Äôs better based on what we‚Äôve seen.",Manchester City,Yes,jb1i46n,t1_jb1hcp1
"Not really, I think you‚Äôre making up scenarios to fit your theory. Arsenal would‚Äôve just bought someone else. Everybody was crediting Jesus with their attack but they kept going even without him. 

Maybe they would‚Äôve spent more to get someone? Maybe someone else would‚Äôve stepped up? Maybe Zinny sitting on our bench would‚Äôve been less sharp when brought on and actually cost us points from a mistake? 

A lot more moving parts with your scenario than mine, which is that slightly better finishing in key matches is what we have really needed so far. It‚Äôs all a moot point though, we‚Äôll only know by the end of the season for sure. If we do win we won‚Äôt care about Zinny or anyone else leaving, and if we lose then people will blame everything from Ederson to selling Zinny to Pep‚Äôs tactics.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0h099,t1_jb0fos4
"There is literally no way to know how Arsenal would be doing with Tierney or us with Zinny. Fabian Delph won two titles with us while playing as a left back. Leicester won the title with relative nobodies. Liverpool added four exceptional players and are barely going to scrape 4th, if they get there at all. No use talking hypotheticals as fact when he have no idea what could have been.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0ig0o,t1_jb0fos4
"Maybe. I think it is quite simple though. 

Zinchenko has been absolutely essential for them and they way they play.

He would have been useful for us. 

That translates to some points over a season.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0imh4,t1_jb0h099
"If there is no way to know then what it the point in 99% of all football discussion? 

I think it‚Äôs incredibly likely that one of their most important players this season has indeed helped them.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0iu94,t1_jb0ig0o
"Kind of, he played for them around the same time as Cancelo‚Äôs played for us this season (both 3 G/A). I think there are other players like Saka, Odegaard, or Saliba that were more essential. 

Like I said though, this will all be more clear after the season ends.",Manchester City,Yes,jb0ktzy,t1_jb0imh4

It makes me realised that once pep leaves its hard imagine what would happen to us, this sense of security we often taken for granted under pep that no matter what happens, we would still be at the top would be gone, the future would be very uncertain.

"I completely agree, for me it's more the fact that most of these articles refer to her with the paraphrased part of the quote as ""Haaland's agent"" as if its coming directly from him, I find it really misleading given they're using pictures of him in the article and using it as ""bulletproof evidence/suggestion he is leaving the club or looking for a transfer"" 












I completely see why the journos and publications do this though, it's just free clicks. It's just getting boring at the minute, he hasn't even finished his first season here and he's been ""on his way to Madrid soon"" since the club announced they'd signed him, every few days haha",Manchester City,Yes,jar1eru,t1_jaqvijt

We really do. Micah gets a lot of flak but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs easy holding your own on a UCL panel with Henry. He gets a lot of shit due to our lack of UCL success but he takes it well and gives it back too.,Manchester City,Yes,jav7am5,t1_jav4che
He is arguably our best cb. Less than ¬£60m is poor business.,Manchester City,Yes,jaqmyr4,t1_jaqicru
Who says he wants to leave? FFS we should enjoy the season and not keep worrying about what KFC tier bullshit journos spew online for clicks.,Manchester City,Yes,jarlm9t,t1_jaqicru
Yeah he's probably the best CB on the ball out there and regularly tops passing accuracy charts but the team he'd probably suit most is Barca and they're supposedly broke so it'll be hard to get his full worth,Manchester City,Yes,jaqz105,t1_jaqicru
"Can't argue with that. Sam Lee is always interesting when he gauges peps mood. Some he can't help but tell all and give a good insight to tactics, others he is hilarious and jovial.

"My biggest question for next season is what our backing is going to be.

I think Dias and Stones are pretty locked on to stay unless something unexpected comes up. Akanji likely stays because he just came and he‚Äôs gotten good playing time. 

Which leaves Ake and Laporte which I think at least 1 of them will want to leave. IMO I think Laporte would leave because he wants to be a regular starting every game possible. They are both 28 and have been our best CBs at times, I just hope both don‚Äôt leave. 

Which leaves the fullbacks. Rico I think should be the starting RB next year no questions, unless his play really drops off this year. Ake could be the option at LB but I‚Äôm not sure what the plans would be? 

Either way I think we see a bit of a shake up but as long as Dias stays and is healthy, that‚Äôs really all that matters. Is he the difference maker.",Manchester City,No,jaoke3b,t3_11fy0eb

"Been having evergrowing feelings of anxiety over the 2nd leg vs Leipzig lol. If you stop and think about it, it's the perfect recipe for slipping up and crashing out. It's typical - we weren't even close to good enough in the 1st leg to get a better result, and Leipzig were not exactly on their game either. It's all set up for an Etihad heartbreak where we don't turn up and Leipzig play decent. 

They pose a huge threat on the counter ofc, and if they score the first goal or we show up not at it, they can easily capitalise. They have nothing to prove, we have everything to prove and need to have a good performance if we're to advance. Imagine Leipzig getting the 1st goal and how that might rattle the fans and players. Imagine Werner and Nkunku on the counter vs Akanji and Rodri on a bad day. 

idk man it just stinks, it reeks. Could be giant banana peel. Hopefully not though, cheers!",Manchester City,No,japogij,t3_11fy0eb

if he goes to Arsenal that could be bad.... not sure he would accept being a back up to Rodri here though.,Manchester City,Yes,jamv7y3,t1_jam43m3

"Walker has reportedly not been super happy. And if he continues to fight for the place with Lewis and loses out, I could actually see him pushing for a move too sadly. 

I agree Laporte would be the one to likely leave, I think Ake is rumoured to be signing a new deal? so yeah, and Laporte has rumbled a bit in the past anyway when he doesn't play. 

Cancelo yeah. I think it's just sensible to sell him, I just hope we can get something respectable for him since the quality is there.",Manchester City,Yes,jaoswpz,t1_jaoke3b

"Leipzig will have to take a page out of forest‚Äôs playbook to have any chance of beating us. Are they willing to be patient and sit back ala real madrid to hit us on the transitions? Are they solid enough to weather the storm in the first half? Whoever scores first will pressure the other to come out more. My bet is on city to score first and force leipzig to chase the game.

"Barcelona has no money, tebas has already come out to say they need to sell before buying. Plus Lewandowski is there so not as if alvarez is going to walk right in. Real has benzema who is still going strong albeit at 35 years old. Is alvarez willing to go to madrid and wait again for his chance? Plus they have an incoming endrick and not forgetting their eternal love affair with mbappe.

"Lot of nonsense coming from the Spanish Media. City aint' selling... especially after 1 year. Bernardo been wanting to go for how long now? no way City let Alvarez go this soon. 

Pep is cooking something up with Alvarez and Haaland. Him playing the 10 behind Haaland has looked good in the limited time we've seen it. Once Alvarez gets a summer to rest after a year straight of playing... I see Pep unleashing it full time next season.",Manchester City,Yes,japvn9u,t1_jap9ack

"Walker is 32 going on 33 and I think he is already losing his edge (as expected). He‚Äôs not a good enough defender to be starting if he doesn‚Äôt have his pace imo and I fear it‚Äôll be any day now he loses his pace. The consistency of his performances has really dropped off. 

I love him but I think Rico is coming through at the perfect time.",Manchester City,Yes,jaowmhp,t1_jaoswpz
"Fair point, think the agent is tryna drum up interest, and Barca could do with a lw (they could do with some better finances too tbf). Was just interested that the agent had come out and said it.

Lol no,Manchester City,Yes,jan3pdg,t1_jan1awv
I heard Cancelo has been playing well at bayern,Manchester City,Yes,jap1s4j,t1_jaoniai

"How is it forcing him there when he's played there before?

And there is practically nobody at those two's level, but this is an elite level talent we're talking about. Elite defensive reading, a dribbling ability to keep the ball at a high level that not many young prospects like him possess. I would take him in a heartbeat because he's just that good.

And I feel like City are going to evolve into a double pivot side with all the names thrown around and he'd be PERFECT there.",Manchester City,Yes,janbu1b,t1_janaaag
"That‚Äôs true but if they sold him for 30m I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked. 

Honestly my dream is a Cancelo and Sane swap.",Manchester City,Yes,jaoob5u,t1_jaonvrp
"Oh yeah 100%, I‚Äôm not even sure what they would do then. If everyone stayed I could see Pep putting Stones on the right more",Manchester City,Yes,jap9x7u,t1_jap8swo
We wouldn‚Äôt have let him go if he was at the level you think he is tbh. We keep going through this every year. We let go players and this sub claims we made a mistake because they would be perfect  for us. Then a season later it turns out they weren‚Äôt that good. Rinse and repeat.,Manchester City,Yes,jane7v0,t1_janbu1b
"I thought about that too but we would be getting robbed in that deal lol. I love sane to death but he's not really the same player that we had before. He has lost his pace but his technical quality is good tho, so for a good price i will be happy with signing him.",Manchester City,Yes,jaooqbp,t1_jaoob5u
Yeah Stones is good in that role. Akanji too maybe.,Manchester City,Yes,japt3na,t1_jap9x7u
"Mistakes can always be made. Always maintained he's elite.

Just watch Southampton, guy is a level above everyone and he's 18! That itself should tell you.

I've never been particularly annoyed or upset over loaning or selling players, but Lavia is that guy.",Manchester City,Yes,janhhaz,t1_jane7v0
"How many times has the club been wrong about letting a player go though? I just don‚Äôt see him as a starter for us, at best second choice and he doesn‚Äôt want that.",Manchester City,Yes,janjalw,t1_janhhaz
"Very rarely, but why not believe that it can happen?

I wouldn't even bluff because you don't see many versatile 6s like him. Pep rated him too, which is why we saw him train with the first team so young. Think he'll be around till next season. Once he's developed a bit more, pull the trigger and get him to play in that potential double pivot.

De Bruyne, Foden, Rodri, Lavia, potentially Bellingham... Mad cohort.

And we're linked to Rice so it does seem like Pep wants that double pivot, so while we're at it I'd take Lavia over him because price. Rice is good too.",Manchester City,Yes,janp4lq,t1_janjalw
"I don‚Äôt believe it will happen because I don‚Äôt rate him at the level of Rodri, KDB, Gundo, Bernardo, David Silva, Dinho etc. Think about all the midfielders we‚Äôve had over the years. Really think about how great they have been. I‚Äôm talking players who not only started for City in the UCL but also in the World Cup for their national teams. Lavia is good but he‚Äôs not at that level.

Let‚Äôs see how things work out for him but I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs likely. Also, I wouldn‚Äôt put much stock in these transfer rumours since they‚Äôre rarely accurate. It wouldn‚Äôt be shocking if none of the clubs mentioned go for him.",Manchester City,Yes,janrshp,t1_janp4lq
"Have you watched Lavia? Ridiculous to think about whether he at their level, because his career has only just started.


Anyway, he's only 18 but his profile, pass selection, calmness under pressure etc. for that age are mad, no doubt he's going to be world class in his prime. Hard to be a standout in a team as a 6 and technically far above the rest at 18.",Manchester City,Yes,jaouepq,t1_janrshp
"I have seen him, and the way you‚Äôre describing him makes me wonder if you have tbh. No offense but you‚Äôre being a bit over the top.",Manchester City,Yes,jape8l9,t1_jaouepq
Nope I'm not. Rarely do I gush over young players. It's just that I do rate him that highly. Rare to find a 6 like him.,Manchester City,Yes,japhhee,t1_jape8l9

How much of the depth would you trust? Jones, Bailly, Lindelof, McTominay, Martial, Telles, Williams, Tuanzebe, Donny and Elanga aren't good enough.

Culture of failure is endemic. Glazers out. At least ten of those players out in the summer. Five really good signings plus Sabitzer and Wout for depth.

"Some personnel don't belong and they'll change so no point discussing that. Got a few other issues though.

1.	Bruno's behaviour was shocking yet not surprising. You need the captain to step up when you're losing. Every team looks good when winning. I think he'll become the captain next season but he needs to work on himself. Can't be behaving like a petulant child.
2.	Players lost discipline right after 2-0. That's just unacceptable. Shit happens. You concede early in the second half sometimes it's okay. Just keep your heads. Need to work on mental composure of the entire team.
3.	We desperately need another midfielder to control games. Somebody to slow or increase the pace of the game when we need it. We don't have anybody to dictate games in there and it hurts us. 
4.	Not unleashing Rashy on TAA was a very poor decision from EtH. So were his subs. Poor day for him.
5.	Train these players over the summer on how to pass under a press. Too many mistakes all the time. Not enough players good enough to play out of a press. Never gonna become a big team unless we can do that.",Manchester United,No,jb4b28e,t3_11jiacj

The fundamental balance in the team is still missing, and a lot of our players still make absolutely brain dead decisions instead of putting pressure on the other team by controlling possession.

I doubt Ten Hag is happy about this, and I want wholesale changes in the approach in the rest of the matches forward.

Some teams have unofficial rules where players let their PR teams run their socials completely due to the effect social media can have on their performance and moods and to maximise brand deals / avoiding saying random stupid shit.

One silver lining if you can call it that is that these are major flaws that need ironing out in the coming seasons if EtH wants his side to challenge, and these losses conceding so many goals will be something to ponder.

If we won the league we clearly would be overachieving, which would put way too much pressure onto next season (in terms of speculation, pressure to bring in players, etc). The development of this side needs to be progressive to be able to be consistent mentally playing at the highest level. Last night was a clear display that we don't have that tough mental consistency yet (some say perhaps a game too far with how many played, but that's hard to say).

Don't judge the team based off of one terrible result, because the 30+ other games weve played so far this season is a much better representation of where we are at. I care more about how we bounce back from this, and so far this season we have responded well after a loss.

Fred's been playing pretty great lately but I think that his goal contributions have kept Sabitzer out of the team and that ultimately our best 11 is going to exist in a world where we start Casemiro and Sabitzer together. Now it looks like Casemiro is injured and we'll still have to wait to see how they get on together.

I don't know why you would start Dalot over AWB in a game like this. Sancho should have come on, Rashford was isolated and he could have opened up space Antony wasn't. Prefer Wout in the role he's been playing before, if he's on the pitch Rashford should be on the left, not up top. It works well to take him off for Garnacho and let Rashford end the game as the striker, I'm not sure what ETH intended with the different Werghorst role.

This is Ten Hag‚Äôs biggest challenge imo. To get these players to give 120% on the pitch, not on days when we‚Äôre comfortably winning, but on days when we need the fight.

What I will say though, is it was a total freak match for most of this season to date. Everything went right for their previously non-clinical players (Nunez, Gakpo) and nothing went right for any of our players.

I don't like seeing everyone throwing their toys out of the pram today though. Yes, there are still signs of a worrying mentality in this team, in that when we lose, we lose big and fold. However, there have been a number of matches where that also wasn't the case and we have managed to come back and draw or win.

I'm of the opinion that ETH has shown he is good enough this season to have the faith of you all to bounce back over the next few matches. There is absolutely no point in going into total panic mode over this season because of one pathetic showing, especially when the previous 19 matches in the last 10 weeks have seen us win 15, draw 3 and lose just once (beating Barca and City in the same time-frame and winning our first trophy in 6 years).

Compare that with the 13 games  liverpool played in the same period, that's a third of what our boys have been through. It may not seem like a significant number but I think it does take a toil on the human mind and body at a top level.
Our buys need better mental fortitude and a some testicular ones too. The way they gave up after the 3rd and 4th goal was embarrassing.

In the razor's-edge system ETH has us playing, where a single mistake can unravel an entire sequence... it's a recipe for disaster. 

I'm not excusing Bruno's behaviour, but he acted almost literally the same as a toddler who needs a nap. His decision-making circuits looked fried. Burnout saps you of your willpower and fine judgement, letting emotion take the reins. I sympathise, but I wish he would have dealt with it better. He's overplayed and the club need to realise that. 

Responsibility for the massive loss? I think it's shared between the manager, the players, the chances of fate (Liverpool's insane chance conversion rate), the calendar ('suffering from success') , a little bit of everything.

He is like the worst player to have the ball in a counter attack. We had a 2v1 with him and Rashford and he waited for Rashford to be covered before making the pass... And if he is not playing a final shit pass, he is slowing the game down when it isn't necessary.

Plus our players played low quality attacks (minus Barca, who had injured players) for a period of time. Arsenal are still not in the same league and City had just 1 on target while trying to walk it in. This Liverpool is the most lethal frontline we have faced since the WC let's be real. Our players have been somewhat complacent at times and getting away with it recently, letting attackers take potshots knowing nothing would happen, add to that the tiredness and loss in concentration after too many midweek games. We have seen players getting tired after 40 minutes in the Carabao. 

We simply do not have depth to catch City. I hope Eth takes a very practical approach. We have just enough for a comfortable 3rd place finish. City, Arsenal, Liverpool, Spurs have to play one another bar a few here and there. There will be dropped points. We still have a couple arguably difficult games at St James's Park and Amex.

We seriously need to stop playing the same people every game. Bruno has played every game apart from when he was suspended. Rashford has almost started played in every game since WC. There are a few more. You are simply running these players to the ground. 

Rotate and give opportunities to the squad or just let it go. Ole tried it the next season and got knocked out of FA & Carabao almost immediately. We had so many games in the last two months and a lot more coming up. This is pretty much the issue with Liverpool, Chelsea and almost every squad except City. No one can consistently compete for all trophies every season until you have an amazing squad and we need to be realistic about that cause even if we win everything this season, we will crash and burn the next.

Just some really good last ditch defending prevented them from converting them. If not from the beginning, they really should have started defending deeper after the third goal and, once you gain possession, tried to keep the ball longer in buildups rather than doing whatever the hell they were doing going forward when they got the chance.

It feels like he relies on the wings and countering from the 6 line too much, whereas United rarely if ever asserts dominance in the center. Which they could. Especially given Sabitzers Red Bull pressing DNA, it kind of presents itself.",Manchester United,No,jb44r3d,t3_11jiacj

"The second half was a disaster as the players just gave up 10 minutes into it. Don‚Äôt really want talk about it, trust that ETH will fix that attitude. 

But our plan wasn‚Äôt good. We were playing fast attacks in transition with Bruno and Antony as wingers and Weghorst as CAM. While Wout was fine, we all know Bruno would perform way better from this spot, and Bruno himself isn‚Äôt a pacy winger who‚Äôs strong 1x1 to target TAA. So is Antony, if he has the ball in a counter attack, you know he will slow down and let the defender catch him. 

So the question is, do you think Weghorst performance justifies the fact we had to sacrifice Bruno and bench one of Sancho/Garnacho? I‚Äôd say fuck no. If we can‚Äôt score with him as CF, when the plan is to play counterattacks/fast transition, he should stay on the bench. ETH clearly favors him for the work ethic, but from technical point view he can‚Äôt produce even 25% of what Sancho/Garnacho can give us. We can‚Äôt always rely on Marcus to bail us out.

Weghoust, I praised him at first and it‚Äôs lovely to have a guy that presses. But he offers almost nothing else going forward.

Put Sabitzer on for Weghorst and move bruno to f9 and Rashford to the left. Crowd the midfield so that they would not have time and space to bring their front 3 into the game. This is how Newcastle managed to be in the front foot after going a man down against these lot.

Dalot needs to get his form back or risk his place in the team and if a player is not 100% fit he shouldn‚Äôt be played as it was evident with shaw and varane yesterday and also from the city drubbing

Yesterday was AWFUL, and I don't think anyone could quite believe what happened. But it was a mentality issue, not a talent or physical one. 

We have great players that have shown in the last few months that they are great players. We need to build on top of that of course (striker is the biggest obvious gap right now) but the winning mentality, discipline to stick to tactics and also removing lapses of concentration is what we need most - on top of having the patience with the Man Utd staff to instill that.

Seeing Rashford hit form, Weghorst being a nuisance, Dalot/ AWB stopping us from looking at RB options, Varane/ Licha being great has been a pleasure to watch in the past months, they are living up to the promise. Let's keep supporting them.

Swap Fred for Bellingham, Weghorst with Kane and Antony with Saka and we would of still have lost.

I'm also not sure it's as clear cut as people make out that AWB should have played instead of Dalot. Yes, Wan-Bissaka is in better form and Dalot like many others had a poor game.

Wayward, needlessly risky passes with no hope of reaching the target, constantly whining and moaning, kicking out at players, diving, laying hands on the officials.

Too painful to even do a full post-mortem on that but ETH had possibly his worst game, well definitely worst since the Brentford debacle. On current form AWB should definitely have started over DD, we really missed his tracking, tough tackling and aggression. He would have got under Nunez's skin just by beasting him. It wasn't a game for Wout at all, he may have his uses in games we dominate but he was lost here. To play Rashy up front against VVD and Konate when Trent has been struggling massively and was the obvious target off the left.  Such a blatant missed opportunity.

"18 games played by us to date in 2023, compared to 13 by Liverpool to date. While I do not condone the complete surrender that occurred yesterday, I think fatigue finally caught up with us, along with a combination of tactics employed sunday and lack of quality depth. Right now, our squad players aren't trusted by Erik to see matches out, as once again shown in the FA cup match. A common pattern has been to thrown on starters to see matches out when attempting to give some much needed rest. The squad isn't deep enough for 4 competitions, which makes the body of work put together by the boss to date even all the more impressive. 

2 losses in our 21 total matches since the campaign resumed, all things considered, the rebuild is on track, but this squad is not the finished product. What I do fear, is if the Glazers stay, and Ten Hag can't continue the rebuild how he wants in the transfer window.",Manchester United,No,jb5vnzo,t3_11jiacj
"Having watched the game again (was very painful), I am more than convinced it was a freak result. Every ball Liverpool were touching, they won.

I wouldn't be too worried about the result yesterday. I'd argue that before coming into this game there was no more 'in form team' than Man Utd. I watched some games with some beautiful football on show, it really felt like everything was going right for once.

Obviously the result was criminally embarrassing but the best thing about the premier league is that it's just one game and you can move on to the next. In terms of points (which is all that matters at this point of the season) the next game is worth just as much.

"Tbh 

I saw a heavy defeat coming, Newcastle and West Ham gave us hard games and Barca too but all 3 are not that great at the mo abd we just beat them.

We have literally played 2 to 3 games a week since the world cup and its showing and literally 4 of our players yesterday didnt look fit or had to pass fitness tests

Shaw Varane and another all had late tests tbh I think we shouldnt have played them. Maybe have played Malacia and AWB

ETH got it wrong yesterday and he knows it, dalot should not play now after that AWB should abd AWB would have neutralised alot of that wing.

Antony needs to be taught to track back and also to stay on his side of the field so many tines the last 4 matches ive seen him in the middle of the pitch your a winger mate.

Hopefully its a blip, today they are fucked and will porbably go through the hardest training session known to man.

We were never going for the title this year and some of our players gave up after seeing Arsenal and City win again.

Its shit we lost that way it really is but i pointed it out today.

Even in Sir Alexs golden years we got beat bad some times by Liverpool, City, Newcastle and for thr love of god we lost to Southampton 6-3.

To this day I am still more ashamed of the Newcastle and Southampton games, but this match does equal it.

Also this is not a moan, Liverpool spent money in the Jan window we had to loan.

THE sale has to go through now. Regardless of SJR or Qataris we need money investing into the team and its showing we need more good/better squad players

Also people need to be Sold, to me thats the nail in the coffin of Scott Mctominay, hes not Utd level never has been.

Dalot love the guy but since the world cup AWB has been the better player.

Fred has been immense but we saw the bad side yesterday, ETH really needs to start Betis with Casemiro and Sabizter 

Varane cannot play every game and it is showing now, he needs a rest same with Casemiro.

"I remember Jose in one of his lower key press conferences (and I think he was having a sideways dig at Pogba at the time as he'd just dropped him for McTominay) said he doesn't expect his players to be 10 out of 10s every week or even most weeks, but there is a minimum standard, where you have to at least do the basics so that you are walking off the field at worst a 6 out of 10 and not dropping all the way down to a 1 or 2 out of 10.

Shocking how many players were a 1/10 today.  Varane, Casemiro, Shaw, Licha, McTominay (when he came on), Bruno...  Some of those you really wouldn't expect it, others are walking on thin ice. 

DDG 1/10.  Even on a good day this man literally never does the basics.  Never has done. If he's not stopping shots he is a waste of space.  Like Pogba, pulls the wool over so many people's eyes, but not good enough.

Dalot, these 1/10s happens far too frequently with him.  Still young, but we need someone better.  

Fred, I dunno what to say.  His only redeeming quality is he works hard, and I respect that, I really do, but not good enough.  

As for Varane and Shaw, for experienced pros I expect so much more, and these aren't their first shockers so both walking on thin fucking ice if you ask me.  

Everyone else diabolical.  But I will give Bruno, Rashford, Licha and Casemiro a little bit of a break as they have been otherwise very, very, very good this season. 

I hope they all feel ashamed tonight, because to see a United team give up against Liverpool of all teams, to see professional pride not even kicking in at 4-0 is pretty fucking close to unforgivable.",Manchester United,No,jb30g4z,t3_11jiacj

1st goal: [https://dubz.co/video/9228d1](https://dubz.co/video/9228d1)

Watch Antony, the man was just watching our right wing getting completely exposed and didn't even attempt to jog back.

3rd goal: [https://dubz.co/video/2b356bAntony](https://dubz.co/video/2b356bAntony) fails to keep the player from advancing and after that he isn't even in the shot for the remaining of the video.

4th goal: [https://dubz.co/video/5cf3df](https://dubz.co/video/5cf3df)

Antony loses the ball and just lifts his arms and stays put. Doesn't even attempt to run back

6th goal; [https://dubz.co/video/34fdfd](https://dubz.co/video/34fdfd)

Where the fuck is Antony? Our right wing was completely exposed

7th goal: [https://dubz.co/video/a0c3cb](https://dubz.co/video/a0c3cb)

Watch Antony, he was past the half way line when the goal was scored.

"When Fergie went up against Wenger, we battered them several times.  They never battered us though.  Why?  Everyone knew the reason why.  Because we had a backbone and they didn't.  They didn't have that resilience when things went against them which is why they took many batterings from us, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, City etc and they lost to Chelsea every time they showed up. 

Recently we've been in the same position, taking many batterings because we don't have a backbone.  I thought maybe things were changing, but we've had a lot of false dawns since Fergie retired, and I'm still wary this might be another one.  The mentality of the team in the 2nd half was there in full show for everyone to see.  Team still needs open heart surgery, we have a scouting department that aren't fit for purpose, club run by buffoons, still rotten from top to bottom.

Then we have the prospect of the Qatari's coming in, maybe they pump obscene amounts of money in, but even if you can look the other way any victory will feel hollow, not earned, or the club gets saddled with massive debts and we're in the same predicament we're in now.

Today had ETH not stuck with him for long,
had he played Bruno in the middle Rashy as 9 and Garnaocho on left with Weghorst subbed, I am pretty sure TAA would be taken for a ride by Garnacho.

Sabitzer for Fred, AWB for Dalot were the subs that could have changed the tide.

I don‚Äôt know why ETH only uses Sabitzer to relace Case at times, he is a very potent midfielder who can replace Fred as well.

Goal 3: Starts from Bruno making a poor pass, then Licha gets rolled by Salah, Shaw does nothing to help

Goal 4: Antony with some awful control loses the ball and then just stops, Scott intercepts but the ball falls perfectly for Nunez who hits Scott again and it falls kindly to Salah.

Goal 5: Rashford has no interest in closing down the cross quickly and jogs, was never getting there, Nunez beats Varane in the air to a free header.

Goal 6: Elliot with acres of space down the wing, Sabitzer jogging and doesn't cut out the cross. Shaw makes an awful clearance and it falls straight to Salah at point blank.

Goal 7: Shaw can't get tight enough to cut out Salah's ball, DDG should have done better with the shot, Dalot was inside the goal and made a mess of clearing it off the line.

"Now that I recall yesterday with clear head, the whole match felt like a dream, I usually feel the team's efforts and chances but after half time I went numb. It didn't feel right. 
But now I am optimistic again. I'm not an expert but I felt like Ten Hag is trying to change they way we play against big teams, usually considering the managers we've had we park the bus and play on counter and this game looked like trying to play open game (it worked against Barca) and I respect Ten Hag for that, yes we could've parked the bus because we know how to, but trying this way looks like the right thing to me. Ten Hag said we should bring back the real Manchester of old and I hope it's the step in that direction. Remember when teams were afraid when we were on the ball? That was almost a lifetime away, but it's gotta change, look at Arsenal, I know it's hard to admit but they even made City play from counter, they made City play without possession. Yes the result wasn't theirs, but Pep surely didnt like not having possession and playing his boring ball. I hope we're going in the direction where we control the game even against strongest opponents, where they are afraid when we're on the ball. 
Trust in Ten Hag and he needs full backing, yeah we've spent a lot but this is MU we can spend a lot more hopefully after the debt is cleared.

"I‚Äôm still feeling physically sick and woke up this morning thinking it was a nightmare. We have had a tremendous turn around and achieved some fantastic things in a short amount of time under this first season but yesterday puts a wet blanket over it all for me to be honest. 

There are a lot of positives and I have no doubt in my mind that EtH is the right manager and we will be successful under him. I was prepared to loose eventually considering our good run of form and the intensive schedule and I would even have accepted 2-0 or 3-0 against the scousers but 7-0 and a performance like that? Sickening. 

I hope the players were called in early this morning and the team spends the day rewatching the game multiple times because that is one of the worst matches I‚Äôve seen as a United supporter. 

Some of the players really need to look at themselves because as EtH said that performance was unprofessional by players getting paid enormous amount of money to play football. Weghorst needs to be sent back after this season, I appreciate his work rate and all but he is a Championship caliber player. I also don‚Äôt get all the leniency in this sub towards Bruno, I love him and what he‚Äôs done for us but he has has a lot of games where he is poor. Just moping around and complaining and diving every chance he gets. His behavior yesterday was appalling, you are the captain of United and when the going gets tough it‚Äôs time to lead and he did not even remotely do that yesterday.

"New day and after I watched rewatch the game, I'm actually even more furious at the players. First half we performed well enough despite a goal down and I expected them to be more fired up and battle until the last whistle like they had shown post-World Cup. Except they didn't do that, they didn't do ANY of that. Instead we let our heads after a terrible start and just gave up. Liverpool keep parting our defence like the Red Sea and what's worse is they didn't try to break us down, we let them have the freedom of Anfield to do whatever they want. We made Gakpo and Nunez look like the second coming of Yorke and Cole and Salah once again own us with yet another time of his life against us.

I thought we stopped that bullshit but yesterday show there's still a lot of work ahead of us. Ten Hag got the the lineup wrong but what can he do when his players give up FIVE MINUTES into the second half? Some of the players exposed themselves as untrustworthy and embarrassed the fans, the manager and everything what Manchester United are about in that shambolic display. I don't wanna Werghost in a 10 role or Rashford upfront again. Dalot and Shaw are a sorry excuses for footballers, I'm convinced had AWB and Malacia started, we have still lost but with dignity and courage unlike these cowards who left our centre backs on No Man's Land. Less said about Bruno, the better. We need a captain who can rally his troops in the face of adversity and overcome the odds like Keane, Vidic, and Cantona not the type who throw his toy out of the pram like a petulant child. Our best player for three years straight but way too emotional and hormonal when the going gets tough.

Let's hope this was a one off and just a really bad day at the office. Such a result can affect the rest of the season which we can't afford to when we are still fighting for two remaining trophies. Ten Hag better get ruthless and whip them back into shape and demand the players to never perform like that again because this is by far the worst ever match in our history and to our most hated rivals nonetheless.

"Fair play to those who can move on from that result, 24 hours later and I remain completely disgusted. This one has really shaken me and my perception of the progress we've made. Not that I've written it off or anything, just it's put an obvious dent in it.

The collapse at 2-0 was just unbelievable, possibly the worst half of football I've ever seen. Ten Hag got so much wrong and deserves his share of culpability. I think that's what has shocked me most because the guy knows football, knows tactics and has had a really good first season in charge. Player wise, everyone embarrassed themselves. Some, like Antony, haven't really impressed me this season but I can accept it's his first season in a new league. Doesn't make the performance acceptable but I'm happy to give him time. Others have been at the club too long. I think for some that sort of vulnerable mentality will take too much effort to coach out, and of course the question about whether some really are good enough to play for Man Utd. Even those who've had a decent season were badly exposed yesterday.

Regardless of the outcome of this season, this one takes the shine of it significantly for me. It's worse that it came at Anfield, but our worst result in a century and tied worst ever loss regardless of who it came against is a terrible blight on the season and I hope will trigger some very serious considerations about who has the mettle to be at Old Trafford next season. Mentality is a hard thing to build and there are some who I suspect are very vulnerable in that side that, when it really comes to crunch time, will let us down.

So, yes, let's put things into perspective, shall we?

When I was a kid, I used to collect sticker albums and had several football annual year books.  Under each team, it would tell you their honours, the capacity of the stadium, who the secretary of the club was and all that kinda shit.  And do you know what else was listed?  Our record ever victory (for those who paid attention to that kinda thing you'll know it was 10-0 v Anderlecht when the Busby Babes played in the first round of the European Cup in 1956/57).  I wasn't born then, but records like that should be a source of pride for every United fan no matter what year you were born, particularly knowing what happened to that team 18 months later. 

But do you know what else was listed in these annual year books?  Our record ever defeat.  

That defeat against Liverpool is going to be permanently etched into the history books now.  That should be a source of shame for every United player that took part.  In the bit next to honours it will say, League Cup winners (1992, 2006, 2009, 2010, 2017, 2023).  And in the record defeat section it will say: 5th March 2023 Liverpool 7-0 Manchester United.  

Essentially the defeat is going to take up more real estate space in the record books than winning that silver trinket last Sunday.  Kids who are not even born yet will know about what happened yesterday. 

Everyone who took part yesterday has a permanent black mark next to their name. 
You let our most hated rivals do that to us.  You gave up.  It doesn't get worse than that.  In the olden days they used to put people in stocks and throw rotten eggs at them.  I'm starting to think they had the right idea. If we can celebrate them then why not?  If we can give DDG a ridiculous presentation for doing his job (and I wouldn't mind if he actually did his job, you know the basics like catching a fucking cross or coming out to sweep or passing it to someone who actually plays on the same team now and again) then why shouldn't they get the opposite?

And don't tell me you are sorry, I've heard it all before and it's just words, how about giving your wages back to the community, or volunteering your spare time this week to doing something meaningful?

"I saw many theories on what went wrong yesterday. From De Gea being outdated to Antony being shit, Bruno losing his head, our defenders having a stinker, our squad having a loser mentality,...

All of that is true to an extent. However, to me, the issue is exactly what has been plaguing us for YEARS and it's our midfield. Casemiro is obviously a world class DM but he seemed to be carrying an injury so he couldn't really cover ground. Combine that with Fred being half a midfielder even at his best because of his lack of defensive positioning and him running around like a headless chicken and you get a recipe for a disaster.

I'd argue we seemed the more dangerous side in the first half before we conceded but all was still fine. The issue came in second half when everyone lost their heads because injured Casemiro and Fred running around aimlessly meant we had zero midfield presence so literally any counter-attack Liverpool had resulted in them directly taking on our defenders. That's exactly what made us so shit last year, Fred-McTominay were always so non-existent that pretty much any ball through our midfield resulted in Maguire, Lindel√∂f and others getting exposed to 1v1s or 2v1s. Of course, the defenders sometimes win the ball, but no defender ever is going to be able to defend well with no midfield cover in front of him.

The solution? Not a massive clear-out, but a continuation of our midfield revamp. Casemiro is an amazing player and Eriksen is great, but Fred and especially McTominay don't have what it takes.

My question to Ten Hag would be why Sabitzer didn't start instead of Fred, especially if Casemiro wasn't at his best and Fred is known for being erratic.

I've never seen him as a legend because he fails in that one intangible area: a distinct lack of an aura. Or maybe it is tangible; he lacks personality. This manifests both in terms of a lack of ability to command his box verbally and an inability to impose himself physically such as claiming corners and crosses. It also manifests to the fans in that lack of connection that a lot certainly do feel towards him judging by 57% of fans saying they don't consider him a legend in a 2021 poll on RedCafe

Then we can factor in other weak areas of his game like massive inconsistencies between seasons and his appalling distribution. Schmeichel and Van Der Sar were both far superior goalkeepers 

Also I'm not blaming him for the performances in these games but being on the end of so many wallopings definitely affects his legacy

"few people out here blaming bruno asking to strip him off his captaincy, questioning his mentality.  lmao the flip flops are hilarious. Bruno is probably the only player in past 5 years who i would say has proven himself to deserve to play, When he was bought on in january transfer window he had instant impact, always hungry for goals, creating for others. Boosted other players. 

Forget about going so far in past, even this season bruno has been one of most flexible players for ten hag, we all know 10 is where he excels but he keeps switching so that ten hag and united can flourish, he has played left wing, right wing which clearly isnt his expertise. One bad game, one moment of disaster where he seemed to lose his head is reason to strip him off his captaincy ?

After this embarrassment, I wouldn't be surprised if ETH is going to need to start planning replacements for DDG, Shaw, Dalot, and Fred, in addition to replacements he's probably already identified for McTominay, Sancho, Maguire and AWB. Serious question marks will linger over Bruno as well, because he's played in almost every historic loss we've suffered in the last two years.

But of course, then we're just facing the same problem we've had for a decade. It's literally impossible to get rid of every perennial loser this club has in one go.

"Hairdryer + Constructive Criticism Incoming:

Yesterday was a wake up call to our most recent form, and ETH has to take the blame for starting Dalot, and in my opinion (I know many will disagree), sticking with this Weghotrst experiment that hasn't shown anywhere near enough good moments to convince me.  

Whether it be directly Weghorst's fault, or just his playstyle, (HIS ATTITUDE AND APPLICATION BTW ARE EXCELLENT I CANT FAULT HIM) ever since he came into the team, we haven't had a comfortable win. Think about it. Before with Martial/Rashford we were finishing teams off within 45 minutes, done, game over, onto the next one.......when was the last one of those games? They were becoming a regular occurance and I can't remember our last one? so YES, there has been a dip in form, but we have been grinding out results. Real talk. 

We have reverted back to trading blows with the other teams, think about how many CRUCIAL saves De Gea has had to make over the past 2 months to keep those scorelines at 0. Just remember how many hes made, before this slump in form, he wasnt having to make any.

Drew vs Palace, Drew vs Leeds, Lost to Arsenal, in these games we created close to no attacking chances because of this experiment, in my opinion. Also, in every one of these games, as soon as he came off, we looked so much better it was crazy. This wasn't in my opinion because of the genius of ETH substitutions, but more just that we took off the element causing us to not create chances. Sadly, again, I like the guy, just doesn't work, and we all saw the difference in play in each game. 

Secondly, Sabitzer has to come into this team, we are playing down how well this man has started for us. Bring back the pace, bring in the Austrian. Sabitzer- Cass with Bruno back in the 10. 

Also, please invest in clever fullbacks. Dalot is not good enough and never has been, Wan will never learn how to attack in the way we want im sorry, Shaw is a world class talent with a mind that error 404's on the regular, weve never signed a player there since Evra with the talent of a Cancelo/Robertson. That position could be levelled up easily. 

Believe in ETH, yes he made some mistakes yesterday, but I also believe fatigue was a big one yesterday, as soon as everyone saw the Cass had run out of energy it was panic stations, just like when he was sent off and the flood gates opened until Sabitzer came on and saved the day.

Bruno exceptionalism today ""If anyone should be given a pass on poor performances it's Bruno because he plays every game""

How hard is it to acknowledge that he lucked out by being the perfect player for Oleball 1.0. His skills are suited towards counter attacking football, not possession football. Ole tried playing possession football with him in the team last season and it was a disaster. Rangnick couldn't do it. Bruno can't even keep his preferred position under EtH. Is he trusted in the middle of the park? A Burnley striker who has 1 goal in 14 games has shunted Bruno out onto the wing. I don't think EtH rates Bruno as much as this sub does 

And when I say possession football I don't mean tiki taka, I just mean being able to hold onto and transition the ball in midfield and attack.

"Now that Ive sat down and cooled, im looking at everything and, while erik got things wrong, questions got to be asked of some of the players man. We thought Erik had changed the mentality, or in the very least, reinforced it from a bunch of beltway pansies from last season, clearly not, the underlying issues are still there

I get drubbings happen, but its getting too regular for us, and when you look at them all, you can point out, its the same players every single time. Most of our boys arent big game players, they're not mentally resilient. Good when the times are good, but when shit hits the fan, they fold. Bruno, as Captain, needs to rally the troops, make sure everyone gets a grip. He's the first to fall apart. Shaw, while technically proficient, loses his mind when it gets bad. 4 of those goals are on him. Rashford, despite being our goalscorer, cba when shit gets bad, wont press or track back. Dave is terrified to leave his six yard box, man shrinks further into it when it gets bad. Even our bench players, like scott, completely lose their minds and go on a GBH campaign.

I look at the Real Madrid mentality and ask, ""How tf do they do it?"". Even with a weakened side, when their backs are up against the wall, they don't fold, they get down, and go for it. Their CL campaign last season, even recently vs Liverpool, we'd fold if de gea fumbled like that...For me, Questions need to be asked of some of our players, especially some of the senior figures. When they need to step up, especially in big game situations, they fold first. 

This window, we need to look at 4-5 QUALITY FIRST team players, to push out, or even REPLACE some of these weak minded players out. Players who wont fold when it gets hard. Its easy to look good when its all working out.

"Awful loss, mainly for the fact that half the team completely gave up and stopped playing in the second half. I'll be generous and chalk it up to burnout from the fixture congestion and our lack of depth, but even conceding 7 we weren't as thoroughly outplayed as we were in either fixture against them last season.

That ""bang average"" Liverpool side still finished with 92 points last season, is on their best run of form all year, and hasn't conceded a league goal in over a month. I said almost a month ago that they're clear favorites for top 4 if they manage to win vs. Newcastle, and they did that without looking anywhere close to their best. They're peaking at the right time. Don't be surprised if they completely outplay Madrid in the second leg of their fixture.

Since Klopp took over in October 2015 we've scored a grand total of TWO goals at Anfield in the league (haven't scored one since December 2018) and won ONE game (in 2016 under LVG). We just had arguably the most intense period of our season with the two legged fixture vs Barca and the Cup final. It's not like we were expected to blow them out of the water. 

Because of Eriksen's injury at the hands of Andy Carroll's butchery, we've essentially had to rely on three players (Rashford, Casemiro, and Bruno) to do everything on the ball. They all played poorly and it showed. Erik ten Hag got the tactics wrong and we didn't have the quality off the bench to transform the game after going behind. 

The score line was exacerbated by some outrageously unprofessional defending and some unlucky bounces. In the first half we were equal if not the better team aside from the first 10-15 mins. Yes this game was awful, but it's nowhere near as embarrassing as the times we've been dominated more thoroughly over the course of 90 minutes. We've played matches where we were so shit that the other team legitimately stopped trying.

We're in the best position we've been in for years, are still 7 points clear of Liverpool and firmly in control of a top 4 spot (which many people thought unrealistic at the beginning of the season). It's going to take more than 3/4 of a season to get back on top under a new manager. The result is way worse on paper than in reality and it was against a team that still has the same core of players that had 97, 99, and 92 points in 3 of the past 4 seasons and made the CL final in 3 of the past 5.

This result isn't going to define EtH's tenure and isn't indicative of a collapse or anything like that. It was a ""perfect storm"" situation in the second half. THAT is why people don't have the pitchforks out. It was embarrassing, but we're still moving in the right direction and this isn't likely to become a habit.",Manchester United,Yes,jb32qz3,t1_jb2yo8d

Antony offers nothing in attack, and is the exact opposite of a Man United winger. Can't cross, can't pass, can't beat a man, always takes the same fuckin shot, has no right foot. He's not even one-dimensional, as that would imply he's actually really good at something.

His creative numbers are probably the worst of any RW in the league, and he's not a great ball carrier either. One assist in 27 games for a winger, just one big chance created as well.

He really isn‚Äôt even an awful player, playing more advanced or as a box-to-box, but fuck me he is not good enough for United even as a depth option. He was getting run past like he was stuck in fucking treacle, wasn‚Äôt showing for passes or protecting the defence.

Stay strong brother.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3i652,t1_jb3gf4e
"I would say you take a break and come back watching us. Its a game and don‚Äôt lose your mental strength to it. My friend who is from Madrid never watches football even though how successful Real is. I asked him why, he told ‚Äú22 millionaires are kicking a ball to increase their wealth and we all waste our time and money watching that‚Äù. Obviously its his opinion but don‚Äôt take things close to your heart. Take care and get well soon.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3iaq7,t1_jb3gf4e
"Antony doesn‚Äôt have a right foot, that‚Äôs why he can‚Äôt cross at all. I don‚Äôt understand how you can be a professional player and be less two footed than sunday league players. Like Antony and Luke Shaw.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3tacf,t1_jb3shb7
I just don‚Äôt understand how Weghorst keeps starting,Manchester United,Yes,jb3tcwz,t1_jb3shb7
"This lot need to go put on another 14km hike. Does not matter that we have a game in 3 days.

Running at least 10km per game is the bare minimum you expect from professional athletes. Heck, you pick 11 reasonably fit redditors in their 20s from this sub and they will run that much.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4p13n,t1_jb4m5c7
"same man, of course people are gonna make fun of us, it's just the game and we would do the same. Tbh we would make jokes about it for years to come so we can't really complain. You gotta laugh, because it really is laughable

People on here though are downright pathetic. All the good feelings and progress we've made seem to be forgotten, players get thrown under the bus, you might think we are sitting in 10th and playing shit football. I see it as a reality check, or rather a reality uppercut",Manchester United,Yes,jb4g51h,t1_jb4ebix

"There was a photo of him going around with Ighalo holding a MUFC jersey when he was here on loan.

If Qatar comes in, probably one of the first names on the shopping list.

I don't think we should pay Coutinho money for him but he's quality.",Manchester United,Yes,jb66a1q,t1_jb65ue8
Sad thing is we had more clear chances in that 6-1.,Manchester United,Yes,jb2ttyf,t1_jb2ta14
Do we have another interview or press conference? Where did you hear that,Manchester United,Yes,jb5h9tz,t1_jb5h37f
Robben was able to cut inside everytime cuz he was actually fast and strong. Antony sadly doesnt have dutchmans physicality.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6346p,t1_jb61ytu
"I think Antony will never be the winger people would (currently) like.

I think he's more of a movement off the ball winger, keep the ball rotating, than someone who takes on his man all the time. 

He's just not got the pace to be someone who can take on the fullback or get away from them all the time.",Manchester United,Yes,jb673uc,t1_jb61ytu
"He doesn't have the pace to get away from his man. It's weird cos he's clearly not slow, he just doesn't have the kind of pace that'll have him leaving defenders behind

Most of the time he gets away from his full back is because he cuts Infield and the fullback just leaves him for another teammate to bother with

3.4k upvotes for him ""toying with the Newcastle defence"". All I see is a player with infective dribbling",Manchester United,Yes,jb634tx,t1_jb61ytu
Many players have proven me wrong after I write them off but I suspect Anthony may not be able to improve much on taking his player. He will score goals with this curling shorts but I don‚Äôt see how he will get the confidence and skills to take on players other than what he is doing now.,Manchester United,Yes,jb645cv,t1_jb61ytu
Antony feels more like a great bench option than a starter for a top 6 club. Before we were interested in him I thought he was a good Raphina replacement at Leeds.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6d47h,t1_jb61ytu
"Thank u.

Been saying this for weeks we need good ball playing players who don't give the ball away easily.

Barcelona in their first leg rarely have the ball away in the midfield which was de jong-gavi-pedri-kessie.

Many PPL here praise Bruno a lot but he gives the ball away easily i get he is a good player but the reason he gives the ball away easily is why he disappears in big games.

Eriksen n casemiro r really good at ball retention.

Most teams nowadays use a 4 man midfield so we need players who don't give the ball away easily in mid plus our passing needs to improve a lot.",Manchester United,Yes,jb713rs,t1_jb6y10g
"Yep, Thursday will be the litmus test to see if our mentality has changed. I‚Äôm weirdly confident though, I think, as happened last time, Ten Hag is capable of motivating the team to bounce back from terrible losses

Long term it is absolutely essential we rid ourselves of this terrible capitulation mentality when we play good sides however, otherwise it will always be a spectre hanging over the players when we get far in the League or Europe.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2sm3h,t1_jb2s4g2
They have an incredibly tough schedule ahead. I'd be surprised if they took points off both City and Arsenal,Manchester United,Yes,jb2wnx4,t1_jb2twpr
"A captain should never ever ask to be subbed off unless they are injured. *Yet alone* during an absolute humiliation. Shows how piss poor of a leader he is. This just embodied everything wrong with his attitude and frankly it‚Äôs still a rot in the core of the team. Plays for himself not the club, loses his head when things don‚Äôt go his way. 

I‚Äôm glad ETH has got rid of sidelined the biggest issues but I do doubt him when he makes Bruno captain, it‚Äôs just such a terrible decision.",Manchester United,Yes,jb36q5i,t1_jb33sa6
"Didn't he literally just say in an interview a few weeks ago he hates being rested? That 2-3 games a week is nothing for him because he used to play for hours every day as a kid?

I think he just fully lost his head today, his antics were OTT even by normal Bruno shithousery standard. He wouldn't have been asking to be subbed off if we were winning, thats for sure.",Manchester United,Yes,jb38jn2,t1_jb33sa6
No this will stick no matter how the season ends. It's been 12 years and we still take the piss out of Arsenal for that 8-2. We have to live with that.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3cflz,t1_jb3bqux
"People are too emotional. We don't need to extend Weghorst at all. He has scored 1 goal in 14 games. Come on man be real that isn't even good enough to be a backup at this club. Look at the numbers of Nelson, Firmino, Nketiah, Alvarez etc. The backups of other top clubs in the league.",Manchester United,Yes,jb45cco,t1_jb4451r
"Finally people see this, if a st is so bad u have to play him in midfield then do u even have a ST?",Manchester United,Yes,jb46don,t1_jb4451r
"Bruno was put on left wing so Weghorst can be utilized as CAM and Antony as RW. 

While we can appreciate Weghorst work ethic and he surely contributes, but ffs he‚Äôs not a caliber of player to sacrifice Bruno‚Äôs best position and of Sancho/Garnacho to start as actually LW",Manchester United,Yes,jb4ch3q,t1_jb4cb1v
He will be out after one or two games after that. We need to get a striker in summer.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4cz8b,t1_jb4cqhe
Loooks like ETH rates Elenga more than Pellirstri given Swede sits on the bench and Uruguayan not.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4d036,t1_jb4cqhe
Antony shouldn't fucking start. Absolutely useless player 99% of the time. The most predictable winger I've ever seen,Manchester United,Yes,jb4e2oo,t1_jb4cqhe

"My reactionary ass would run this for the next two game

De Gea, AWB, Martinez, Varane, Malacia, Sabitzer, McTominay, Sancho, Rashford, Elanga, Pellistri.

Ideally Casemiro plays but if he actually injured",Manchester United,Yes,jb5i2gq,t1_jb5h8jl
that sub genuinely has less ball knowledge than football twitter also can‚Äôt stand the united flairs on their that twerk for rivals and karma,Manchester United,Yes,jb6k24n,t1_jb6gaej
It'll never happen.,Manchester United,Yes,jb47l55,t1_jb369pc
"I would add another CB to the list, Varane is being overplayed and the other options aren't good enough",Manchester United,Yes,jb4eeyi,t1_jb4e6wr
"A right back is a completely unnecessary transfer target. Dalot and AWB are more than good enough. Dalot when healthy is an excellent player.

Keeper also is not a priority over positions like centre mid. We don't have 70m to go spend on Diogo Costa or something when we need potentially 2 strikers, multiple midfielders and a centre back",Manchester United,Yes,jb4et0s,t1_jb4e6wr
"Yes, we win in the smallest way imaginable.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4ksgi,t1_jb4jlqm
"Yeah. I was pretty numb yesterday, but I'm back to being more optimistic this morning. I'm not discounting the progress this team has made in the last six months, even if it's obvious we still have a long way to go.

From now on,  I'm going to consider giving Liverpool a kicking at Anfield to be the final boss for Ten Hag's rebuild. I look forward to seeing it happen.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4k9pm,t1_jb4k1kp
Because last season's horror shows weren't isolated incidents. You just knew that the 5-0 thrashing at Old Trafford was just an appetizer for what was to come after. This one though was textbook Murphy's law. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Surprised we didn't pick up a red and an injury because it was that sort of day..,Manchester United,Yes,jb4kb15,t1_jb4k1kp
To accommodate Weghorst. Hope that result makes him drop that experiment now.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4vy42,t1_jb4vswb
"When was the last time in the PL that a big money signing winger worked out? Grealish is doing okay, not living up to his price tag. Pepe from Arsenal was a huge flop. Maybe the sweet spot is getting medium priced wingers lol. Worked out for Liverpool",Manchester United,Yes,jb5g8x5,t1_jb5e13g
"I think Sancho still has a better chance of turning thing around based on his Dortmund days, but maybe I am just on hopium.

Antony is a weird case though. There is so much wrong with his game that it is insane. He plays how I would expect Garnacho to be playing. It is not impossible for him to turn it around, but I have very limited expectations.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5ifkc,t1_jb5e13g
Desperately begging for Harry Kane at this point. Perfect striker for our needs imo.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6fz1h,t1_jb6dd90
"No it won't.

Our wingers bar Sancho don't create anything for our forwards most games.

Even if we had Haaland he'd struggle.

May end positional roulette but if your wingers are interested more in shooting than creating then a CF isn't going to do anything.

**Expected assists:**

Sancho: 44th percentile

Rashford: 25th percentile 

Garnacho: 22nd percentile

Antony: 3rd percentile

**Key passes :**

Sancho : 94th percentile

Antony: 16th percentile

Rashford: 12th percentile

Garnacho:  1st percentile",Manchester United,Yes,jb6i4ro,t1_jb6dd90
"The optimism of a few fans really just went off the charts the last week or so. Most of our fans were tempering expectations to an extent but the ‚Äòimpervious title charge‚Äô comments that started to pop up were very premature. I think our fans (me included) just really miss and are pining for even a hint of us challenging for the PL in a weird year.

Just shows, no matter how shit our rivals seem to be they are always a massive threat. Pissed me off though that we probably kickstarted Liverpool‚Äôs return to some sort of form just like they did for us earlier in the season.

Oh well, we go again. Still in for 2 Cups. 1-3 Cups and 3rd? I‚Äôd have bitten your hand off for that at the start of the season.",Manchester United,Yes,jb364sj,t1_jb35ifr
I would follow EtH to war. I don‚Äôt care if he wants an entirely new 25 man group next season.,Manchester United,Yes,jb5kiij,t1_jb5h4qg
Look at all the maulings we received last few years and see what players were a part of each one. It‚Äôs not a coincidence.,Manchester United,Yes,jb5hjtd,t1_jb5h4qg
Totally agree. I‚Äôm with EtH all the way. If he decides to stick them all in the U21s I back his decision,Manchester United,Yes,jb5n6jm,t1_jb5h4qg
"For me it's a combination of a lot of factors. I personally think that the previous years   
and managers that were horrendous still play a part in everything. A lot of these players played under Mourinho, Solskjaer and Rangnick which were all bad and I'm sure the bad mental strength that these players have is still up to the coaching from the previous managers. Imagine playing for 2 years under Ole. There are players that probably weren't even properly coached for those two years and they still play for us to this day. Can you imagine how much experience they lost in that time? Also, we can of course thank the Glazers because they too set up Ten Hag for this moment, because they refused to buy the players he wanted, which forced him to overplay most of the current squad which in turn leaded to this horror show. I'm sure if Qatar buys the club and give Ten Hag a blank check we'll be looking at a very, very different team next season. So people need to look the broader picture and get too sad with this result, because the difference between losing last year to Liverpool and this year is that now we can actually see a clear direction, so I got my hopes up for next season. I think we can do a lot with this manager",Manchester United,Yes,jb60hxe,t1_jb5h4qg
"Yep. Resistance has come from now ETH has transformed the team completely and so has gained a lot of favour. 

But he got it wrong today and it‚Äôs okay to say that. The lineup was experimental and it did not work. That doesn‚Äôt mean anyone‚Äôs Ten Hag out, fuck that, this is the most positive I‚Äôve felt about the club since Fergie. However he‚Äôll know he made important mistakes in that match, just like the players.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2vkub,t1_jb2uuk9
Yup.. he will learn too. It was frustrating to see Bruno on LW when you have two wingers on the bench. Nobody saw this result coming and the players showed they still need more time to not capitulate.,Manchester United,Yes,jb2wgy9,t1_jb2uuk9
"Tbf, the Weghorst no 10 'bullshit' worked against Barcelona and he has been awful as a no.9.

Lot of things to blame ETH for today, but given how he has been hung out to dry with his options upfront, this is not one of them.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3tgcb,t1_jb3spjl
People have been calling him a flop all season. Stop this,Manchester United,Yes,jb4dw8g,t1_jb4cqsx

"My coworker is a Liverpool fan, and I gotta see him tomorrow. Fuck me.",Manchester United,Yes,jb340qf,t1_jb30edu
It‚Äôs baffling we spent 100M on a winger who can‚Äôt even do that ü§¢,Manchester United,Yes,jb469um,t1_jb45z3w
Normally it helps getting an espresso and a good book to cheer me up in the day...i just stared out the window sipping that cold coffee thinking about the score :(,Manchester United,Yes,jb5p07l,t1_jb5n2sb
"What pissed me off was seeing players fraternizing with the Liverpool players after that humiliating loss.

Call me old fashioned but you only get to do that if it was hard fought match.

If you get your ass handed to you, either run to the showers or apologize the away fans and then run to the showers.",Manchester United,Yes,jb66xvl,t1_jb642sv
just remember football is just lads kicking a ball,Manchester United,Yes,jb31w87,t1_jb30pql
I'd imagine most people on this sub have realised it's all PR agencies at this point. I miss the glory days of twitter when players obviously tweeted for themselves but it's become PR central so I don't even look nowadays,Manchester United,Yes,jb37k37,t1_jb379zo
This is pretty much all companies and many celebrities these days. My wife works in PR and social media is a skill set/ job role (to write in someone else‚Äôs voice),Manchester United,Yes,jb387ow,t1_jb379zo
"We need to have a proper response, having done a round of the subs I need to get off the internet. We are a laughing stock and everyone seems to be loving it",Manchester United,Yes,jb3wgbj,t1_jb3vy2v
Who cares? Ronaldo is basically retired.,Manchester United,Yes,jb502wt,t1_jb4zv62
"If Ronaldo was still starting every match we'd be in the bottom half of the table fighting a relegation battle, and his fanboys would be saying Ronaldo is the only thing stopping us from being bottom of the league. 

They're demented, everyone of them, they follow the individual and not the team which is why they don't understand football.  It's like me trying to understand chess by focusing on the rook and barely paying attention to all the other pieces.",Manchester United,Yes,jb51dxt,t1_jb4zv62
And I hear my local pub team won 11-2 at the weekend so I guess I should be jumping for joy.,Manchester United,Yes,jb59izk,t1_jb58gcu
"Knives all out in the media for Bruno today thanks to him going on about something that he had no proof of happening.

Man's had a stinker.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6ahwi,t1_jb65xsg
"We responded well after being beaten by City, and after losing to Villa. Granted, this loss was a magnitude worse than either of those, but I expect a similar reaction.

Ten Hag won't accept sulking or moping, or negativity, and I don't believe Casemiro, Varane, Martinez etc will either. There are still some mentally fragile players at the club, so we'll have to watch for how they react, but I have faith that the team as a whole will bounce back quickly.

We need to beat Betis and then, hopefully, thump Southampton to get back on a roll.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4j10z,t1_jb4iqdq
"Im literally devastated. Slept like shit, haven't been able to get any work done today. Feels like shit man",Manchester United,Yes,jb40wru,t1_jb40lme
Wasn‚Äôt Gerrard sent off after like 38 seconds against us?,Manchester United,Yes,jb44860,t1_jb43hcz
"It's definitely the sort of 'outsmarting yourself' thing that Pep likes to do. Sometimes (a lot of the time, actually) in football, it's better to just say, 'they know we're going to do this, but we're better than them and they can't stop us.' That should have been the thinking with Rashford vs TAA yesterday.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4guoo,t1_jb4gmvx
Weghorst played as 10 because we don‚Äôt score in fast attacks when he‚Äôs CF. The question is why tf he has a default place in starting lineup when he‚Äôs neither our best CF nor best CAM,Manchester United,Yes,jb4hovs,t1_jb4gmvx
"I think it's more a case of Ten Hag having to shoehorn whoever's fit to play into whatever position because the whole first team is shattered. If he decided Rashford was too tired to run up and down the flanks for 90 minutes but could probably do a less demanding job upfront, that would make sense given how many games we've played lately. We need a lot of new squad options this summer.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4h1lb,t1_jb4gmvx
I agree however unfortunately liverpool have won the most trophies,Manchester United,Yes,jb4oa07,t1_jb4np33
"We don't concede more than 4 goals yesterday if we had Alisson in goal. De Gea makes great saves for the cameras but totally inefficient. Doesn't command the box, doesn't claim crosses, doesn't sweep, poor on the ball, poor in 1v1s and literally a below average shot stopper as evident in the stats.

He saved us till 2018 no doubt, but after that he has been a liability. Klopp came in replaced Mignolet with Karius and when it didn't work out replaced him with Alisson. Pep replaced England's number 1 Hart with Bravo and when it didn't work out got Ederson. 

None of the top managers compromised for their number 1, so I know Ten Hag won't either.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6705r,t1_jb65u6u
"He needs to be replaced but it‚Äôs at the bottom of the list imo. Midfielders, a new striker and a Maguire replacement are the top priorities. Then I‚Äôd probably say a new keeper   Unless Qatar buys us soon and we can have a Chelsea like summer window it may be hard to do it all in one summer",Manchester United,Yes,jb6iy9r,t1_jb65u6u
He needs replacing in the summer,Manchester United,Yes,jb6ehhf,t1_jb65u6u
"We're paying DDG ¬£375,000 a week and he can't do the bare basics of his job.  Let that sink in, ¬£375,000 per fucking week.  This club!

Not even 3rd choice for Spain.  Mentally weak, physically puny, can't catch a cross, can barely pass to a teammate, gets a nosebleed if he leaves his line, and is about as brave as my sausage dog... yeah he's a legend alright, a legendary bloody fraud. 

It would be a sickening blow if he's given a new contract at even a tenth of what he is earning now.",Manchester United,Yes,jb68uq0,t1_jb65u6u
"i think the problem is the complete opposite compared to Brentford, we‚Äôre absolutely drained physically that as soon as the goals started leaking, we collapsed mentally, we‚Äôve played so many games, making them run is just going to make upcoming fixtures worse

put them in a room, put the game on, make them rewatch it 7 times",Manchester United,Yes,jb2re0n,t1_jb2qy31
Guys Brazilian and players like Dan burn has got him figured out FFS,Manchester United,Yes,jb4dfyy,t1_jb4d689
"I've already seen enough of Antony, get rid. I'd rather play Pellistri at this point, at least he can beat a man and whip in a cross. That first half chance where a simple ball across would've released Rashford yet he messed it up. He's probably the least creative winger at club, just a glorified ball recycler at this point. No cutting edge, teams don't have to worry about him.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4djjw,t1_jb4d689
"I have to agree with you.
The problem is is that there are so few left-footed right-wingers in the market, let alone any of them that are quality.
Last summer there was literally him, Raphinha and Asensio that were available, out of players that are 'known' quantities in Europe.
Raphinha rejected Chelsea for Barca so I don't think we were really in with a shout for him, especially because he was ex-Leeds.
I remember there was talk of Asensio but from what I've read, ETH wasn't that keen on him.
In hindsight, I wish we had got someone like Kulusevski the summer prior.
He doesn't seem that fast when I watch him play for Spurs but he's very direct and is waaay more two-footed than Antony is.
He also seems to have a much higher football IQ and makes better decisions about passing options.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4fgt2,t1_jb4d689
"He was 80 mln acutally. 80 mln nowdays gets you players like Antnony Sancho or Mudryk so no way we sing anyone better for 50mln

Not like im deffending Antony but thats how it is in market.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4djop,t1_jb4d689
I hate this take. Just a scapegoat. The price tag is not his fault. He scores goals for us. If you want a scapegoat for yesterday have a look at Dalot. Was he even playing?,Manchester United,Yes,jb4h7pk,t1_jb4d689
"Someone needs to make a spreadsheet of all the starting lineups and subs that have been involved in all these games. The only player off the top of my head I can think started all these is DDG. From the current squad, I think McTominay, Shaw, Fred, Fernandes and Rashford will feature a lot in these lineups too. Maguire and AWB might be in some too but they didn‚Äôt play yesterday.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5awzp,t1_jb5aiyl
People calling this a freak result does my head in. What's frekish is the consistency of these batterings. We've been proper shite at times since 2013 but this never used to happen until recently.,Manchester United,Yes,jb5ay0h,t1_jb5aiyl

"It was unprofessional 100%, another ref could have easily given a red card.

"Sabitzer, AWB and Malacia needs to play. 

I love Shaw, I think he can do with a little protecting after this. Just take him out of the firing line for a bit. It was embarrassing. Not saying he shouldn‚Äôt be critiqued, but this can mentally derail your season. 

Maguire probably starts. If there‚Äôs anytime you need your club captain to step up, it‚Äôs now? 

The WW #10 experiment needs to stop. It threw the opponent defense off for the first few times but now it‚Äôs got found out. 

Also. 

Sabitzer needs to start. Sabitzer needs to start. Sabitzer needs to start.",Manchester United,Yes,jb48ja1,t1_jb47w7v

"I don‚Äôt think it was worse than last season. Last season was fucking horrific. Yesterday was just shocking. I still felt like the players cared yesterday, but just lost their heads after feeling a bit hard done by with the two goals either side of half time. Similar to what happened to Leicester at Old Trafford. We stung them with a Rashford goal and then they just fell apart.

"I understand people saying we have to move on, next game etc etc, but I just cannot accept this 0-7 man. Its not even the first time we've been battered this season.

"Its football mate, its okay to be invested, but probably not to the level of it affecting your mental health and thus your overall health.

Theres a new game on thursday, then a new game three days later, and so forth. This will sting, but great new moments will happen and help with alleviating the pain. Things will get better because of ETH. I think we can allow ourself to give him that trust because of the season thus far.

I've been saying this months mate he's honestly average at best. Antony is the kind of winger you'd expect at a club like Everton not us,Manchester United,Yes,jb4e6dw,t1_jb4e34m
"I wouldn't mind if we'd paid ¬£40m for him, but ¬£90m was crazy money. For that, you want an instant gamechanger. He could develop into one, but so far he's more like Dirk Kuyt with the ability to curl a nice left foot shot.

He's scored some important goals, but he needs to be more consistently involved and more consistently effective.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4efpq,t1_jb4e34m

Weghosrt, Antony has way bigger margin for error/mediocre performances than Jadon/Garnacho or even never utilized Pellistri. They shouldn‚Äôt start in the games when we‚Äôre not going to control the possession and rely on fast attacks. And he should‚Äôve reacted in half time, not waiting for us to fall behind even more.

Bruno was non-existent on the left wing. Why not try playing four in midfield against top teams and stop them dominating the middle of the pitch? They were streaming forward in massive amounts of space whenever they wanted.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3gcwq,t1_jb3fahd
"The midfield issue could have been solved today if ETH could have taken precautions, you are away to Anfield that you hav not win or even scored any goal in many years.

"We need to drop Bruno and play with Sabitzer there, you‚Äôre right. Weghorst as a striker (because we have no one fucking else), Rashford on the left and Sancho on the right (Antony needs to be dropped after this performance).

Malacia in for Shaw and AWB in for Dalot. Varane and Martinez need to stay, I still have faith in them as I do in Casemiro. Casemiro needs a rest though but his sub is McTominay so Casemiro plays almost all the time every game.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3cidb,t1_jb3c31u
"That was one of few concerns Ajax fans were telling us about him, he plays same players untill he hit annuall bad spell.

Most of them argue he wins more games this way anyways so I will wait more than one season to judge his strict first XI policy.",Manchester United,Yes,jb684bq,t1_jb67kjy
"I hate this narrative but who does he rotate with? We rotated against west ham 3 days ago and showed why he doesn't want to rotate. The squad depth is the bare bones of quality and you expect united to be in all competitions. It doesn't work like that my friend. 

It's same nonsense I hear with Wout and why he doesn't replace him. Because there is no player that can play striker there as the other striker is always injured. 

I get it, we lost badly yesterday but blaming others without reasoning will get us no where. 

You could see this defeat was coming (not 7-0 though) with the way our schedule is from end of december. The last 4 games were barca (W), newcastle (won trophy), west ham (W) and scums which we lost. What do you expect is going to happen with this squad? Win every games till the end of the game whilst playing a game after 3 days? Be more realistic.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6am81,t1_jb67kjy

I get it, it was humiliation but get ur head in right place. Ten hag has us set on right path players looked passionate and hungry for wins, something we haven't seen for many years.

It's not a freak result. They beat us 5-0 at OT last season. We shipped 6 to City and 4 to Brentford this season. This team capitulates at times and it should be acknowledged,Manchester United,Yes,jb63fy3,t1_jb5zh7j
"As I said on another post, I hope the players are dreading heading to the office today, as much as I am",Manchester United,Yes,jb40wgh,t1_jb3zmg2
It‚Äôs why I‚Äôm fine with moving past DDG. in my opinion he doesn‚Äôt have a winners personality. There is a reason he doesn‚Äôt play for Spain and a reason he‚Äôs been involved in so many humiliating losses. He‚Äôs good at the reflex stuff but he has a weak mentality and crumbles too easily,Manchester United,Yes,jb4srzk,t1_jb4ru3a
He‚Äôs 29 in September,Manchester United,Yes,jb3e9pk,t1_jb3culd
"He‚Äôs 28. I agree. In terrible situations when it‚Äôs all going sideways the captain absolutely needs to have a bit about him and I‚Äôm also getting tired of this petulant child mode he gets into. People will dismiss it as ‚Äúpassion‚Äù or ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt like to lose‚Äù but I grew up watching a couple of players who wore the armband at this club who those attributes would have equally applied to and they never ever acted like they just wanted to go home with their ball because life was hard on them one day. 

That was disappointing to see amidst all the other disappointing things.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3h1bt,t1_jb3culd
"I don't know if he was asking to be subbed off, that was Gary Neville's interpretation and everyone seems to have gone with that interpretation.  From memory I think he waved his hands in the air seemingly towards the bench when Rashford got taken off, although everything from yesterday is getting a bit cloudy to me, so I could be mistaken

I mean maybe he was looking for instructions from the bench but didn't get them, or maybe he did want to leave the field, but then maybe he had good reason to, maybe he was carrying an injury, or maybe we've completely misinterpreted his gesture, and maybe it wasn't even towards the bench?  Who the fuck knows.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4z5w6,t1_jb4x2hm
He asked who was getting subbed off.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4zaxv,t1_jb4x2hm
"The most cavani like player right now would surely be Valencia striker... Edison Cavani :)

Joking aside, I agree with the other response, I have been saying all season despite him misfiring in front of goal, Nunez is gonna be an absolute weapon once he sorts out end product. 

Looks tailor made for the PL, big, strong, fast, gets in good scoring positions either from the left or playing centrally, just finishing is lagging but he is still on 13 for the season now",Manchester United,Yes,jb5hr88,t1_jb5gdki
They had 7 goals from 8 shots on target with 2.3 xG. But the players' downing tools made it worse. It was never a 7-0 game.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6p4fr,t1_jb6o3ws
"Cheers mate. It had been trending down for a few weeks to be honest, we were due a loss because fatigue and games were piling up. This though..this was complete capitulation and won‚Äôt be forgotten. For example you guys would never let yourselves be beaten by a fellow top 6 team 7-0, we‚Äôve had 4 or 5 of these similar blowouts the past 2 seasons. 

Top 4 was always the goal though, we‚Äôre all in for the long haul with Ten Hag.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3bpfq,t1_jb3b2qe

Bruno legit acted like a petulant adolescent today who just wasn‚Äôt getting his way. And I heard Gary Neville said he asked to come off towards the end? Seriously what kind of captain is he? They need to strip him of the armband. He was no captain today. Arguable the worst player on the pitch. I get he‚Äôs played the most minutes this season but still,Manchester United,Yes,jb33yo1,t1_jb30g4z
to be honest we lot celebrated arsenal going down 2-0 to bournemouth. Its just natural to celebrate at misery of ur rivals specially when it comes to arsenal and united its totally understandable,Manchester United,Yes,jb44mpy,t1_jb43vyp

"I hope after this game ETH realizes Antony‚Äôs shortcomings. Which are a lot, considering he‚Äôs one of the starters. He can‚Äôt just keep defending him match after match like this.

Hopefully this summer ETH puts him in an intensive crossing/ dribbling training or something.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4xdjq,t1_jb4ss1q
"He hasn't. Simple as that.

>What was he not doing in August that he's doing now?

He's trying his signature left foot curl up shots even more often. He's also become more annoying with his childish aggresion, pointless dribbling attempts. I don't know about this guy anymore.

The only thing going for him are few improtant goals he's scored.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4x13i,t1_jb4ss1q
"No one justifying that fee, he's good player but we overpaid, but it's not his fault.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4urqj,t1_jb4ss1q
"For a player who is usually praised for working hard out of possession, this HAS to be instruction. ‚ÄúStay high so you can attack the space behind Robertson on the counter‚Äù. That‚Äôs all I can think.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4wyr4,t1_jb4w0fw
"I was just going to come back and comment about him. I was angry about the 1st goal but after reading Ducker‚Äôs analysis of the goals he is also the main culprit for the 4th goal as well. Loses the ball and standing still watching is unforgivable.

He is among the worst players yesterday imo, considering he added nothing to the attack, as his main responsibility requires.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4wsvg,t1_jb4w0fw
"There was also a counter attack where antony was on the left and needed to cross the ball in or play it through for rashy and he super casually plays it straight to I think konate. There was no urgency, no desire, no hunger, playing like its a friendly or something. Then a sheepish smile like ah one of those things. Meanwhile gakpo on the other end completely the opposite. Anyway not like he was the only one who played shit yesterday, can't exactly single him out",Manchester United,Yes,jb4y7y7,t1_jb4w0fw

"Let's ignore the moral implications for the sake of argument.

There is no guarantee that spending money leads to success, see PSG. Despite no other team coming close to a fraction of their budget, they still manage to lose the league twice. And their CL record is atrocious.

Arsenal don't have unlimited money, and looks like they will win the league this season.

So let's stop pretending that Qatar would save us. We make enough of our money to compete well. What's needed is a good organizational structure and decision making, that's the real problem",Manchester United,Yes,jb5f91o,t1_jb564co

But that should've been obvious. We were nowhere near a top top level club and Liverpool have showed this to us to maximum effect 3 times over,Manchester United,Yes,jb6a5d6,t1_jb69lpt
I remember watching that game and that was another freak result. Every shot Aston villa had went in along with so many deflections. Very very similar.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6o95f,t1_jb6lw41
Out of all players Bruno should be given a pass on poor performances. Look at his minutes compared to every one else. He plays every minute of every game. He needs to be rotated out but we have no one who can cover for him right now,Manchester United,Yes,jb53c0l,t1_jb50hj1
Imma be honest im not a huge fan of bruno as a player or person but i try to be as fair as possible with him but yesterday was a major disgrace honestly. Like you said if it was maguire there'd be a massive dingdong about him doing this,Manchester United,Yes,jb51pxu,t1_jb50hj1
"Any measured criticism of Bruno gets instantly downvoted on here and then you get accused of having an agenda against him which leads to personal abuse (I once had someone go through my Reddit history to bring up something non football related because I was critical of him). The only times you can criticise him on here and get away with it are the times shortly after getting trounced 

He'll revert back to his XX goal contributions in XX games after a while and will once again become a demigod on here because so many modern football fans lack the nuance to understand there's way more to being a good footballer than racking up goals and assists. Even at his best he's unbelievably overrated",Manchester United,Yes,jb53ztg,t1_jb50hj1
"It's incredible that a player who doesn't even do the bare basics of his job, like catch a fucking cross, or come out and sweep or pass to one of his teammates once in a while, has lasted 10 years at this club.  And people call him a legend?  What a sad indictment for this club.

If you don't do the basics and you aren't stopping shots, then you are basically a spectator, you are a zero out of ten.  In fact you are worse than a spectator, because at least a spectator makes a bit of bloody noise.  

You can't have a player in the team who is going to be producing multiple 1/10 performances during the season.  Sure, he'll have the odd day where he makes some great camera saves, but then Pogba had some great days too, I think he got 4 assists in one match, but he was a waste of space too.  

Want a consistent team?  Then find consistent players who at least have the fundamentals to fall back on, and won't be dropping down to a 1 out of 10 multiple times a season.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5gg9j,t1_jb5djq1
"Because there's other position that in dire need of upgrade and backup. We still don't have clinical striker, Martial get injured all the time and Weghorst can't finish to save his life. Our midfield depth is horrible, Casemiro is great but he will get knackered for playing each game possible. 

If we solve this two positions first, then we can talk about replacing De Gea",Manchester United,Yes,jb5evrf,t1_jb5djq1
If this is another false dawn i genuinely don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll cope,Manchester United,Yes,jb4x54v,t1_jb4vrcb
"Hindsight is 20/20. Fred was in white hot form previously, Sabitzer hadn‚Äôt really played as a duo with Case and so not worth throwing him in for the first time at Anfield against Pool. 

Ten Hag thought we‚Äôd need the legs of Fred to win the midfield battle and I understand why he started him, Fred was really not great today though. 

Wish Sabitzer had had some more playing time with Case before this match",Manchester United,Yes,jb2s6qr,t1_jb2rahj
"Sabitzer for Fred would have changed absolutely nothing. Casemiro Bruno Shaw and Martinez all dropped 0/10 performances, once that happens you‚Äôre pretty much fucked no matter who else is on the pitch",Manchester United,Yes,jb3pc7h,t1_jb3nz9t
"For Weghorst 2 of our best players have to play out of position, Bruno on wings and rashford upfront. It's like nerfing both of your star players to accommodate a championship level player, he is hard worker I get it but there should be no scenario where bruno and rashford take the backseat. Rashford vs taa was something to look forward to, instead we got bruno against him, who has no pace as a winger his attributes suit him as 10 not a winger. Personally i hope we are done with bruno on wing experiment",Manchester United,Yes,jb3pgmh,t1_jb3nz9t
Amateur hour. The shaw clearance summed it up was like the days of ragnick and ole him and Maguire running into each other.,Manchester United,Yes,jb43tih,t1_jb43aut
"Yeah this summary is accurate, it‚Äôs quite impressive how well distributed the fuck-ups are. Got most of the starting 11 in there each responsible for a goal or two.

I don‚Äôt know if Shaw was just carrying a knock still in this game? But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen him make a worse performance in his career for us. Usually he‚Äôs just excellent so I couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes as he made mistake after mistake.",Manchester United,Yes,jb43xub,t1_jb43aut

"Hold them accountable. Ask them to recognise their mistakes and ensure they don't happen again.

I don't really care about fining them wages, because that means nowt when they earn ¬£100k a week. I'd rather they just fix their shit in training and come back to beat Betis in midweek.

I would drop some of them for the next game, because they're clearly fatigued as well as having played like shit. Malacia for Shaw, AWB for Dalot, Sancho for Antony, Sabitzer for Bruno and McTominay for Fred. Probably Lindelof for Varane as well.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4i8c4,t1_jb4h52l

"Drop them for a week. They miss the EL game and Southampton at home. We can hopefully get something off Southampton with our second string, and it probably wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if we got knocked out of the EL and didn't have to play as many games.

Sports can draw out a lot of emotions, and it can  feel like the world is ending. But try to make sure it is not your own life that ia ending. No result or sportingevent is worth dying for. It's only an aspect in life, where you can choose how much you want to put of yourself towarda it. 

Good luck, and don't do irrational decisions when emotions are running in high-gear",Manchester United,Yes,jb374qy,t1_jb33i6m

How does that make sense if he lacks discipline it's gonna cost the team Erik wouldn't even start him anyways,Manchester United,Yes,jb4swj7,t1_jb4sl7o
"I think he sticks him out wide because of his lack od ball retention, losing the ball as a wide player is far less frustrating and dangerous to us than it is if bruno loses it in the middle. Thats my take",Manchester United,Yes,jb4vryn,t1_jb4sl7o
"Well this passes the eye test, when we lose we tend to collapse",Manchester United,Yes,jb4z31v,t1_jb4yvmo
"FYI, players usually don't post by themselves on social media, with a few exceptions",Manchester United,Yes,jb5qiwo,t1_jb5pjju
"""you're losing 5-0 mate"" when Bruno went after trent. Could hear Spitty laughing in the background as the goals went in too, sounded like a Catherine Tate character.",Manchester United,Yes,jb66u7b,t1_jb635io
I'd rather we win 4 and lose 1 by 1 üòÇ,Manchester United,Yes,jb709b7,t1_jb6xz8x
"I guess everyone is 'overreacting' because of the nature of the loss and not the loss itself. Losing by 2-3 goals is ok but by 7 goals, against Liverpool, in our current form? That's why. I have made peace with it. EtH will sort this out. I believe in him",Manchester United,Yes,jb3r9q2,t1_jb3qis1
"Our biggest loss in like a 100 years, to fucking liverpool of all people. We're not overreacting. Its gut wrenching, fucking heartbreaking. Its a little early for some of us to be positive about any of it.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3rwk7,t1_jb3qis1
"People like you need to understand that swiping such a pathetic performance is not the way to go if we want to win titles. Especially when we concede big three fking times in a single season.

Swiping your problems under the rug and shrugging them of, only looking at the highs of the season is incredibly idiotic and dangerous. Not what winners do.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3qy9q,t1_jb3qis1
"that was not a lose
that was embarrassment",Manchester United,Yes,jb3r6ea,t1_jb3qis1
"That‚Äôs what I hate the most, it‚Äôs literally our best season in the last 10 years and people are reacting as if we‚Äôre going to get relegated after this loss. I understand why people are angry but come one we had 11 unbeaten games before this. Losing 7-0 to Liverpool is unacceptable but we‚Äôre still 7 points above them. And if this loss means that the team will be better next season im all for it. Let‚Äôs remember where we were last year and then look at the results.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3r9gb,t1_jb3qis1
"every player dropped a stinker yesterday, and coming to de gea if it werent for him and his early saves in games of leicester,west ham we would be down by 2 or more goals and comeback would have been even more difficult. Yesterdays match shouldnt be used to evaluate someone as not even 1 player performed to their potential each and everyone shared the blame for that loss.",Manchester United,Yes,jb46rys,t1_jb46gri
"Bit flippant, this. We should focus on obtaining another keeper this summer, but DDG shouldn't leave. He could definitely be a back-up choice.",Manchester United,Yes,jb46kdy,t1_jb46gri

"same players won us our 1st trophy in 6 years just a week back xD u are expecting players to go on monster run under ten hag in his 1st season? the progress we have achieved so far is nothing short of miracle considering the disaster last season was. We are still a work under progress, yes the loss sucked it was humiliating but its not the end of the world. Ten hag and players will get back to their usual run of form yesterday was exception",Manchester United,Yes,jb49yyl,t1_jb49kvk
"Equalling our worst ever defeat. This won't be easily forgotten and considering it follows on from last seasons 5-0 and 4-0 losses to Liverpool, questions needs to be answered.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3h1x1,t1_jb3fwfd
I think yesterday was the Villa 3-1 game with everything going wrong and Nunez and Gakpo being world class movement and finishing wise. Salah wrecked us but that was down to Shaw having a really really poor game. Attitude from Bruno and Antony was shocking and Fred didn't provide any cover.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3pi3i,t1_jb3pa09
"We deserved all the blame now, it was not just a defeat, it was a historical humiliation, no excuse ab that.

A true Manucian should feel upset, even if we bounce back next match, it's hard for people to forget a 0-7 lost to our biggest rival. That's fact",Manchester United,Yes,jb3vy6f,t1_jb3ul44
"biggest club in the world, they were waiting for us and it didn‚Äôt help that there‚Äôs a loud group of fans bragging about our recent successes and overhyping this team (obviously a lot of it was tongue in cheek but still). sadly, there‚Äôs nothing we can do that will make a statement besides win everything lol",Manchester United,Yes,jb3ush4,t1_jb3ul44

"Commentator yesterday said under SAF we conceded 4+ goals in a premier league match like only 4 or 5 times. Since he has retired it happens almost every season, actually like two to three times every season. Fuckinh Everton put 4 past us, Spurs put 6 past us. It's a joke",Manchester United,Yes,jb4bpev,t1_jb4amll
"Since when is top 4 going to be an issue?  Liverpool is certainly making its way back up top.  But other than that Idt there is legitimate concern unless we suffer through injuries.  Newcastle has dipped a bit recently and don‚Äôt look as good   They haven‚Äôt won a game in their last 5 PL matches.    Even though they have 2 matches in hand their recent form doesn‚Äôt make me believe they can take advantage of it.  Spurs are gonna Spurs. And even then we have a game in hand  Granted Liverpool May surpass us for third ( which is still not definite) but Idt top 4 is an issue unless there are injuries. 

Maybe we should bow out of Europa and just rest everyone but I‚Äôd like to see what we can do in the FA cup.   But these cups are good to set the foundation for a winning culture even if they aren‚Äôt major trophies",Manchester United,Yes,jb6httq,t1_jb6d6jl
Would you rather get stabbed in the arse by a kitchen knife or stabbed in the other arse cheek by a butcher knife,Manchester United,Yes,jb6xv63,t1_jb6ww4f

"Almost everyone gonna be pissed with them mocking rashford celebration, but it's not lack of class at all, we are rivals,  they shouldve take a piss out of us after trashing us, and vice versa. only thing we can do is be better and get our revenge next time",Manchester United,Yes,jb3f4qf,t1_jb3ehw2
"Tbh the only thing lacking class in that game was how some of our players behaved going down a few goals. 

Instead of using their heads they resorted to dumb fouls and Bruno had the trifecta of idiotic tackles, blatant diving and senselessly arguing for the ref.

Liverpool played well, sorted at will and celebrated. I have many problems with that 90 mins, all of them directed at United players and staff.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3itsk,t1_jb3ehw2
"Dont be.
Getting knocked around by your biggest rivals 7-0 and people thinking yeah its all good part of the process need their head wobbled.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6up8y,t1_jb6o4q9
"Don't be daft. This was an appalling result but if we end the season in the top three and with trophies, it's a successful season. Especially after the way things started.

Of course this game will factor into Ten Hag's squad building plans. Every game we play factors in, to some degree. How the players respond to this is even more important, and I hope they're not going through the same kind of histrionics as some fans. They've got to get back on the ball and win a game on Thursday.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6oqow,t1_jb6o4q9
">Weghost is shit, Anthony and Sancho are overrated and overpriced

Well that's just the painful truth, how long will it take people here to admit it? Weghorst is not a shit player overall, he's not, but an awful striker/CF. He only plays as a 10 because he's shit in his actual position.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4qnte,t1_jb4gar6
Saw one lad saying he's not watching United for the rest of the season. Might even be in this thread. Absolute whopper. No getting away from the horror show that was yesterday afternoon but this is the best season we've had in years. Why would you bin the rest of the season after one terrible result? We won a cup the previous Sunday FFS. I wonder how some people deal with real life problems.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4h51x,t1_jb4gar6
"Somethings are reactionary, while some aren't. People have been critical of these players even when we were winning but no one wanted to see that so they were down voted and the comments hidden.

It was the same when people tried to be critical of Ole during our good spells. The problems we saw yesterday didn't come out of thin air. 

We will most likely bounce back but there are still issues that need to be rectified.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4h59e,t1_jb4gar6
clicked on it and it made me realise how high quality our sub is.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3jzqk,t1_jb3fzkx
"Come on now, thrashing a rival is just too fun you forget the context of the season. Did we win the league the season we beat Arsenal 8-2? No, City did, but I‚Äôll never forget that game.

As if we wouldn‚Äôt be having a party denting Liverpool‚Äôs hopes of a trophy and bringing them crashing down to earth.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3ig03,t1_jb3fzkx
Would be a massive overreaction to remove it based on one game.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3ya2j,t1_jb3xes1
"Definitely NO. We need a true captain with a cold head to boost our team's morale when we are losing, a true warrior.
Sadly Bruno is not that one",Manchester United,Yes,jb3xlrq,t1_jb3xes1
"Yes. One performance doesn't mean we strip him off the captaincy, heck we let Maguire have the captain armband for doing nothing when he comes on what makes u think Bruno will lose his captaincy based off one disastrous result where every person on pitch was responsible. If we count out this season, Bruno has been the most impact signing for our club so far.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3y0v2,t1_jb3xes1
Yeah. It will damage his confidence even more.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3xqtv,t1_jb3xes1
"If we're truly looking to move on from Bruno as captain, it has to be Varane I guess?",Manchester United,Yes,jb3xshw,t1_jb3xes1
It isn't an experiment it's a necessity. Ten Hag doesn't have options.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4783h,t1_jb46e7o
How does it matter anyway? He'll be back on the injury table after playing for 45 mins.,Manchester United,Yes,jb472k2,t1_jb46e7o
"Okay come on everyone rates EtH but obviously they'd shit on us for dropping 7 to our biggest rivals. No need to make up twisted theories to feel good about it. We were shit and we lost. All the players and the manager fucked up. Literally no positives. 

The rest I agree. Target was top 4 and a trophy for this season. On course for that. Need to finish strong now.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5j0la,t1_jb5grey
"We just completely lost our heads once they scored the second. They didn't even play amazingly, we just completely shit the bed. Also, I've never seen so many 50/50 balls end up bouncing straight to one team. ETH messed up the line up, subs didn't help, it was the worst second half performance I've ever seen. They had 8 shots on target, XG of 2.5 or something stupid. A few players could have been sent off. Bruno put his hands on an official (barely, but still did) so wouldn't be hugely surprised to see a ban.

All round, horrific day.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2zxtw,t1_jb2xjkj
Pep was getting called a fraud in his first season. He'd absolutely have got a lot of stick if he got beat 7-0. Maybe not on our level but that comes with being the biggest club in the country,Manchester United,Yes,jb5h1qi,t1_jb5ghuz
They have shown us with a trophy and 3rd position lol,Manchester United,Yes,jb50l48,t1_jb4zf4w

"please someone enlighten me the bs about him as a ball-possession player, this guy won't do us any good anytime soon.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3ku98,t1_jb3hnmh
"Totally agree.
People still remember when we battered Arsenal 8-2 over a decade ago and in fact there's *even* a Wikipedia page dedicated to it:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C._8%E2%80%932_Arsenal_F.C.

What I really don't understand, and I wish someone could explain it to me, is why we have been battered so much in recent years?
We are now talking about multiple drubbings against Liverpool, and really unflattering results against Brighton, Brentford, Tottenham and I think Leicester too in the last couple of years.

I don't understand how Liverpool, even when they were an average team in the '90s and '00s never got thumped by us but this team allows it to happen multiple times!?",Manchester United,Yes,jb4mjnj,t1_jb4fg9b
He had less than a 50% pass accuracy that game too. Honestly shocking.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6vwtq,t1_jb6uecj
The mentality went down after we conceded a goal early in 2nd half.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6cgjw,t1_jb6bna0
Tale as old as time of the team doing their usual mental collapse as soon as 2/3-0 happened.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6fuu2,t1_jb6bna0
Mental collapse after 2-0 leading to terrible individual mistakes. Liverpool were also ruthless with their finishing and were winning every single second ball it felt like. Everything was bouncing their way.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6g2ue,t1_jb6bna0
Lost confidence + insane bad luck,Manchester United,Yes,jb6okfm,t1_jb6bna0
"Its pretty easy to be a good captain when everythings going well, as soon as the team really needed a leader on the pitch he preferred to act like a child. I like bruno, and i like his mentality but right now i believe the club needs someone far more level headed and commanding than what bruno provides",Manchester United,Yes,jb5wjz9,t1_jb5vdp6
"Thing is, when everything is looking good, its easy to look great. The true leaders, are the ones that step up when shit hits the fan. When we need him to step up when times are hard he is he first to fold. What example does that set.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5yydn,t1_jb5vdp6
"Hasn't so much ""fallen out"" as he was never in. He really should've had another loan. He still had trouble making an impact for the worst team in La Liga last season. We can't suddenly expect him to be a difference maker for a Champions League quality side, the difference in level is just too high",Manchester United,Yes,jb36f0l,t1_jb2w5w4
And why we continued to play so open after we were already 3/4 goals down at anfield.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3nnq2,t1_jb3nfk2
"I love eth and I think he's the best thing to happen to the club in a long, long time but to think he's blameless in this is naive. That being said, from what we've seen from him before i know he will learn from this and come back stronger.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3qgzg,t1_jb3nfk2
"Dude, Erik just won us a trophy last weekend. We had a bad bad day at the office. We will recover. We have to support him.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3o46f,t1_jb3nfk2
">My question to Ten Hag would be why Sabitzer didn't start instead of Fred

Ten Hag seems reluctant to drop players to the bench if they're playing well. Fred has been playing well so he's let him keep going. 

I don't think it can be disputed that Sabitzer is the better midfield player though, so hopefully this is the right time for him to start alongside Casemiro, and that will be the first choice pairing for the rest of the season.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4jqlm,t1_jb4jab5
"Fred starting is perfectly resonable, he stardted in both Barca and Newcastle games and was coming from best month under that shirt. 

My only concern with starting XI is why Dalot over AWB after that Newcastle game.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4ji0d,t1_jb4jab5
"I'm concerned about Antony.  I'm not as concerned about Bruno.  Roy Keane and Eric Cantina captained this club and behaved far more unprofessionally at times, but we forgave them.

Of course Bruno's attitude was questionable in the 2nd half, I'm still seething at the players, but in all honesty, in 20 years time I will still remember the defeat, but I don't think I will remember Bruno's part in the defeat.",Manchester United,Yes,jb57d7g,t1_jb54tas
Yesterdays game is a bad example. Was isolated up top by himself and no midfield to progress the ball to him.,Manchester United,Yes,jb38wqk,t1_jb3742e
Bruh did you watch him last season lmao. This season is a monumental improvement,Manchester United,Yes,jb3pwib,t1_jb3742e
You think we can get a result against Betis by resting the first team? They are much better than Southampton,Manchester United,Yes,jb3qn7y,t1_jb3pjle
"Kagawa didnt fit in. 

Mihkitaryan didnt fit in. 

Sancho 80m and 350k pw for a guy with physicality of an academy player who seem to not fix his unability to play 90 minutes even after being sent for invidual traning on continent. 

Yeah,  that Dortmund transfers are rough.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4emoj,t1_jb4ebmu
How is Sancho getting blamed today lol?,Manchester United,Yes,jb4ejhb,t1_jb4ebmu

"Gakpo plays on the left, Antony on the right.

That said, a competent DOF would have spent 80m much more wisely than on Antony.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3tnp3,t1_jb3scov
"You got downvoted for being positive? Here‚Äôs an upvote for not being depressing.

I know 7-0 is a horrendous result but if you‚Äôd have told me at the start of the season that we‚Äôd: 

- Beat Barca in the Europa League and be favourites to win it
- be comfortable in 3rd place 
- win a cup 
- be in contention for every cup available to us after the halfway mark
- Have a win and a loss vs Liverpool and City, even if the Etihad and Anfield games were embarrassing

I‚Äôd have snapped your hand off. 

The team and ETH are still miles ahead of where we were last season, but we shouldn‚Äôt expect them to be world beaters after not even a year of ETH. That‚Äôs ETHs first visit to Anfield, a lesson for him. The team are bouncing back better from bad results. Better to be behind them and remember we‚Äôre at the start of the process, not the end of it. When ETH first joined we were all saying we‚Äôd be happy with a trophy within 3 years and compete for top 4 this season. We‚Äôre ahead of schedule.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4dyb1,t1_jb4auyt
"The result taken in isolation, regardless of how the season ends, is unforgivable.

Losing 7-0 with 11 men on the pitch, with most of them mentally checked out after 3 goals, is indeed unforgivable.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3m3n7,t1_jb3lce1
"I think if you offered us at the start of the season would we take being battered 7-0 by Pool if we could finish 3rd in the League we‚Äôd have snapped your hand off for it. Gotta put it in perspective

Just worth ignoring the ridiculous theatrical media circus too. They did it when Arteta lost 3 on the bounce at the start of last season and they‚Äôre doing it again now. United Is massive and the more incendiary the headline the more eyeballs and the more revenue generated. It‚Äôs so transparent at this point.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3lw34,t1_jb3lce1
"Mate, he definitely got his tactics wrong, or at least not great. But not to the extent that it warrants a 7-0 defeat. 1-0 at half-time is a reflection of wrong tactics and defensive errors. He should have made a change just like he did in prior matches. But none of which should result in a 7-0 defeat.",Manchester United,Yes,jb45ohj,t1_jb44yrb
"I agree. Maybe it's because, in some ways it's harder to see exactly what he did wrong when the players played so badly",Manchester United,Yes,jb453al,t1_jb44yrb
"what are u talking about whole sub is criticizing him for getting his tactics wrong, wout as number 10 , bruno on wing rashford upfront just doesnt work.",Manchester United,Yes,jb452zh,t1_jb44yrb
Yeah Klopp got one over on him tactically but the 7-0 is because the players went to pieces. That's on them and not ETH.,Manchester United,Yes,jb45bfi,t1_jb44yrb
"Well he isn‚Äôt on the pitch playing is he? 
Those players had a collective brain fart fuck all he could do",Manchester United,Yes,jb454br,t1_jb44yrb
This result is 2000 % on the boss bad tactics and bad result,Manchester United,Yes,jb4572t,t1_jb44yrb
There's far more dead weight before Bruno to be sold.,Manchester United,Yes,jb486p4,t1_jb47h4p
"jesus christ whats wrong with people on this sub ? whats with bruno hate all of a sudden ? He is probably the only player who has performed most consistently in past years. You do realize that he is being played out of position to accomodate ten hag tactics right ? he has played 10, lw , rw. So a player adjusting for others so that they can flourish is at fault but not those who are supposed to perform because bruno adjusted for them ? damn talk about delusion",Manchester United,Yes,jb4808q,t1_jb47h4p
He is a good player but not a captain material. He is ok for now but we need someone who doesnt put his head down and whine when we are losing.,Manchester United,Yes,jb47wls,t1_jb47h4p
"He was played out of position and very frustrated. Doesn‚Äôt mean it warrants the behavior though. 

Still, bit far fetched to want him out no?",Manchester United,Yes,jb48qpf,t1_jb47h4p
"bruno cult ? i have been supporting this club for over 20 years lmao. U are delusional with ur one sided takes if someone has different opinion than urs doesnt mean they are in bruno cult, it just means they understand what player has given to the team so far and not judge them based off one bad disaster of result.",Manchester United,Yes,jb49o8z,t1_jb47h4p

"I think going on current form a lot of us were expecting AWB to start. And no one expected Bruno on the left with Wout at 10. The players gave up completely, but the tactics honestly were confusing for most of us",Manchester United,Yes,jb4lfu3,t1_jb4l79u
"Most of us expected AWB to start ahead of Dalot, don't try to pretend it was a hindsight thing. Dalot has been so bad since his injury, regularly getting hooked at half time.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4lu6y,t1_jb4l79u
The 2nd goal really killed the team mentally. And it was a very avoidable goal.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4br9w,t1_jb4ahdn

"Several times yesterday he had the opportunity to take on a defender and run into space. And each time he either slowed down play or made a lazy pass. 

If that‚Äôs Salah he takes advantage of those moments. Obviously Salah is world class, but that‚Äôs what you want from your winger if you‚Äôre a top 4 side. 100mil for Antony was simply ridiculous.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5lwi8,t1_jb5kygy
"I don't see this anywhere. Everyone is raving about Liverpools finishing and saying United were very poor defensively, either of which won't happen in every game.",Manchester United,Yes,jb60ne5,t1_jb5yqf6
"I think it's clear to most people that Weghorst should score more. The dude tries wherever he's put on the pitch and hasn't missed a game since he joined. While we've had Martial, Antony and Sancho out for a while (and Eriksen/VDB) he's been very useful for giving us 11 players, an outlet in midfield, height at defensive set pieces and pressing opposition defenses.

I'm grateful for his efforts and so I won't knock him for what looks like a lack of ability/luck. It's not his fault Martial can't stay fit and start playing games",Manchester United,Yes,jb4c3vh,t1_jb49o1j
"Nah, disagree with this. They can be extremely tired and fatigued because of the game frequency, but that is not an excuse at all to ship 6 goals in a single half of football against our biggest rivals. This was a complete mental collapse, the likes of which we‚Äôve seen 4-5 times the past 2 seasons. No other big 6 team collapses like this. We need to eliminate this mentality.

Still positive overall, we just know we have further to go than we thought last week.",Manchester United,Yes,jb404hh,t1_jb3zryy

Bruno is the most hated player in the league they‚Äôll get at him any chance they get,Manchester United,Yes,jb39cky,t1_jb35cff

[removed],Manchester United,Yes,jb4ef3o,t1_jb4dy81
It was a problem. Only because we conceded 6 in the second half the first half looks better but during the game we looked weirdly unco-ordinated and Liverpool had like 70% possession. People were expecting the second half to be better and the rest is history,Manchester United,Yes,jb4e5hf,t1_jb4dy81
"Yes, we will, we will finish 3rd comfortably",Manchester United,Yes,jb4haxi,t1_jb4h3ek
"Yes. Yesterday's result is unacceptible but it's just one game, good for them and bad for us. They were shit for the most part of the season",Manchester United,Yes,jb4i0lj,t1_jb4h3ek
Yes.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4hthf,t1_jb4h3ek
"Liverpool won‚Äôt even get top 4. Yesterday was an absolute freak result. They‚Äôll drop points against any team that sits in against them, just as they did against Palace last week.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4k1a8,t1_jb4h3ek

"Nice narrative that you constructed, he was literally the best player on the pitch against the League leaders of Spain",Manchester United,Yes,jb5qq3y,t1_jb5nory
I actually saw someone post yesterday that he was good in that game lmao. He was absolutely awful but because we won it got glossed over. He's been pretty poor recently in most games,Manchester United,Yes,jb5nzok,t1_jb5nory
ETH OUT! This form of 16W 3D 2L in all competitions post world cup is untenable!,Manchester United,Yes,jb58a2i,t1_jb56w47
"If it's a question of please substitute me because I'm going to get sent off and I've lost my head then that begs the question, why did you lose your head? You are an older established international and a captain of the team and you're setting the example and expectations on the pitch. He really should apologize.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2y78c,t1_jb2xoic
"Thats coach decision to play injuried player. 

Also it wasnt cofirmed by any reliable source",Manchester United,Yes,jb613mo,t1_jb606vp
"What are these standards you expect? I‚Äôm not defending the 7-0 loss in any way, I think it was humiliating and the players should be ashamed of themselves. But I also think in the long term we will be fine and fans need to stop being reactionary. I think this is our second loss since the World Cup of memory serves me right. It is not the end of the world and I trust Ten Hag and this team to bounce back. 

To answer your other question, Madrid did lose 5-0 to Barca in 2010, to that Pep Guardiola team. Again, I‚Äôm not comparing that Barca team to this Liverpool team or am I saying our 7-0 humiliation is okay. I am just saying there weren‚Äôt riots and resigning in Madrid and they were just fine after that humiliating defeat to a rival and so will we.

Edit - a few words",Manchester United,Yes,jb3x6ab,t1_jb3wb22
You act like there‚Äôs nothing to play for anymore. Let‚Äôs just all boo next home match huh?,Manchester United,Yes,jb3y1vi,t1_jb3wb22

"De Gea actually wrote and recorded a heavy metal song with his band for her about reflex leg saves.

She shared it on Twitter a few weeks back if you want to scroll through and give it a listen. 

It's pretty intense but the lyrics are beautiful if you understand German. I think it made the top 10 in Bosnia last week.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4zimd,t1_jb4y4sq
I'd take option A any day. We only drop 1 more point in that scenario compared to option B and have the second leg against Betis to win the tie. Sorry but I absolutely wouldn't take a 7-0 from LFC given a choice.,Manchester United,Yes,jb5dhhu,t1_jb5asmo
"I would take option A, the 3 draws, no question about that, even if it does mean 1 less point in the league, as it also means 2 less points for Liverpool, a blow to their CL hopes, and of course the big one, it avoids the most humiliating result in this club's 145 year history.

Fuck me, if I could, I would hand all the players medals back from last Sunday, I'd throw the trophy in the skip, and erase the record books if I thought it could wipe out yesterday's result.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5e7oa,t1_jb5asmo
You really think we stand a chance against Arsenal after all this?,Manchester United,Yes,jb3ubvf,t1_jb3nxsg
"You conveniently forgot the names of some of the worst offenders today - Casemiro, Varane and Martinez. They were diabolical. Are they perennial losers? Or what about ETH who had an absolute mare as well?

The entire team was shit today. Not just Bruno. Not just Shaw. Not just whichever individual you don‚Äôt like.

All of them. This team (as we‚Äôve seen often this season) is capable of far more.

They are all at fault and all need to hold themselves accountable. Not scapegoating select players that‚Äôs part of the problem.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2z20r,t1_jb2wwsp

To be fair after a 7-0 drubbing some negative commentary is expected. Team needs to reset and make sure it doesn't impact rest of season. It was a shambles but a bigger shambles will be if it derails chase for more silverware and/or leads to spell of form where.pur top 4 finish comes under jeopardy,Manchester United,Yes,jb57kl1,t1_jb56vz0

to be fair to ten hag he did play few backups against west ham which clearly proved to be massive drop off in quality. Clearly they cant be trusted hence his key players have to keep playing week in week out,Manchester United,Yes,jb57b9d,t1_jb569pd

">Looking at how Arsenal and Liverpool fans hate us (personally i dont hate these clubs. these are rivals. Ofc i am not from England hence this stance) i sincerely support Man City for the title.

You don't think City fans hate us? Lol",Manchester United,Yes,jb47fm2,t1_jb46kz4
"Dude....if City win the title they will do a hat trick of PL titles something which is unique to us since no one has done it in the PL era, we have done it twice. Just like Arsenal have their unbeaten season, we have the hat tricks to set us up apart. Do you still want City to win it this season? Knowing very well Arsenal winning it this season wouldnt mean a lot. City winning it could mean they could go for a 4peat next season.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4871h,t1_jb46kz4
"I know what you mean but football is an escape for a lot of us with work life being bad/hectic, its the only real hobby/passion that some of us have. Results like this are really deflating and does have an impact on other aspects of our lives.",Manchester United,Yes,jb42d0x,t1_jb423tv
"I think this time is a little bit different. We had hope, we were on a good run, just won a league cup. Fans thought the team had transformed into something different. This game was a huge letdown, but yeah, it's just a football match afterall. I hope the team can bounce back in the coming game, don't know if it will lead to another disappointment tho. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø",Manchester United,Yes,jb42ooi,t1_jb423tv

"Yes it is an anomaly, we haven't been getting beat in games never mind 7-0. 

Show some resilience",Manchester United,Yes,jb4bl2m,t1_jb4b9u7
"Considering it‚Äôs our 3rd loss in 30 games yeah, it‚Äôs not a regular occurrence by any means. Also 7 goals from 2.9 xG is definitely an anomaly. We were abysmal yesterday, but it‚Äôs not indicative of how we‚Äôve been all season especially since the WC.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4dbmn,t1_jb4b9u7
Well then I'd say he picked the worst possible match to throw and he should be fired.,Manchester United,Yes,jb54g3e,t1_jb53juy

"All the posters here who are desperately ready to nosh Qatari cock don‚Äôt seem to understand we can‚Äôt go out and spend 500 million in one window.

Also, goldbridge is a tosser",Manchester United,Yes,jb4vgqn,t1_jb4unk1
You lost me at us not having comfortable wins since we signed Wout. Everything else lost credibility.,Manchester United,Yes,jb62k6w,t1_jb61kcj
"We needed a RWer, neither of those fill that hole.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4fr64,t1_jb4f9nm
Lol‚Ä¶ before last few games for Liverpool it was the opposite way. Wouldn‚Äôt swap for any of them  at the moment nor I think Anthony was worth the  100m.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4fipi,t1_jb4f9nm

This season is nothing like that, we are more in control in the wins we have gained this season. Lol, every season some big clubs will underperform, honestly dont get this statement.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3bzvh,t1_jb37ib5
This is absolutely nothing like Ole‚Äôs 2nd season if that‚Äôs the similarity you‚Äôre going off. It‚Äôs useless drawing parallels as the context and relative situations are so different. A lot more structural positives than the entirety of Ole‚Äôs tenure this season as well imo.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3aalz,t1_jb37ib5
That is indeed dramatic,Manchester United,Yes,jb4zcc8,t1_jb4xwnj
"We re on the up bro, trust in ten hag but yanno what people can downvote me or what not we still got some deadwood we gotta get rid of and some players need upgrading. I think to go to the next level we need better than the likes of shaw, bruno and de gea. We re still 3 or 4 away from being a top team",Manchester United,Yes,jb4yf9u,t1_jb4xwnj
"We did beat both earlier on in season to be fair so 6 points from those fixtures isn't bad. The turnovers on the away fixtures were embarrassing though and yesterday has potential to define season of we don't respond 

Don't lose faith yet

Team is mentally fragile still but taking the season as a whole, it's clear we are better than last year and moving in correct direction. This was a setback (admittedly huge)",Manchester United,Yes,jb4yfz7,t1_jb4xwnj

To beat and embarrass their biggest rival. Maybe we should try it sometime.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2wi11,t1_jb2vkz1
Top 4 is very much doable for Liverpool.,Manchester United,Yes,jb2w7yh,t1_jb2vkz1
"Fred is an absolute mystery to me. He can have a run of 3 good games that'll make people completely forget that he's had a run of 5 awful games. This pattern has followed him for his entire United career yet I'm just sat here the entire time thinking why don't we just replace this wildly inconsistent player?

You don't want wildcards in your team but especially not in central midfield

I wouldn't hold much hope though, a lot of this sub wants us to sign  Wout fucking Weghorst on a permanent deal. Mediocrity is a cultural issue among the fanbase",Manchester United,Yes,jb68r2z,t1_jb67jgi

"RedCafe is a lot more pragmatic, whereas r/reddevils is full of (toxic) positivity

He is been consistent all season, was great in the Barca game, literally scored against City, was great in the cup final, was great against Liverpool at the reverse fixture, against Arsenal, fucked Spurs in the ass massively.

"I think u should, don't take things too seriously its just a game at the end of the day.

I saw the entire first half n then after completing some work i started watching at 64th minute n saw it was 4-0 i was like wtf happened.

Then i saw darwin n salah score.

Then i was about to stop watching at 85th minute but decided to watch the full game instead n saw firmino's goal.

I started watching football last season i saw this club being battered by liverpool 5-0 n 4-0 last season then by brighton 4-0 last season but i decided to support this club because i like this fanbase n i relate to some level with the current squad (capable of great things but need some proper advice/direction). 

This is a wake up call for all ppl who support united we still nowhere close to being back.

This is arteta's 3rd season n only now arsenal r challenging for titles (even arteta said they should aim for top 4 realistically n next season they can be title challengers).

Let's give our bald fraud 2 seasons n after he gets his signings like a midfielders who don't give away the ball like fdj, pedri, bernardo, etc.

"I watched Antony yesterday make an outside of the left food pass to avoid making a basic right footed pass that you learn as a 6 year old.

Watching Antony being so fucking one dimensional makes me hate Greenwood more and more. Prick was one of the most two footed players we've ever had and Ten Hag would have loved him on the right. Imagine having that much talent and still not being able to keep your hands off your missus,Manchester United,Yes,jb3sxll,t1_jb2vz1w
You're not wrong. I fucking love Bruno but he's got pretty big flaws that stop him from being an elite leader of a player. Was hoping he'd grow into the captain's role and curb his god damn awful petulance the moment things don't go our way is infuriating but he was genuinely detrimental to team morale today.,Manchester United,Yes,jb34bgk,t1_jb337jh
"He's a quality player, and I hope he wins a whole bunch of stuff with us. But I've never been sold on him as captain (which is fine if you are, opinions are great).

Or here's to hoping he can grow a pair eventually",Manchester United,Yes,jb34c3k,t1_jb337jh
"This, plus it seems that he was gesturing to be subbed off at the dying moments. Of course, there is some justification that he might be knackered from playing too much, but asking to be subbed off to with this result as captain is some super weak mentality, almost cowardly. If you ask me, the armband should be given to Case.",Manchester United,Yes,jb35wsr,t1_jb337jh
"While I agree Bruno needs to stop whining so much, but to pin our big losses on him‚Ä¶.  Correlation not equals causation.",Manchester United,Yes,jb33vnc,t1_jb337jh

"Bruno is one and De Gea is another. While he may not have made any mistakes, a statue in goal would have been more effective yesterday.

Schmeichel and VDS have had bad games, but their bottom level was still 5/10.

When De Gea has a bad game, it is often a zero or 1/10.",Manchester United,Yes,jb41sqj,t1_jb337jh
He is a flat-track bully like Sancho.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3p28t,t1_jb337jh
"Bruno lost his head completely, and its not the 1st or 5th time its happened.

He was whining and shouting a lot, he even pushed the assistant ref at some point.

Spurs lost 4-1 to 16th Place Leicester recently.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4p60j,t1_jb4nqac
It‚Äôs very easy to defend him at the moment but I also noticed there was no overlap at all from Dalot. It might be because Antony stays so close to the touchline that there is no room for Dalot to overlap,Manchester United,Yes,jb3dvhc,t1_jb3coe1
"Somewhat surprisingly, it was probably just as many arsenal trolls as there were liverpool trolls.",Manchester United,Yes,jb557rj,t1_jb54jgf
True that is what I am saying and I am not here to single him out for that performance but I general even the games we were winning.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3rfrd,t1_jb3r0xc
"The absolute huffing of copium that was going on about Antony being incredible cos of the balance he provides on the RW and his defensive workrate was unrivalled. 

He is one of the most one footed players I have seen in my life. When you are doing outside the foot crosses with your left instead of naturally with your right there is something seriously wrong. His lack of pace is a serious issue too.

I am fairly sure he is just not going to be good enough. We will need to look at Amad or Sancho or buying another RW. Defenders took 20 games to figure him out and it‚Äôs only going to get harder for him from here.

Also for his defensive workrate, where was that yesterday? He was as bad as the rest of them if not worse.",Manchester United,Yes,jb608jq,t1_jb3r0xc

I don‚Äôt want to make it out as he‚Äôs a scapegoat today - almost everyone was embarrassing and awful but the fact is we can‚Äôt rest some of our main midfielders because McTominay is so bloody awful. 3rd choice (4th choice when Eriksen comes back) box to box option, can‚Äôt play as a DM, not creative enough as a 10.

And they spent less. We should have a fucking badass team,Manchester United,Yes,jb39blg,t1_jb34ybu

"His one-footedness is not an issue as much as the fact that his strong foot is not good enough.

Robben and Giggs were hilariously one-footed and it was never an issue because their left peg was world class and they could beat players for fun.

Antony can't complete a cross with his left foot and his tricks are utterly pointless.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3tlgr,t1_jb3tacf
"I get that. we cant all be physical specimens. But he has something else. He's Brazillian. We've seen he has tekkers. Use THAT. We saw how he tortured dan burn, just do that, and use it to get past your man",Manchester United,Yes,jb64eft,t1_jb6346p
"It's vital we get the win, if we get a draw or somehow lose, I'm worried it'll be the start of a run where we drop league points and narrow the gap with Liverpool.

Tbh there was no good possible captaincy decision at the time really.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3fzau,t1_jb36q5i
"that's exactly type of behaviour that leads to burn out. also i'm not talking as in injury, cause i've never seen him injured, although he's been running less and less recently. i mean like when someone looks absolutely drained out. specifically in that west ham match, there were a few close shots were he looked like he's about to pass out any moment.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3ayhx,t1_jb38jn2
"> It's been 12 years and we still take the piss out of Arsenal for that 8-2.

"Ehh, some will take the piss, sure, but that's football fandom. No one uses that Arsenal result to say that the team is shit now, do they? Eventually, it'll just be something you shake your head over and shrug and move on.

"> Dalot and AWB are more than good enough.

No, they really are not. Not for a club like United.

This is Dalot's 5th season and AWB's 4th. Neither have been able to establish themselves yet. Both of them have very obvious weaknesses and have shown no sign of improving them. They are capable of going on 3-4 months of good form, but cannot sustain themselves beyond that.

They are both good enough to be back ups, nothing more.

>Keeper also is not a priority over positions like centre mid. 

It absolutely is. De Gea is not a world class keeper anymore, and the 99-05 years should tell you why we should not compromise in that position.

A world class keeper alone can make the difference between title winners and 4th place challengers.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4ey6e,t1_jb4et0s
"Dalot has had 4 good months in a United shirt, and even then he couldn't make a good cross to save his life. I'd say he deserves to be given another shot based on those 4 months, because he was really good, but I don't think it's necessarily true that he's an excellent player when healthy, because he's been pretty shit for 90% of his time here.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4hqrb,t1_jb4et0s
City had sagna and Zabaleta both better than dalot and AWB replaced with Walker and Danilo in the same window - that's the standard we need to better,Manchester United,Yes,jb4fqfr,t1_jb4et0s

"To be fair - Bruno is the most creative player in the league bar KDB

He has over 10 XA, but we‚Äôve only scored 6 goals from those chances.

The next closest player to him is Trippier with 9, then Pascal Gross, Odegaard & TAA all on 7.5",Manchester United,Yes,jb6y60r,t1_jb6i4ro
I‚Äôve noticed in several games that Weghorst would be sitting unguarded in the box begging for a cross in but would get nada. Maybe the players don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a good enough striker but I‚Äôve seen it happen when Rash plays CF too so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs entirely because of their rating of Weghorst. I‚Äôm surprised that more people don‚Äôt pick up on our lack of service to our strikers.,Manchester United,Yes,jb6tgy9,t1_jb6i4ro
We literally don't play the ball into the box half the time because our players don't rate Weghorst. You put a player like Kane or Osimhen and they're gonna get the ball a lot more,Manchester United,Yes,jb6o2ud,t1_jb6i4ro
They are also our best performing players,Manchester United,Yes,jb5jnpa,t1_jb5hjtd
"For me, it showed how little he knows them. Which is normal really, you can't see them in every scenario. He has seen them overcome a goal deficit to win several times. However, he hadn't seen them be quickly three goals down to a rival at a venue like Anfield. We did, we saw it last season. Now Erik has fully met our squad... which has apparently no gear other than ""SHIT THE BED"" after conceding 2-3.

But ye a lot seemed off. The weird corners... wtf was that? Why were we seemingly experimenting with set piece plays at Anfield? do they not know Weghorst has to duck air traffick, or that casemiro throws himself at everything he sees in the air? So why play short balls and do fuck all with them? It was so frustrating.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2x2nk,t1_jb2vkub
"‚ÄòWorked‚Äô is a bit of a stretch considering we won the game after bruno was put back in the middle. Also we played much better in the second half after his substitution.

"PSxG has an average keeper conceding 4 yesterday, not 7. Liverpool had an xG of about 3 good finishing made it 4 and De Gea is responsible for turning that into 7. Poor finishing on our part cost us 1 basically. If we played that exact game again with an average goalkeeper we probably lose 3 or 4 - 1. Instead it's a historic loss not equalled since the 30s.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6epbe,t1_jb6705r
"I think you‚Äôre underestimating how crucial the keeper is to the way Ten Hag wants to play. ETH wants to use the keeper as an extra man to receive and give the ball, create attacks and overloads etc. the keeper being elite with their feet is absolutely fundamental to his system. The reason we don‚Äôt play how ETH wants is because De Gea can‚Äôt play out from the back / sweep to save his life. 

ETH is being pragmatic this season because he‚Äôs stuck with what we have but he will change things soon, just like Klopp and Pep did with their keepers when they arrived.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6jzf2,t1_jb6iy9r

"This drained excuse has got to stop. As soon as we play badly people always bring it up. But no if we won today there would be no mention of it.

"Ah yeah, torturing them is a much better idea",Manchester United,Yes,jb2rn3f,t1_jb2re0n
"Pelliestri cant beat a man, he showed this on his loan spell and is very limited footballer just like Anotny and cant even get on bench over Antony.

"Incorrect. The way we come back from this is to win titles.

Nothing else matters.",Manchester United,Yes,jb48c6l,t1_jb43dyy
"Aye, it wasn‚Äôt well judged. But you‚Äôll equally see the same thing happen in almost every game and it‚Äôll pass by unremarked, because it is unremarkable.

Shouldn‚Äôt have done it. Looks like a knob, but it‚Äôs not worthy of its own article. For it to be the top story today is a weird insight into how much attention we get from outside sources.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5lhkl,t1_jb5l4hp
Thankfully I think the referee actually accounted for the fact we were being humiliated and that our captain was taking it worse than anyone else .,Manchester United,Yes,jb5lq4c,t1_jb5l4hp
Was just as unprofessional from the linesman for allowing the Liverpool player to waste time in front of him and blocking Fernandes from trying to get the ball back.,Manchester United,Yes,jb68n40,t1_jb5l4hp
I think EtH should‚Äôve rotated more in some games (like how he refused to rest our first team in the FA Cup vs Reading or how he refused to rest most of the first team for our 2nd leg vs Forest despite a 3-0 lead) but Casemiro had to play yesterday. I guess it depends on the extent of his injury tbf. But I am hesitant to criticise him for not dropping our best player of the season for the biggest game of the season,Manchester United,Yes,jb5vie9,t1_jb5uz0c
"Soften the blow yes, but this pain only goes away when we get to batter them the same way someday. Just hope it comes sooner than we expect.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4d18m,t1_jb4cft9
It will take time for us to forget this pain. Some people even feel like the season is already ended to them,Manchester United,Yes,jb3wi2u,t1_jb3w1ab
outperforming the xG by 4 goals is the definition of a freak result. Teams usually barely outperform their xG by double digits  throughout the whole season. Liverpool almost got half that just yesterday.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4ej6s,t1_jb4djxk
"Trust, can‚Äôt remember Antony actually dribbling past someone, the guy will just cut back and waste every single attack

Don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs even got an assist yet, his overall game is so deficient & having 1 foot makes him so so readable

Worst part is how he‚Äôs picked up 3-4 injuries already, availability is a cause of concern already",Manchester United,Yes,jb30xqn,t1_jb30bs7
I genuinely don't believe Antony is a 40m player. He's the type of player I'd expect Leeds to buy for 20m,Manchester United,Yes,jb4em6c,t1_jb4efpq
"I don't agree at all. He's 22, it's not like he's some youth player. All those problems OP mentioned have been there since the start of the season and it doesn't look like he's improving. Waiting too long to pass to Rashford yesterday is something he does all the time.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4i2n7,t1_jb4etrr
">Is he good enough to be our backup striker?

Nowhere near. And I'm not saying I don't like him. But a backup striker has to have some goals in him, it's a pretty basic requirement.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4314l,t1_jb4241i
"Man we need a DM in the summer so damn badly, it is literally essential. A young backup that can play in place of Case otherwise we‚Äôre gonna run him into the ground and he isn‚Äôt that young. 

McTominay not even in the same stratosphere quality-wise compared to what we need for our DM..literally the most important position on the pitch",Manchester United,Yes,jb3d9ep,t1_jb3cidb
"Problem with Weghorst as striker is he has 0 pace, their backline will play highline as we have seen so many times. When rashford plays there atleast there is threat of counterattack with long balls or special bruno pass. Wout Weghorst can't lead a counter attack even if his life depended on it.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3eoj8,t1_jb3cidb
I think Bruno is the main one he needs to rotate more. He's the most important player in the team but the guy needs a rest every now and then. Felt like Sabitzer should've started at the 10 against West Ham,Manchester United,Yes,jb6dk9l,t1_jb6am81
"If you mean Antony, I was thinking of the way people have a rigid idea of what a winger needs to be without seeing how well he fits Ten Hag's system. 

Setting aside yesterday when virtually everyone played poorly, he's been a very good presser and worked hard defensively. This gets overlooked as people still have a mindset that defence is the job of the back 5 plus a midfielder or two, even though it's becoming clearer every year that you need to defend with all 11 players to win trophies. He also keeps possession nearly every time, allowing us to escape pressure and sustain attacks. His long shooting has been a threat and he's scored some important goals. All of these abilities will become more and more valuable as the team's play improves.

He definitely needs to improve some aspects of his game, especially crossing and training up his right foot. What he definitely won't do is skin players like Saint-Maximin or Adama Traore or become one of our leading scorers, but people will keep slagging him off because they think every winger has to do those things.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5w6dh,t1_jb5qavd
"I'm just being consistent with Ten Hag's philosophy here. How a player responds in times like this, when the rest of the team has their heads down tells more about their mentality than all the times he has done well when the team as a whole have been hungry and passionate.

What message does it send when a captain puts up this performance (talking purely about attitude not about the quality of play) and doesn't face the consequences for it? What will it do to the mentality of the players the next time we find ourselves in a tough situation?

I'm not saying he isn't a great player, he's just not captain material, for now at least.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3po81,t1_jb3p6ok
To Glazers it‚Äôs 6 billion percent,Manchester United,Yes,jb4lr4k,t1_jb4lhci
"Okay, he's a good player. I'll give him that. How has he improved?",Manchester United,Yes,jb4uwdc,t1_jb4urqj
"I also think the same. It's a tactical decision. I remember a lot of games where our wide forwards didn't track back and normally stayed put in their forward positions.

The fourth goal was embarrassing nonetheless.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4xjna,t1_jb4wyr4
"Kulusevski is one year older and has been in the premier league since January last year.

And like clockwork here's the Bruno exceptionalism. He was shit for basically the entire last season too. He's simply a wildly erratic player and will always be. It comes with the play style that he's obsessed with (not having much to his game other than spamming Hollywood balls),Manchester United,Yes,jb54tt9,t1_jb53c0l

"He's dynamic but incredibly wasteful. Yes, he was a bright spark in a dark time, and he had a transformative effect on the team when he first arrived, but he's just not consistent enough to be a centrepiece for this team.

When he plays badly, he's absolutely terrible.",Manchester United,Yes,jb53384,t1_jb51pxu
"Tbf saying he's unbelievably overrated even at his best is not measured criticism, it smacks of someone who dislikes or has an agenda against a player. A measured criticism would be that while he's brilliant creatively, does put in a tremendous shift, and is rarely injured, he has a tendency to lose the plot in important matches which often costs us in those ""top six"" matches. He's been a little better for it this season but obviously reverted to his form and demeanor of last season on Sunday.",Manchester United,Yes,jb57kwl,t1_jb53ztg

"Bruno in the middle Garnacho on left and Rashy at 9.


Wasting Bruno on wings leaves our midfield of creativity as only Case is competent. 

Case left with Fred is only going to get fked as Weghorst runs like a fking stick. No poise, no grace. Whats worst is he fking useless in air despite his height.

Fred is highly inconsistent, short and was losing lots of 50-50s. Sabitzer has better passing IMO. Better in the air too perhaps.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3pp7c,t1_jb3pc7h
"Preach!

2 of our best players and one of our most potent player on the wings. Garnacho.

Weghorst needs to be used as a sub from now on or against power opposition. 

He creates a hell lot of problems for the value he provides.

Biggest issue I have is ETH over relying on him in matches where its clear he will have no impact. If this guy doesn‚Äôt do anything meaningful fin first 30, he will do jack shit the whole match.

He doesn‚Äôt have Rashy‚Äôs clutchness that could change matches in a single moment.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3qkr5,t1_jb3pgmh

It is not swiping them under the rug. I am accepting the defeat and moving on. Players need to do the same and fully focus on the next game. We know this team has a long way to go but being 3rd and winning a trophy this season is already ahead of our expectations after last years horrible season.

No one said we should forget. What really matters is how Ten Hag and our team react after the defeat. Winning Barcelona is a already a good sign for us.

"As I said, I'm not going to argue it'll be a successful season if we push on a bit more or that I've written off what has been done, but that result is a blight.

Right approach is being applied to refocus on the Betis match because there's no time to be moping around, but this one will live a long time in the memory.

"When Casemiro is at his best then sure. However, he didn't seem fully fit yesterday so playing someone as chaotic as Fred next to him is a terrible idea.

I agree about AWB, should have started yesterday. We should have also played Rashford, Garnacho, Bruno and Antony/Sancho in attack and try to counter-attack instead of doing what we did, but things could have still worked out well the way we set up, we weren't far from scoring in the first half.

Ok I agree with that. Maybe the perspective is lost on me.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3nf7u,t1_jb3m3n7
"I really see what you mean and I'm not saying this result is something that you should just dust off immediately. If we had the same result in the NLD id be fucking furious too.

But if you really put this in perspective like you said would you really rather have won the game and at the end of the season finished 5th or 6th? Of course theres still 12 games left but still.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3n0gx,t1_jb3lw34
"But that tactic worked pretty well until the Liverpool match. We beat Barcelona, Newcastle, and grind out results against other teams using that tactic.

There's only so much a tactic can do when players kept losing 50/50 and individual battles so easily.",Manchester United,Yes,jb45t36,t1_jb452zh
"Mixture of bad tactics, bad luck and mentality breakdown. Unfortunately no casemiro no party and he was clearly struggling with injury",Manchester United,Yes,jb45l6p,t1_jb4572t
"So he flops, whines, rolls around and throws tantrums because he's out it position. Hmm that's a new one. What about asking to be subbed? Is that because he's out of position too or because he wants to hide from the absolute thumping he's on the end of?",Manchester United,Yes,jb4ah2w,t1_jb4808q
"Its like kepa a couple seasons ago, he didn't make major howlers, the other team always just seemed to get lucky and score amazing goal after amazing goal against him. Turns out kepa was just shit that year and was doing all the basics wrong",Manchester United,Yes,jb4rxbm,t1_jb4lqoy
bruno was the worst one on pitch for me,Manchester United,Yes,jb4o90r,t1_jb4lqoy
"So why didn‚Äôt the goalie make a save. At least 3 goals were saveable.

"You try to play aggressive attacking football against an opponent that was ‚Äòweaker‚Äô. In that case I 100% get the choice for Dalot, even when his form is not that great. Was it a gamble to play aggressive, yes? Was it unlogical, definitely not. Did it pay off, no? That is not a mistake but a risk taken and gotten wrong. 
You can‚Äôt just write Dalot of because he is not as good anymore since his injury. You have to give them some faith to recover. 

The problem of yesterday was not the line up. It was pure mentality.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4mvdc,t1_jb4lu6y
Also played on the left which people seem to be ignoring regarding his performance.,Manchester United,Yes,jb64mi9,t1_jb61tld

"Casemiro looked like he was carrying injury or something, just didn't offer enough intensity and with Fred running around like a headless chicken next to him, we simply had no midfield.

In retrospect, if Casemiro wasn't okay then he shouldn't have started, but we don't have many options aside from him.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2zfqb,t1_jb2z20r
"Whilst everyone should hang their head in shame and have serious question marks asked about them, Casemiro and Varane have everything you can in the game and been at the elite level for many years. Martinez has been performing at a similar high level and won a decent amount for his age. All three pivotal in ending our trophy drought. The others though have either been nowhere near pivotal and/or been on the receiving end of performances like this many times. So when it comes down to making a statement and showing that this can't go on, sacrifices need to be made and the ones in the line of fire aren't going to be the three I've mentioned as at least they have a CV. 

So whilst I agree they are all at fault, certain ones have more damage on their record and they should be used to make am example, in times such as this.

Watching a video tape and a few harsh words isn't going to budge this rot. Ruthless removal and money will.",Manchester United,Yes,jb30w5z,t1_jb2z20r
do I?,Manchester United,Yes,jb3ufy2,t1_jb3uade
"Negative commentary is one thing.

Antony should be sold after this season.
Bruno needs to be shipped off.
Bruno shouldn't be captain.

"Ignore those types. Plastic fans anyway. 

We are having a remarkable season, over performing in every way. We got a taste of winning this year already & I think ETH has done such a good job, that many have forgotten just how good we are doing and they chalk it up to expectation. 

Reality is we were getting carried away. Thats a bloody good thing considering the doom and gloom from last season. Losing 7-0 is a disgusting defeat. I said before the game that the shoe is on the other foot almost, with how Liverpool are the ones with a desperate point to prove at home against the scarier team. The boys plainly werent ready to play that game and it showed with how they capitulated. 

Its a rocking defeat, but not a disaster. ETH will be livid, going through every single mistake and highlighting basically the entire match. It just wasnt good enough & the players know it. Now its up to them to either prove their own point, or stagnate and fall flat.",Manchester United,Yes,jb516ih,t1_jb4yfz7

Great argument there.,Manchester United,Yes,jb89g9v,t1_jb4zo0y
"What's your point? There's a reason I listed him sixth. That's in the  bottom half of our best XI. He's had high highs and low lows, just as I would have expected. Just because I don't see a future for him in a title winning team doesn't mean I don't think he can play pretty well for a team that is fine finishing 10-15 points behind the title winner.

I just don't rate the guy. No different to the countless posters on here who don't rate Maguire or De Gea but Maguire has no defence force and De Gea has a dwindled one so nobody gets called an idiot or agenda driven for not rating them,Manchester United,Yes,jb5gmq6,t1_jb5fn4x

"Yep, he's just waving his hands at his teammates after his OWN mistakes. How are they meant to feel good about that. Then you say teammates shouting back at him because they clearly don't respect him as a leader",Manchester United,Yes,jb3517d,t1_jb34bgk
"Varane 

He was yelling at the squad for not saying goodbye to awayfans at the end of the game. 

He is a calm and composed. But ruthless when need me. Bruno is petulant. Casemiro prone to yellow cards.",Manchester United,Yes,jb40vkh,t1_jb35wsr
Did you see him completely giving up yesterday. He's also basically won nothing of note everywhere he's played,Manchester United,Yes,jb5grc0,t1_jb5fgy8
"Antony has managed 3 goals and 0 assists in the PL. That is abysmal, it would be abysmal if he was 30m let alone double that. You can't be a wide player who only shoots and score so little.",Manchester United,Yes,jb51ouu,t1_jb4u9zf
Nah IMO winning the league is kind of thing that resets that kind of banter.,Manchester United,Yes,jb44mzj,t1_jb2uhg3

"Arsenal fans are rattled even from our shadow. I think people are over the moon because this is maybe the last time we are like this (with bad owners and needing investment on and off the pitch).

I have two very close friends who are Arsenal fans. Arsenal fans are cunts.,Manchester United,Yes,jb5ccm8,t1_jb557rj
"He has six goals but ok.

Six goals and an assist in 27 games, lmao. Gakpo joined in January and already has more league goals than Antony. 

Antony has also created just nine chances in the league. Total xA of 0.5. Zero completed crosses all season. Garnacho is 18 and in his first season, and has utterly outperformed him. Maybe you should get a grip and stop making excuses.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5j80d,t1_jb5g909
"Robben and Giggs were also two of the fastest players all time always ready to challenge the defenders. Antony just stands there, being one footed can only be excused when you are a truly special player such as Robben.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3txpc,t1_jb3tlgr
"All those flair brazilian players were physical spiecimens to be fair.

Even likes of Ronaldinho, Neymar they were fast and strong. You can have all technical ability in the world but if you are not fast and strong you are not beating your opponent. Sancho suffers from the same problem.",Manchester United,Yes,jb666w3,t1_jb64eft
"I know they were new signings but Varane or Casemiro, or tbh even DDG. He may not be vocal but he‚Äôs been at the club forever, is a nailed on starter and and surely has the respect of the squad. Bruno is not even in the top 10 for me.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3iz85,t1_jb3fzau
"We've seen it in the rare occasions where Martial has been fit, or when both Sancho and Antony have been fit, that Bruno still doesn't play in the 10.

But we'll see",Manchester United,Yes,jb4gepo,t1_jb4e6a1
Completely reactionary lol. Dalot in the first half of the season was second only to Trippier in terms of performance in the league. AWB post world cup has been brilliant. Good thing you're not in charge,Manchester United,Yes,jb4f3xg,t1_jb4ey6e
"Are you suggesting that Bruno being good excuses the rest from their creative responsibilities? 

All of Arsenal and City's wingers are creative on top of scoring goals.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6yijc,t1_jb6y60r
"So when Rashford or Ronaldo or Martial played there they didn't get rated either?

Cos this is for the whole season not just post world cup.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6ophe,t1_jb6o2ud
"Some are, some aren‚Äôt. The point is not that they‚Äôre not good players but when things get bad with them, they‚Äôre REALLY BAD.

These players have been a part of our humiliating defeats in the last few years. Obviously there is more but they didn‚Äôt play yesterday so I skipped them.

You have to look at the common denominators at some point and then it makes sense. 

Rashford stops running, head drops, never goes for 50/50 tackles or headers outside the box 

Fernandes starts complaining and diving, blaming his teammates and leaving his position 

McTominay starts clattering into people and getting yellows, spends rest of the game getting skipped past 

Shaw turns into drunk Buttner, becomes petulant on and off the ball, forgets how to mark and pass

Fred gets even more crazy and less strategic with his running, forgets any and all strategy 

De Gea retreats further and further into the goal to the point he‚Äôs standing inside of it, loses any presence in the box that he had in the first place, stops trying to make saves 


This list doesn‚Äôt include players that left obviously or players that didn‚Äôt play yesterday like AWB or Maguire.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5n6py,t1_jb5jnpa
"It was a mistake, but for whatever reason ETH decided he did not want to throw a 18 year old into the Anfield cauldron, and Sancho picked a lovely time to fall sick again. 

If ETH had a fit Martial and Sancho, and did what he did, I would be pissed.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3y0ez,t1_jb3w6u7
Stop acting like it's not been okay to call him out... he's been getting shit on from day 1,Manchester United,Yes,jb4e1c6,t1_jb4dxnd
"It depends. It‚Äôs all about what the marketing department (or whomever did the outsourced hiring) wants. Often times, tweets are actually pre-prepared and approved so that they fire off at the right time or outcome.",Manchester United,Yes,jb38oq6,t1_jb38cko
Sorry mate I‚Äôm a big United fan but Liverpool have definitely won the most trophies,Manchester United,Yes,jb4ovcn,t1_jb4oqtg

can‚Äôt be any worse than them torturing us with their pathetic excuse of a performance,Manchester United,Yes,jb2rqty,t1_jb2rn3f
"Antony hasn't showed that he's better than Pellistri so far. We can't counter with him, he doesn't have the ability to play first time passes if he's not on his favored leg and under no pressure. Most of the time he just passes back into midfield. I'd rather give Sancho, Pellistri or even Garnacho a chance at the RW before Antony right now. Yes I'm probably being very irrational but something has got to change, once teams mark Rashford out of the game we aren't scoring.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4eif5,t1_jb4dzi9
Yesterday aside Gakpo has not been great,Manchester United,Yes,jb4ed91,t1_jb4dtab
"Mate, don't drag Sancho in. He has been very good after he cane back for one. Secondly, he actually is a proper player who has performed in the Bundesliga (one of the top leagues and the CL)",Manchester United,Yes,jb4dz3i,t1_jb4dtab
And he plays more as a playmaker than a forward. So those are great numbers.,Manchester United,Yes,jb4e6l7,t1_jb4dx1t
"And yet he still didnt play good game of football from 1st minute and it looks like 3 months of invidual training didnt fix his physicality problem as he is getting outmuscled and outpaced every time.

I think its fine to criticise Sancho.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4e9a6,t1_jb4dx1t
"We can win the next 20 league titles, this will still haunt us.",Manchester United,Yes,jb48ke6,t1_jb48c6l
"He's still young in a new league and not even had a full year in the team, when you pay 90mill you aren't necessarily looking for an instant impact it's a long term investment and he already has 8 goals and 3 assists in his first season.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4jjga,t1_jb4i2n7
"I don't care if he can't skin players.

90% of the attacks that go down his side end up in a poor shot.

His defensive work rate is not even elite. He's about average in that in all the metrics, Tackles, Interceptions, Blocks etc are all under the 50th percentile.

Here are the things that he is the WORST in the league at (2nd to 10th percentile).

Fouls won, Key passes, Assists, XAG ,Goal creating actions, crossing into the box.

He needs to improve a lot and fast at a lot of things because its not even average at this point.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5zz3y,t1_jb5w6dh
His defensive contribution is just one part. He can hold down the right side on his own and stretch play which allows for quick switch of plays. It works really well when Bruno is in the middle.,Manchester United,Yes,jb62ygg,t1_jb5w6dh
"Shit happens, u whine and blame but u don't strip someone off for one game performance. U have to consider what they have done here so far as well. Ten hag is type of manager who won't throw anyone under the bus in public but I'm sure behind scenes he is tearing each of them apart. This loss isn't just on Bruno every player on the field had one of their worst performances. Bruno is the captain yeah, but there were 10 other on the field who also held their head down instead of fighting back, they are all grown men under same coach are we expecting Bruno to babysit them?",Manchester United,Yes,jb3q300,t1_jb3po81

"You've misinterpreted this a lot. I'm basically saying that it was obvious that we weren't ready to challenge yet as a top level team mentally. It's not about what I was expecting to come out of this, it's about how I knew that we shouldn't of got ahead of ourselves too early.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6bz1f,t1_jb6bp3t

"He literally plays 90+ minutes every few days, every other player gets subbed or gets games off. How is it stupid to expect poor performances if this continues",Manchester United,Yes,jb54u5m,t1_jb53m16
"I like him, I don‚Äôt really get angry either way, I don‚Äôt mind him trying 19 shite things because he WILL inevitably produce that 20th amazing thing, and I think some of the complaints about his ‚Äúantics‚Äù can be overblown (and are things 90% of players regularly get up to). 

all that being said he was absolutely the worst version of himself yesterday",Manchester United,Yes,jb54zum,t1_jb53384
I think you summed it up perfectly mate. I think if we re to go to the next level i think we have to upgrade on bruno,Manchester United,Yes,jb54r4h,t1_jb53384
"He wouldn't be unbelievably overrated if this sub didn't think he was world class. He has massive shortcomings in his game that affect how we play even outside of the big games. There's not a player like Bruno in a top level team for a reason, he's too wild. It's part of why EtH shunts him out wide IMO",Manchester United,Yes,jb5879w,t1_jb57kwl
"And you see how much different we are without Casemiro right? As good as he is, he is still ageing, and he plays every single game for us, we can't rely on him forever to hold down the midfield. De Gea has saved our ass multiple times this year with his shotstopping, I'm more than happy to rely on him until we sort out our dogshit striker and midfield situation",Manchester United,Yes,jb5g1l4,t1_jb5fjlz
"Yeah but even if that‚Äôs true, how is Sabitzer going to stop Casemiro from giving away every pass in that game?",Manchester United,Yes,jb3pwx8,t1_jb3pp7c
"If Antony also helped by pressing or making a tackle, maybe Dalot would have been able to go back and mark Gakpo instead of Fred having to come back leaving a big hole. Anyway we should have prevented Robertson from making the pass.",Manchester United,Yes,jb464g0,t1_jb45tiv
"new deal is gonna be on way lower than his current wages, no1 is negotiating for 375k a week and even de gea knows this. He knows even if he is paid 200k -250k here there is no way other club pays him more than that.",Manchester United,Yes,jb46vm7,t1_jb46rn1

That's an example of toxic positivity

Here's a definition of toxic positivity:

>Toxic positivity is¬†the pressure to only display positive emotions, suppressing any negative emotions, feelings, reactions, or experiences. It invalidates human experience and can lead to trauma, isolation, and unhealthy coping mechanisms.

This sub absolutely inculcates a culture of toxic positivity by not allowing for measured criticism of its favourites, i.e. Bruno is regarded as a very flawed player on RedCafe but world class and above criticism on here",Manchester United,Yes,jb66ij7,t1_jb65l2h
Did you miss the part where we scored 0 goals ? It contributes to that,Manchester United,Yes,jb4gj5h,t1_jb4g35n
"No but it has to do with us not creating much with him on the pitch. He has as many goals as Martial and Fred, one more than Sancho, but creates nothing for anyone but himself. 

We have a counter and Antony gets the ball, boom, counter is dead. 

This is daily discussion, not the post match thread. Anything said about Antony is not just what we noticed last game but all season so far.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4gokc,t1_jb4g35n
What asinine shit? He demands full effort and has high standards for one of the biggest clubs in the world. His straight talk is right 99% of the time. The truth hurts.,Manchester United,Yes,jb3ql7b,t1_jb3qfj4

"I might not be fond of certain players but that doesn't mean I'll single them out after a shit performance, and if they've played well, I'll praise them. 

If I state McTominay is not a United quality player, it's not an agenda, I'm stating facts. 

But if I'm only going on at Antony or Dalot or Bruno irrespective of their performance, that means having an agenda. 

Sorry, but I don't hold agendas, I'm very straightforward in that regard.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5f789,t1_jb5e8ii

Garnacho never played well on RW even in academy years

So yeah im my opinion unless Sancho fixes his problem we are stuck with Antony.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4f30o,t1_jb4eif5
Sancho has 14 G+A in 59 games in his United career. That‚Äôs absolutely shite for a ¬£80m winger,Manchester United,Yes,jb4jb68,t1_jb4dz3i
Sancho when consistently played can genuinely be one of the most exciting players. This year he's had bigger issues than football so it's not a fair representation of him Imo. Genuinely believe if we start him on the right we see much better football. He's not gonna do any of this hold up ball roll nonsense Antony does,Manchester United,Yes,jb4e9zq,t1_jb4e6l7
What? Did you watch last year at all? Sancho was our best player for a lot of the second half. Even this year when he's been largely a sub he's been scoring important goals. You're literally judging him off of a few minutes here and there,Manchester United,Yes,jb4egme,t1_jb4e9a6

"Well that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre just flat out wrong. I get that he‚Äôs not responsible for his own price tag, but in what world is a 90mil player not one where you expect an instant impact? That‚Äôs just outrageous.",Manchester United,Yes,jb4s92b,t1_jb4jjga
"Disagree. He‚Äôs too one footed, extremely slow for a winger, average close control and average vision. These problems are not going to go away, they‚Äôre going to get worse as defenders figure him out even more",Manchester United,Yes,jb64krj,t1_jb4jjga
"Right, yeah, he should improve on his crossing which would yield assists, expected assists and a couple of the other ones you mentioned.

Individual stats on the defensive side that focus on duels don't give the full picture imo. Otherwise Ibrahim Sangar√© would be a world beater. They don't properly capture the way closing down forces the opponent to shift the ball elsewhere. And they would be lower in %ile terms for sides like ours with more possession",Manchester United,Yes,jb67j2t,t1_jb5zz3y
"> Shit happens, u whine and blame but u don't strip someone off for one game performance. U have to consider what they have done here so far as well.

> Bruno is the captain yeah, but there were 10 other on the field who also held their head down instead of fighting back, they are all grown men under same coach are we expecting Bruno to babysit them?

The captain needs to be held to a higher standard when it comes to attitude and mentality. I am not expecting him to babysit anyone, but I am expecting him to lead by example. And the example he set is exactly the opposite of what a Manchester United captain should do when we're getting hammered by any team, let alone our biggest rivals.",Manchester United,Yes,jb3qs2n,t1_jb3q300

"We are nowhere near a top level club but we have beaten Barca, City, Arsenal, Liverpool ,Spurs and already won a trophy?

We are not closed to a finished product by any means but get a grip.

Aston Villa put 7 past Liverpool too a couple of seasons back. Freak results happen. Fergie lost to City horribly at home.

Its what happens after that matters.

Only thing that will matter in the end is the GD which may factor into getting top 4 but we are in the driver's seat for that.

We came back after the City loss and we'll do it again.",Manchester United,Yes,jb6cxaw,t1_jb6bz1f
He's been awful for weeks at this point. Regularly our worst player on the pitch. Obviously he's got ability so he's always going to be able to string together some good form but due to his brain he's always going to be erratic and will have plenty of poor form like this recent run because of it unless the team is built around him. The only football he suits is counter attacking where his Hollywood balls are less wasteful because we've built our team around just soaking up pressure rather than trying to control a game. You can't do that with a Bruno in the team,Manchester United,Yes,jb59aao,t1_jb58937
"And if people actually watch games (most of this sub doesn't, as they are too busy posting in match threads to see what's happening in the game) they'd notice that even in minute 90 of most matches he's the one running like a dog even if the game is won. He's rarely subbed, he never gets a rest. Of course, none of that excuses his behavior, which IMO is a far bigger issue than his performance. You can have a shit game where nothing goes your way, but you still keep your wits about you and don't throw tantrums or risk a red card.",Manchester United,Yes,jb57yvi,t1_jb54u5m
"At his best he gets around a goal or assist every game. And its not just numbers, at his best he's genuinely the creative hub of the team. 

If you think that is unbelievably overrated, then you are an idiot or have an agenda against the guy. These are your words, you didn't say he's unreliably overrated, you said even at his best he's unbelievably overrated when that is just not true. 

At his best he's as creative and impactful as any attacking midfielder in the world. 

Was he at that level last season? Obviously not. Has he gotten closer this season? At times, but still not at that peak. Also I'd say this season part of the issue is that no one finishes the chances he creates, except Rashford. But then again no one has really called Bruno world class since that initial spell he had when he was insane. Even if he's praised there's usually a caveat.

As for ETH playing him wide, it has nothing to do with him being good or not. Steven Gerrard was played at RW and then as a second striker by Benitez. Was he not world class either because he wouldn't play his favorite CM position?

Truth is that he comes across as a petulant idiot when things don't go his way, so he's easy to dislike and blame when the entire team is not doing well. I was unhappy with his attitude in the game, but he's not the reason we lost 7-0. If our back four and Casemiro play like professionals, we don't lose 7-0, simple as.",Manchester United,Yes,jb5az6l,t1_jb5879w

"The point is no top club would have him as their Numero Uno. That‚Äôs the point.

No one is asking Antony to cross the ball all the time. But he's done it 23 times so far and not managed to get it on a player's head even once.

I know it's a taboo to most fans to criticize bruno in any way, but with us 3goals down with 36minutes left to play, I looked for our captain to be going around calming his teammates down, reminding them that losing here wasn't the end of our season, but he was leading the petulant frustration brigade. Throwing himself on the ground at any opportunity he got. Whining non stop to the refs, half hearted attempts to at least keep up with his man. His head was completely gone and he was petulantly half-arsing it. This hurt me. Few mins later, rashford following the footsteps of the captain couldn't even be bothered to sprint 5yards to put pressure on henderson steadying himself for a cross. Ofcourse henderson crossed unchallenged and darwin nunez got his second goal. These actions hurt me more than the result. Bruno when we needed leaders was the most childish player out there on the pitch. We could have lost this game but still maintained some level of dignity if the players didn't completely lose their heads out there and bruno who was supposed to be our captain was the greatest culprit.

Wan is playing well atm, but has serious limitations in attack that Ten Hag can never fix only improve. 

Dalot is frustrating, can't find any consistency, always one good thing followed by one bad thing, we switch between the two because none truly offer what we need.

Please don't tell me, 'Dalot has improved and is now worthy', as a man who has watched football for a long time i can tell you when Rafinia joined Leeds many were saying his good he was, (surprised we didn't sign him), THAT, is the level up that we as fans should be acknowledging.

A world class RB will very much show you and potentially the new generation how much this position can be improved, I feel like the new fans see what our RB's are doing and don't realise this position for United has historically had some of the best players we've ever had that change games on their own.

This is not sustainable and it needs to change.

"The march thread was so toxic. Could we have some perspective please? 

It was an off day, I don't think ETH got his tactical setup **completely** wrong because on balance we actually had the better chances in the first half. 

However in the second half I think he waited too long to react, and eventually we couldn't stem the tide any more. That's on him, no excuses there.

The players did drop their heads but frankly I can't find the heart to blame them **too** much  - they've navigated a long and arduous season extremely well (and with such a great attitude too), and it wasn't until they probably felt a result was beyond them before they threw in the towel mentally. Anyone who's ever been involved in any sport has probably felt the same way at some point. 

Liverpool were extremely motivated to beat us because what else can they play for? Especially Gakpo - he looked like he had an axe to grind, and fair play to him. 

The weather was a huge factor too I think. The soggy pitch really hampered our usual quick passing style & effectively destroyed our counter-attacking hopes (though again, ETH should've tried something different). Also the resultant deflections were absolutely ridiculous. I can't believe how much luck Liverpool had for the ball to fall their way so many times. Just absurd. 

We were due to lose a match, and all things considered this was the best competition to get a loss in. It really sucks that it had to be to Liverpool but better to lose at Anfield than to a more beatable team at Old Trafford.

I'm more than hopeful that the team can bounce back because they did it earlier this season already, and the spirit in the squad is clearly better than it's ever been for the better part of 7-8 years.

I would hate to see him go to Real 5-6 years from now and give them his best years, just like a certain someone. I have always thought selling Ronaldo to a club like Real was a massive mistake since it propelled them to glories that set them apart. Real is still enjoying the domino effects of those successes until now imo because it makes them more attractive to players and it generated tons of money for them on and off the field. Basically we nurtured and developed Ronaldo for them. Tottenham did the same with Modric and Bale for Real. Maybe it can‚Äôt be helped that Ronaldo is Portuguese and Garnacho is Argentinian but this is a problem no matter how you look at it, albeit a long-term one.

This is one positive I got out of ETH (and also quite concerning too).

"Arsenal fan coming in peace. I only meant to lurk but your comment intrigued me as an interesting discussion. Our rivalry was only because we were the best teams in the world, with the two of the best PL managers of all time, with some of the best PL players of all time. The things both our clubs did in those years is the stuff of legends. It's only natural our rivalry was intense. Similar to your rivalry with Liverpool. Liverpool United Arsenal are the OG giants.

And we know what we did to be the best. We got our success organically, buying prospects and developing players and then Chelsea followed by City and bought ready made players with fuck you money. 

So I really can't support City winning over anyone else because of what they represent. That you can buy success, and if you can buy success it doesn't matter who you hurt along the way, and i'm not taking about other clubs or players i'm talking about their owners. The media and the fans will just look away whether you are a murdering oligarch or a slave trader, as long as you are successful.

I grew up with the United vs arsenal rivalry, but neither of us have been pulling up trees for a long time prior to this season. I don‚Äôt spend much time on social media (other than checking here for news), so I couldn‚Äôt give a monkeys how vocal a bunch of arsenal supporters are that I‚Äôve never met.

The alternative is City (our actual rivals, albeit not so loud when they were relying on Shawn goater every week) equaling our threepeat and continuing their domestic dominance. 

Before anyone says ‚Äúcity don‚Äôt count, they‚Äôre state owned‚Äù, just be aware of what is likely to happen in the near future (I know that we don‚Äôt need the money like city did, but I assume that rival fans won‚Äôt care). 

It‚Äôs been so long since arsenal were last relevant, that this is almost akin to when Leicester had their one-off league win.

Fuck that. The people talking about these human rights abuses are rival fans who would take Qatar at their club in a heartbeat. It‚Äôs all posturing and jealousy,Manchester United,Yes,jb1glgz,t1_jb1ekhm
How was tonight's performance the fault of the owners?,Manchester United,Yes,jb1h51q,t1_jb1ekhm
"That‚Äôs how we should look at games, I agree. But today was a rivalry, people will need to get the frustration and anger out.",Manchester United,Yes,jb1g2l8,t1_jb1epxj
"Yeah, looked like Ten Hag just gave up and shoved him on for the last 30. He cannot be our CDM against anyone above Championship teams, he needs to be sold in the summer to be honest as he isn‚Äôt good enough to be trusted as a depth option either.",Manchester United,Yes,jb1jizx,t1_jb1j675
Yeah there is no way we should be removing one of our most vital players from the midfield.  It literally cripples our creativity for the sole purpose of Bruno being able to put in a cross sometimes... what? Bruno on the wings needs to stop.  It was the same crap with Pogba LW,Manchester United,Yes,jb1nyea,t1_jb1mro8
You have to be a season ticket holder for several years before you eligible for away ticket,Manchester United,Yes,jazqgsk,t1_jazkqhe

">worse than any defeats we've had in the games in the last season

joint worst United defeat since 19 fucking 31",Manchester United,Yes,jb1xmr8,t1_jb1n3qm
Yeah thats what I do not get. Its one thing if we were drawing and losing games all this while. What the fuck happened tbh. It wasn‚Äôt like our player was sent off and we played with 10 players. That could explain a lot. Not like we lost Varane the way we did against city and basically lost the game after that.,Manchester United,Yes,jb1v8a5,t1_jb1n3qm

"There are about five hundred ex-Liverpool players all over the media, and there has been for as long as I can remember.

From Ian St. John and Alan Hansen to fucking Stephen Warnock (for some, inexplicable reason). And the one thing they can all be counted on is being bitter and blinkered about United.",Manchester United,Yes,jb0lfg6,t1_jb06cym

"I'm upset too but to be fair to them, they've also responded well to going behind between the City game and now. The early second-half goal against Leeds was the only real shocker I remember and even then, the reaction was admirable. Today was woeful but not characteristic of United since the early collapses.

I agree that I saw too much of ""the old United"" in that capitulation and I want to see everybody working to eradicate that mindset.",Manchester United,Yes,jb1vbvh,t1_jb1ryrr
"We have gone a goal down and made come back this season so many times, today‚Äôs result feels like an anomaly of the largest order.",Manchester United,Yes,jb1upxi,t1_jb1ryrr
Absolutely zero structure. It‚Äôs like the players forgot how to play all of a sudden.,Manchester United,Yes,jb1gczu,t1_jb1ewol
"Its just a painful defeat that would stuck in our mind for the rest of the season. But a defeat like this would always be a blessing in disguise for a team with right mentality. Don't forget that our main priority for EPL is to secure top 4 which we firmly install ourselves there now. 

Let's this game be the game that instill further winning mentality for our coming cup games in FA and UEL. Let's get back at them next season.",Manchester United,Yes,jb28sg0,t1_jb25cz3
"If you‚Äôre a hockey Fan, Ilya Bryzgolov once said ‚Äúit‚Äôs only game, why you have to be mad?‚Äù",Manchester United,Yes,jb2buct,t1_jb25cz3
"Definitely. Quality of the league as a whole and attackers has increased exponentially over the last 10 years. 

Also, the skill gap between great managers and the teams they create with the massive funds they have access to and average/poor managers in the league is bigger than it‚Äôs ever been.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2qki0,t1_jb2n5k2
"Agreed, this will be an incredible wake up call. We needed that, complacency was creeping into our game the last few matches. Just shows we need proper depth players next season too.",Manchester United,Yes,jb1hvqw,t1_jb1gbkn
He‚Äôs played in goal for some of our worst defeats in history over the last few seasons. He gets zero free passes. He does not deserve a new contrast on 250k a week,Manchester United,Yes,jb24w6a,t1_jb23mi4
"His distribution was genuinely terrible today. He completed less than 50% of his passes and that puts so much pressure on our back line and we couldn‚Äôt win the 2nd balls for his hoofs up the pitch today either. They had chance after chance because of that today.

Also as long as he‚Äôs been here he‚Äôs been terrible at his near post and nothing has changed. 

Ten Hag will be wanting to move on in the summer",Manchester United,Yes,jb2f26h,t1_jb23mi4
"Good point, but then for me januzaj is the warning of relying on talent breaking out too much.

Fergie did it absolutely right holding Ronaldo back when he was younger and I'm glad ETH is keeping garnacho on the bench a lot despite how well he is playing.

I'm convinced teams relying on teens raw talent starting them week in and out from the age of 17 onwards leads.to players careers ending early like Rooney or chronic injury problems like Phil Jones. 

Theres dozens of examples of great looking talents whose bodies just broke down far too early to get consistency before they were supposed to be in their prime.",Manchester United,Yes,jazkc13,t1_jazcs34
Who do we think needs replacing for next season from the squad?,Manchester United,Yes,jb1hz9e,t1_jb1g73h
"Not too nervous... but I think it'll be a hard fight. I think we have a pretty good chance to win, one of the best chances in many years, but I'd probably take a draw if offered because the most important thing is to keep LFC from winning, keep them from top 4. üëø",Manchester United,Yes,jb01iug,t1_jazzps7
I see trouble on the way,Manchester United,Yes,jb0ir36,t1_jb0hm3x
"we played pretty well most of the game, just been smashed on the counter. Appears VAR isnt working today either not that it would affect the score.",Manchester United,Yes,jb1b7yb,t1_jb1aozm

"I miss the days when internet forums were thing, i dont know how it was in other lenguages but here in poland we had ta heavly moderated forums with high quality disccussion. They all died out, no new users and orignal ones got older

"Nope.   So you get champions league for finishing top 4, or for winning the CL or Europa League.    If you win one of the cups and finish in the top 4, then that extra spot is forfeit rather than passed down the ladder (which used to happen).  

If you win a cup and finish outside of the top 4, then England would get 5 teams into the champions league next season.      

However a country can have a maximum of 5 teams in the champions league.  So if 2 english clubs won the CL and Europa but both finished outside the top 4, then only the top 3 would qualify.    4th place would become a Europa qualification.",Manchester United,Yes,jazelwb,t1_jaz9qgm
No. Only time a team outside of top4 gets CL is if they win the EL or CL,Manchester United,Yes,jazak0l,t1_jaz9qgm
The fifth team only gets in (by winning Europa) if they don't finish in the top 4.,Manchester United,Yes,jazfut9,t1_jaz9qgm
"Think if it this way: A club only gets champions league on merit. So finishing top4 or winning one of CL or EL. A club doesn't get handed a spot for failing to achieve these goals, just because another team was successful.",Manchester United,Yes,jazqsfj,t1_jaz9qgm
"Yeah, there‚Äôs a possibility Liverpool can get CL(and Jude) if us or arsenal wins EL

Varane comes to mind,Manchester United,Yes,jb1l5bs,t1_jb1kfv3
"It was unlucky to an extent, but they were faster to every single second ball. We looked like we were playing in sand compared to them. Mixture of fatigue and complacency.",Manchester United,Yes,jb1icgz,t1_jb1hmgx
So is the infestation from other subs.,Manchester United,Yes,jb1quxf,t1_jb1pu6x
"Dont be so reactionary. I think Weghorst is a good back up, De Gea has saved our asses many times, and Dalot started this season well and is coming back from an injury. Chill",Manchester United,Yes,jb2hiy4,t1_jb22z12
Nobody wants him as a first choice striker. Come next year hopefully we will have someone better up top. He is a decent option off the bench. He wouldn‚Äôt be starting for us if Martial was fit even now mate.,Manchester United,Yes,jb22x5k,t1_jb229vf
"Nah, Liverpool are starting their transition. Firminho leaving. Salah will be gone soon too. They know they‚Äôre in for a few tough years. I have my doubts about Klopp sticking around too. 

We will beat them there next season. 

Our team won‚Äôt look the same either but we are further along in making changes.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2ba1o,t1_jb22s0b
The Qataris are on it. Sad but true. Don't want it to be but it is. Our team in 3 years will be different. Them too.,Manchester United,Yes,jb2qrm8,t1_jb22s0b
"Agreed. Mentality is a buzzword but you will never catch any other so called top side collapsing to their rivals in a game like this. It does indicate that there is something more seriously wrong than we thought, and even with the new players the same mentality can exist amongst the team. Don‚Äôt want to exaggerate but it is a serious issue that needs to be dealt with. Winning trophies will definitely help, however.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2c644,t1_jb24k2g
Eh. The title is hyperbolic but reading the article it wasn‚Äôt too bad. Our resurgence has been put on temporary hold. Just proves to the players and ETH that there is a lot of work needing to be done until we can consider ourselves a top side.,Manchester United,Yes,jb2bryk,t1_jb26vw8
"Yep. Realistically the only major repercussion from this will be Pool fans taking the piss and the potential for it to derail the tail end of our season. We‚Äôve responded to losses well once before at the start of the season, we can do it again. 

Good reality check for the fans too.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2aq96,t1_jb2agbs

"Olise, for me. Both footed, can play both wings, direct.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2qekr,t1_jb2opof
Diaby is who I wish we‚Äôd have signed as the main rw. We might as well see what we have with amad and sancho,Manchester United,Yes,jb2stgd,t1_jb2opof
"As in a replacement? Because the alternative to Antony is another expensive winger we already have, Sancho",Manchester United,Yes,jb37kg4,t1_jb2opof
Loss is not an issue. Giving up after 1st half is the actual topic of concern.,Manchester United,Yes,jb1s1kd,t1_jb1rr6w
People were laughing at Nunez because they see his miss compilations. I have seen him run all the way back to clear a header from a counter attack. He is a top player.,Manchester United,Yes,jb1w6en,t1_jb1vneu
It was automatically unpinned but I have repinned it,Manchester United,Yes,jazcboy,t1_jaz952r
Because the team is built on emotions,Manchester United,Yes,jb24vs4,t1_jb1uuen
"I don‚Äôt have a lot of time for Neville or anything he has to say. 

But for me Bruno is not captain material and he‚Äôs playing out of position and playing too many games.",Manchester United,Yes,jb2cbs6,t1_jb2113s
"Who‚Äôs in goal for most, if not all of those games?",Manchester United,Yes,jb22fao,t1_jb2113s
"we‚Äôre not getting another right winger and we won‚Äôt be getting another right back

Striker, midfielder, back up DM and goalkeeper will be the priorities",Manchester United,Yes,jb1y9py,t1_jb1xay9
"Honestly I thought this was Martinez‚Äôs worst game for us, uncharacteristically as he is usually stellar and one of the best CBs in the league. 

He‚Äôll make it right next game though.",Manchester United,Yes,jb1jrow,t1_jb1hfii
"Fekir is out right? I know he‚Äôs their most important player but they have quality across the pitch too. Would be fantastic team to bounce back against. 

Aren‚Äôt they also extremely dirty, even for a La Liga team?",Manchester United,Yes,jb2axt0,t1_jb29jtx
"Fekir is out right? I know he‚Äôs their most important player but they have quality across the pitch too. Would be fantastic team to bounce back against.

"Yeah, bad things the state did decades ago are so relevant to people criticising what another state is currently doing.",Manchester United,Yes,jb0a4y3,t1_jazy3te
"Such a backwards argument. I'm not defending the way Britain acted in the 1800's but how can you say oh well you guys used to invade and pillage countries and disregard human rights so fuck it, why does it matter if other countries do it now?

The fact is the world has moved on in a huge amount of areas and Qatar should absolutely not be treating migrant workers the way they do, basically modern day slavery. Also their LGBTQ outlook and laws are horrific. You're born gay just as much as you are born black or white. Trying to oppress people on those grounds is a horrendous way to govern no matter what some old books say.",Manchester United,Yes,jazys6g,t1_jazy3te
"The UK state (ie, the people who perpetrated those atrocities) aren't the people criticising Qatar though are they. It's regular people who aren't guilty of those atrocities and don't approve of those atrocities that are criticising Qatar. If regular citizens are guilty of the crimes of their countries (past or present) then I really hope your country has a clean conscience.

This flimsy whataboutism doesn't somehow make Qatar any less of a human rights abuser. Especially given that they currently are actively perpetrating those human rights abuses rather than having done so decades or centuries before which is the case you're levelling at the UK.",Manchester United,Yes,jb06592,t1_jazy3te
The difference I suppose is the oil states are committing the atrocities in the present day. You're not going to blame arab countries for the atrocities of the Ottoman Empire are you?,Manchester United,Yes,jazy9j7,t1_jazy3te
"That's in the past dude, how much can you hold an individual responsible for their ancestors actions?

What's happening in Qatar is happening right now.

Sorry lad, but that's a really bad take.",Manchester United,Yes,jazyzps,t1_jazy3te
People here refering how Qatar is doing stuff now while conveniently ignoring what England is today is because of stuff they did back then,Manchester United,Yes,jazzghp,t1_jazy3te
"The British caused a genocide in my country(India) and millions of people lost their lives in the Bengal famine. The effects of this are still felt today in our(south Asian) genetics we accumulate fat in our belly rather than around the body.

However I don‚Äôt believe the owners of Manchester United nor the players or fans had anything to do with it at that time. I really don‚Äôt know the extent of Qatars involvement in shady issues though. The migrant worker issue is not as black and white as people make out to be. I‚Äôve seen complaints that the migrant workers had terrible living conditions and western media were gawking over the condition of the restrooms. The thing is living conditions in most of India where these migrant workers are from are perhaps worse. The money you make by going to Qatar is significantly more than what you would make in India as a construction worker.
 
If western people really wanted to virtue signal they should vote for politicizes that allow more migrant south Asians in.

A little bit of perspective. When I was growing up the kid with all the fancy toys was someone who‚Äôs father used to work in Qatar as a construction manager. So what I‚Äôm saying is it‚Äôs not black or white as what people like John Oliver want you to believe.",Manchester United,Yes,jb0bgfg,t1_jazy3te
"""Great"" Britain is a reference to the land mass, not implying awesomeness.

Qatar has laws now that execute people for being different and is largely run on the almost slavery of migrant workers.

Great Britain has never owned or attempted to buy a football club.

But lets not bother comparing like with like.",Manchester United,Yes,jazyzrs,t1_jazy3te
"> would significantly dwarf those of all oil states combined

Have you never heard of their slave trade?",Manchester United,Yes,jb01g8v,t1_jazy3te
"I agree - people say ‚Äúoh well it happened ages ago and we have nothing to do with it now‚Äù, yet such countries continue to reap the generational wealths and benefits that centuries of pillaging and violence brought them.

If you‚Äôre going to point fingers and say you can‚Äôt do this and that, then you have to acknowledge the fact that you are still benefitting from the atrocities committed in the past and most importantly, relinquish such benefits. Otherwise it‚Äôs all just talk. It‚Äôs like someone robbing a bank 10 years ago and enjoying all the stolen money and passing it down to future generations whilst having the audacity to say that others can‚Äôt do it.

But of course, no country is going to willingly cripple their country because morality has always taken the back seat.

Countries like Qatar are doing what they think is necessary to play catch-up to countries like the US and UK. None of that is to say that the atrocities committed in places like Qatar are to be excused. Slavery should not exist today nor should it have ever existed in the past.

All I am saying is that just because a country is committing atrocities now does not make them any more evil than countries that did it in the past. They‚Äôre all just as bad as each other.",Manchester United,Yes,jb0jzhy,t1_jazy3te
this feels like a response typed by roy keane and i love it,Manchester United,Yes,jb1wa7o,t1_jb1rrzh
I just don‚Äôt see it happening. I don‚Äôt think he suits the Prem with his lack of physicality and pace as a fullback. He also wouldn‚Äôt want to be a deep rotation option so there‚Äôs really no point.,Manchester United,Yes,jb08871,t1_jb07q1v
If we can make ¬£10m out of him I'd be delighted.,Manchester United,Yes,jb0ggoa,t1_jb07q1v

"I was most surprised about how poor Casemiro was. Wasn‚Äôt effectively shielding the defence, tackling was slow and poor range of passing too. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be great next game but I was shocked to see that, admittedly he wasn‚Äôt getting much help and was getting overrun in midfield. 

Think this will shock them all back to their senses",Manchester United,Yes,jb1kfw8,t1_jb1k2pt
"Yes, those hypes need to be stopped. We cannot say Man United is back after just one Carabao Cup. I've heard something like ""ETH is the best coach, Dalot is one of the best fullbacks itw, Rashford is the best player..."".  
All of them are not true, it's a shame to say those. We need big titles to get recognized.",Manchester United,Yes,jb1jrxu,t1_jb1gsps

yup. Mount is being ridiculed like Rashford was last year. Woudnt be surprised to see him tear it up next season and leave his detractors with egg on their faces,Manchester United,Yes,jazuo5r,t1_jazt1qx
You cannot expect people to stay levelheaded after a SEVEN FUCKING NIL loss. This result will live on forever in the history books. I don't agree with everything that's being said but people are justifiably angry.,Manchester United,Yes,jb1nerr,t1_jb1m4r8

Losing 7-0 means he got his tactics spectacularly wrong.,Manchester United,Yes,jb22xqf,t1_jb1mpjd
"The weather?  C'mon let's not embarrass ourselves any further today. 

As for whether the boys have earned our trust, well the way I see it is there are several players who need replacing... it's a very fine line where when the big performers play well like Casemiro, Rashford, Bruno, Licha, they can drag some of our other players up, but when they aren't at the races, the last people you want to be relying on is the likes of Dalot, Fred, even Shaw is in danger of putting himself in this category and DDG needs to go as well.  Makes some camera saves but brings nothing else to this team... nothing.   I could go in very hard on several others too.",Manchester United,Yes,jb1pq4w,t1_jb1mpjd

"Mate come off it with the overreaction. It was a terrible loss, but look how far we‚Äôve come from 8 months ago.

Fucking horrible take. He‚Äôs been one of the best LB‚Äôs in Europe for multiple seasons. He had one bad game. None of these reactionary piss takes,Manchester United,Yes,jb1iqp1,t1_jb1hzei
"He was terrible today but he was carrying an injury going into this game, also he‚Äôs been one of the best LBs in the world the last year or two, genuinely one of the best players on our team. 

He‚Äôll have time to recover and learn from this too.",Manchester United,Yes,jb1j3ts,t1_jb1hzei
"I don't think Shaw was singly the reason for those losses.

Similarly De Gea has been how many these now? I don't think we can single him out and say he is the reason we are shit in times like these",Manchester United,Yes,jb1n5mr,t1_jb1hzei
"No way, Dalot has had plenty of good games. Sept - November 2022 Dalot was one of our best performers consistently opening up our right side and overlapping. He‚Äôs best in the middle third though, and so doesn‚Äôt do the flashy runs or crosses that other more attacking fullbacks do. Admittedly he had a terrible game today though, no excuses",Manchester United,Yes,jb1nlf7,t1_jb1n0q4

AWB has been more than solid for many months and has shown great growth. We have two good right backs. We don't have a single striker. And there are so many positions we don't have a back up for. Right back is the last of our worries.,Manchester United,Yes,jazj7ed,t1_jazivdv
"I'm not sure what with some people here that want to change our RB when our striker and midfield situation is infinitely more dire. Maybe we fix that first before even thinking about doing anything with RB, which also one of the other position that actually sorted out?",Manchester United,Yes,jaznepf,t1_jazivdv

"Unfortunately there's nothing we can do about it.   For many from South America, Spain and Portugal they have huge ties to Real Madrid or Barca.  It's.just a act of life and nothing we can do about it unfortunately.

"I believe Rooney was a bit of an exception. 

Rooney, unlike most generational talents, sacrificed a lot for the team. He played second fiddle to first Van Nistelrooy, then Ronaldo and then Van Persie, only got 3 seasons as the out and out striker of the team, which was his best position. He would run back, defend deep, press, shunted through the wings just to accommodate someone else.

The second problem was himself. Man did not care for his body. I'm talking about binge drinking and lack of proper diet and recovery. I genuinely believe if Rooney had taken good care of himself he could've easily played till 35 in his favored central striker position here (maybe not first choice).",Manchester United,Yes,jazsln7,t1_jazkc13

If we didn't go toe to toe with Arsenal for season after season, they would be viewed as Crystal Palace are.

As I understand, charges have been dropped due to lack of legal evidence, so Greenwood surely needs to continue to deny any wrongdoing?

I think the likelihood is that Greenwood/ his lawyers will be sticking to a story which will ‚Äúclear up‚Äù the events, attempting to prove that he is innocent. 

Seems like there are 2 options:

1) The club conclude that they don‚Äôt believe him and/ or he is not worth the risk. He therefore never plays for the club again.

2) The club do believe him and/ or want to give him another chance, in which case he will forever be presented as innocent, however rival fans and a significant amount of United fans will continue to think otherwise.

Personally, I was still very uncomfortable with him playing, but at least there was a genuine argument given he denied the evidence.

With Greenwood, there is clear audio of him raping his partner with accompanying photographic evidence. It‚Äôs just more obvious, damning and less refutable than Ronaldos.

Working in the corporate world, has shown me that MG will likely play for us again and the PR spin is about to put us all in a tizzy (think along the lines of role play, it was fake blood for a halloween costume, he was playfighting with her, etc) and she may come out with a performance worthy of an Oscar (it‚Äôs been a nightmare people trying to destroy our family, an ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù black man wrongly accused, my pregnancy, etc).

For me it's how the club handled it. The whole team cancelled him on social media and United was quick to distance themselves from him.

"He wasn't helping the team but it's utterly stupid to pin our bad season on him. Even the opening game in which we beat Leeds there was something off about the team.

"It influences the player's willingness to move. The stupidly high wages and long contracts that Woodward used to give our squad players meant that no club that would buy them was going to maintain that high salary. So it became much more attractive for guys like Brandon Williams (¬£65k/week) or Bailly (¬£80k) to stay and sit on the bench. From the opposite side, most other clubs are less likely to buy these guys because those salaries would be at the limit of what they could afford and would ruin their wage structure, creating dissatisfaction among teammates who would be earning significantly less than e.g. Bailly.",Manchester United,Yes,javenji,t1_javd7fl

they are spending so much becos they can do it with the ffp loophole which uefa will limit to max 5 year amortization from now on. they spend 600m spread over 7 years is 85m amortization. they sold 60m worth of fringe players this season. so they actually spend 25m this season. and given that they are one of the best in selling players, and now with a bloated squad, it won't be a problem for them to sell 60m every season.",Manchester United,Yes,jaugghx,t1_jau4z9y

I don't mind keeping him around, but we really should be thinking about a replacement for him. If we stick with him for 2-3 seasons as a starter then we'll just be bottlenecking ourselves unless he becomes really good at passing (which won't happen). I'd preferably get his replacement as soon as possible. We can then give him cup matches.

I really don't give a fuck about what the public thinks about greenwood. what does his victim/fiance/wife/mother of his child think? I would be very slow to ignore her opinion or belittle it. Don't take away her agency. She is planning on living with this man for the rest of her life as things stand.

"You or I wouldn't settle, we wouldn't have the means.

Assumption then is why would someone settle for such large amounts of money if they are not guilty therefore settlement is admission of guilt.

However celebrities are very nearly always told to settle out of court. It means they can often get back to what they do to earn money, without an elongated court case and without anything case or not case related coming our and tarring the celebrity.

None of us KNOW that Ronaldo is guilty, sure you can point to the ""evidence"" in Der Spiegel, a publication that has been in trouble for faking stories in the past, and I would say that yes IF it comes from Ronaldo and is genuine, then it's pretty damning in itself, but there is no proof of it being the case.

Due to the high profile nature of celebrities and how just a mere accusation of something bad can be damaging to their career, they'll just settle things and pay money to try and avoid it hitting the media, regardless of if it's true or not because a lot of people will just hear the accusaiton, think they're guilty and then not pay any attention to how the case goes, and sometimes it'll come out they were innocent and did nothing wrong but the public doesn't notice and their career is still badly affected.

"It wasn't taken off her word you numpty

From documents that the Football Leaks whistleblowing platform has passed on to Der Spiegel, it appears that Mayorga's then lawyer contacted a Ronaldo lawyer in July 2009. In the months that followed, a whole team of lawyers dealt with the accusations. They raise a hundred questions for Ronaldo, his brother-in-law and his nephew.

In that document Ronaldo receives the alias' X. 'Kathryn Mayorga is' Ms. C '.

There are multiple versions of the questionnaire. The questions remain similar, but the answers are not. In a December 2009 version, Ronaldo talks about sex with mutual consent. He also says that he did not receive any signals that she did not agree with sex, or that she felt bad afterwards.

But there is another, older version of the questionnaire. De Standaard has also been able to view that document. That questionnaire was sent by mail in September 2009. The sender is a lawyer from the office of Carlos Os√≥rio de Castro, a confidant of Ronaldo. The recipients of the e-mail were Os√≥rio de Castro and another colleague.

'No, no, no'

On the question if Ms. C (Mayorga, ed.) Would have raised, shouted or called her voice, replied X (Ronaldo, ed.):

""She said no and stop several times."" She would have been lying on her side. ""I pushed her past behind. It was brutal. We have not changed the position. 5/7 minutes. She said she did not want it, but she kept herself available. ""And further:"" She has always said no. ""Do not do it. I'm not like the others. ""In retrospect, I apologized."" But she would not have shouted or called.

Question: Does Ms. C said something about it that the sex would have been too brutal for her? X: 'She did not complain about it being too brutal. She complained that I forced her. She did not say she would go to the police. ""

Ronaldo confirms in that version of the questionnaire that Mayorga has said no more than once. And he apologized to her afterwards. There are contradictions about whether Kathryn Mayorga would have satisfied him by hand. He says yes. She says not.

He also describes a foreplay in the bathroom. He also describes the previous acquaintance in the nightclub differently than she does: the women would have asked to be in the VIP section and have drunk a lot. Phone numbers would not have been exchanged. Ronaldo would have invited the women in the club to his hotel.

Most of the games he looks bad is when he plays with maguire. Both of them are solid when they are paired with varane/Lisandro. But I rate Lindel√∂f much higher than maguire. So hopefully he stays and we only have to replace maguire. Other than that our defensive depth is awesome.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqrnwc,t1_jaqhd82
"Ideally he stay, but won't blame him for leaving for game time.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqkwyu,t1_jaqhd82
I hope he does. Always liked him but I do think he‚Äôs too good to be a back up all the time. If he moved to Italy or Germany he‚Äôd start every game.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqjl6p,t1_jaqhd82
"Is it a tourist thing? Make it look like you had ""a proper English matchday"" on the lash, eating pies from a van and going home with you're programme. You can make it look like you were there at OT on insta!",Manchester United,Yes,jaqslvg,t1_jaqr8uq
Payback wages.,Manchester United,Yes,jaql9jb,t1_jaqkz5b
Whats it without the backpay though,Manchester United,Yes,jaqmsmh,t1_jaqkz5b
Surely we encounter the same issue this summer (if we pursue) that FDJ will still want Barca to cover his entitlement to deferred wages (less the balance he's got this year) and we will only want to pay him a fair wage (lets say 300k).,Manchester United,Yes,jaqsiu0,t1_jaqkz5b
Barca really fucked themselves,Manchester United,Yes,jat5gtw,t1_jaqkz5b
Indeed sad news for us when our best striker is out.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqrqr9,t1_jaqqz69
At least diaz isnt back yet though,Manchester United,Yes,jaqrowo,t1_jaqqz69
"\>Bruno not rested

&#x200B;

Andy Carroll will remain in the championship for what he did to Eriksen",Manchester United,Yes,jarlwv7,t1_jar3i42
Nobody talks about this. I wonder how much he might‚Äôve stagnated when the goalkeeper coaches kept changing. Especially after the former coach left in bad terms.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqxjcq,t1_jaq7fnv
"Went to a few matches with mates when he played in the championship for Huddersfield, looked a class above them. Composed on the ball, physical and not lacking in pace",Manchester United,Yes,jaqfze6,t1_jaqegrt
We would be very dumb not to if the price is half way reasonable. He‚Äôs solid af. I really like his game. Good addition for January window. Wout too for that matter.,Manchester United,Yes,jatpshr,t1_jas3hqc
"It‚Äôs certainly possible that we might try for Vlahovic given Juve‚Äôs financial situation. He seems more like a Chelsea type of striker though. Plus Italian league strikers almost never do well in the premier league. Vlahovic has shown nothing so far (including international tournaments) to suggest he‚Äôd light it up in this league. Just see what Scamacca has done at West Ham. 

We need a world class CF to compete against Man City and Haaland. After RVP left we‚Äôve literally been making do with injured or old ‚Äúpast their best‚Äù strikers like Falcao, Zlatan, Cavani and Ronaldo. The two best options by far would be Osimhen and Kane. I‚Äôd put Vlahovic a distant third best option.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqe6lg,t1_jaqdoxg
Romeo Lavia from Southampton too.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqjwg7,t1_jaqdoxg
Kim isn't going to move to be a 3rd choice,Manchester United,Yes,jaqmxr8,t1_jaqdoxg
Cavani,Manchester United,Yes,jaqk1aj,t1_jaqjfhn
"Do you mean first signature celebration in our squad‚Äôs history or just the current squad? If it‚Äôs the former, all of Rooney, Nani, Lingard, Pogba and co had a couple, albeit they cycled through them quite often.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqjli4,t1_jaqjfhn
Loads of players do it though don‚Äôt they?,Manchester United,Yes,jaqjyw4,t1_jaqjfhn
"I think you can definitely count Ronaldo because he created a new celebration, the one where he is pretending to sleep after he slept in the bus or something. He didn't score many goals this season so we didn't see it much, but he was definitely trying to make it a thing.",Manchester United,Yes,jar95oo,t1_jaqjfhn
Lee Sharpe.,Manchester United,Yes,jarbv0w,t1_jaqjfhn
"The good news is this is for 5 games so it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôll get at least one of them. Also the Fulham game is on ballot so the queue doesn‚Äôt matter. This is nothing like being behind 70,000 people for that Barcelona game",Manchester United,Yes,jaqk3g3,t1_jaqjms9
"Yep, I feel you. No idea if there‚Äôll be any seats left over by the time we get in.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqjtl8,t1_jaqjms9
The other one is as well. Steve Round was Moyes' assistant,Manchester United,Yes,jar2pr7,t1_jaqxsi0
I didn't realize pelligrini is the manager of Betis. Will be weird to see him again,Manchester United,Yes,jarwh5o,t1_jaqxsi0
his peak squad won 1 covid premier league title and was hyped as best squad of all time lmao,Manchester United,Yes,jaru6xq,t1_jarliet
Seems a bit of a weird claim. I think this team has a good mix of youth and experience especially if we focus on some younger midfielders.,Manchester United,Yes,jarv4bh,t1_jarliet
The 20 years was just a bit of hyperbole but his point was a stupid one anyway.,Manchester United,Yes,jasa5gp,t1_jarliet
Not built for twenty ? Watch Casemiro stay World Class into his early 50s.,Manchester United,Yes,jatrqso,t1_jarliet
Every PL club would have the same idea. Fees will be anything but modest,Manchester United,Yes,jaqvh2d,t1_jaqr2ip
Why you think we can get a hot prospect midfielder in EPL with a modest fee?,Manchester United,Yes,jaqw921,t1_jaqr2ip
"Stop paying off refs. 
Start pulling levers. 
This is the way.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqmt98,t1_jaqevpa
What news?,Manchester United,Yes,jaqg00s,t1_jaqevpa
Because they need the money?,Manchester United,Yes,jaqf8ds,t1_jaqevpa
Pay no mind as long as we win the 3 points in the end.,Manchester United,Yes,jaq15py,t1_japv1o0
Feeling good now. Probably will be hungover come Sunday because I have no self control.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqbqse,t1_jaqa8iq
I'd say a narrow win. Possibly 2-1 but that's to keep the nerves calmed. Considering how they are playing and how we are i hope a demolition.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqf7jj,t1_jaqa8iq
I wonder if stretford end will cheer or remain silent if he scores,Manchester United,Yes,jarlrup,t1_jar4ym1
"We struggled there in our best of years.

Anfield is a fortress. If not for Real Madrid, it is for us.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqcxty,t1_jaqbs61
"I was a lot more confident a couple of weeks ago. Since then, the Scousers have improved enough to see a win over United kick-starting their charge into the top four.

On the other hand, beating them will hurt them even more.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqk5ng,t1_jaqbs61
"A bit yeah. I just hope even if we lose, it's gonna be close game like Arsenal away, but just don't let me see Nunez score a late winner, my heart can't take it",Manchester United,Yes,jaql7fh,t1_jaqbs61
"Maybe Scott.

Don't think Fred will leave.

Relatively low wages and we won't get much if we sold him anyway.",Manchester United,Yes,jas3o5o,t1_jas0hg7
McTominay is a must sell imo. Fred should stay. Hopefully we sign a top centre mid then Fred can exclusively be used as a second half sub which is when he's at his best,Manchester United,Yes,jat1yf2,t1_jas0hg7
I highly doubt we were looking within England for depth. It'll probably be someone from the Netherlands,Manchester United,Yes,jaszk9b,t1_jaskbcb
"The extension is just to make sure that if he does go, it's for silly money. Wouldn't be surprised if there were release clauses included.",Manchester United,Yes,jatrac5,t1_jaskbcb
"Absolutely blows my mind that not only were the Glazers able to buy United by putting the debt on us, but then they don't even have to pay the debt off. Just looks like one massive scam. 

They truly are parasites. They've done nothing but drained it and allowed it to decay.",Manchester United,Yes,jarbace,t1_jaqm0iw
"The number one priority for any new owner should be clearing the debt so the club can be self sufficient. If Ratcliffe won't do that, what's the point of him even getting involved?",Manchester United,Yes,jaqp4i6,t1_jaqm0iw
Youve totally missed the point of why people don‚Äôt want the Qatari‚Äôs.,Manchester United,Yes,jarbneo,t1_jaqm0iw
"Not sure why anyone takes any of this as gospel, we've seen media get it wrong or misrepresent stuff and owners lie plenty of times. We're in the middle of negotiations, we've already seen the Glazers take sudden interest in staying when the bids were a bit lower than they wanted. Not saying it's not true but this is that weird middle space where we know some names, we know the intention, but really, we know fuck all else. Which i accept is a frustrating spot to be in.",Manchester United,Yes,jar0jy1,t1_jaqm0iw
I would keep the debt if clearing it comes at the cost of selling the club to the Qatari bigots,Manchester United,Yes,jaqs9f9,t1_jaqm0iw
Supporting Qatar takeover =/= supporting Greenwood. Ffs some people just have cabbage for brains,Manchester United,Yes,jaqo5ow,t1_jaqkkpm
"I think that‚Äôs harsh. Most people expected Greenwood to be prosecuted at the very least, the charges being dropped and the victim still being with him and soon having his kid will have softened stances for sure. 

And yes I know all about people going back to their abusers and what not, but I‚Äôll be honest this woman lives in the UK not some oppressive third world country, she could have moved on from him and that life and chose not to. 

If she won‚Äôt even move ahead with helping the police and wants to be with the guy then whatever, good luck to her is all I can say. Not sure what people expect from the courts or even United at that point.

Maybe they should just sell him? I‚Äôd be for that frankly. But if he‚Äôs brought back, meh, I won‚Äôt be pleased but I won‚Äôt blame the club either. Ronaldo‚Äôs victim maintained her accusations and everyone on this sub (barring a few) probably cheered all his goals. So let‚Äôs not pretend we have any moral high ground to begin with.",Manchester United,Yes,jarci2g,t1_jaqkkpm
Spot on,Manchester United,Yes,jaqmp35,t1_jaqkkpm
Email that to the manager. Pretty sure he have the final say.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqo2ug,t1_jaqkkpm
"Nah. He's not dynamic enough for Ten Hag's system. For the price being quoted for him, we can get two players who'd be a better fit.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqjeby,t1_jaqiohe
"Nope. I wouldn't want us playing Casemiro and Rice together, and Rice isn't going to come here and play backup to Case. Even if he was, we have more important positions to fill with the (minimum) ¬£70m that Rice would cost.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqlth7,t1_jaqiohe
"Only if they go down, imo. He‚Äôs not worth (nor do we have) ¬£100 that West Ham will want. But he is a solid player. Definitely in the category of player that would step up his game with better players around him.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqjiuq,t1_jaqiohe
we can‚Äôt spend like that though. FFP rules,Manchester United,Yes,jatiotn,t1_jat58aa
"Ronaldo didn‚Äôt play for two and a half years due to injury and came back to dominate the world cup
and win it with brazil",Manchester United,Yes,jaqev4r,t1_jaqeg7h
Luke Shaw. Out 1 year double broken leg.,Manchester United,Yes,jaql38z,t1_jaqeg7h
"Who knows? He was stagnating a little before all this, but that could have been due to poor coaching and the general atmosphere at the club.

Players come back from long injuries and are just as effective, and I'm sure Greenwood has been keeping himself in shape. If he does return, success would depend on him being receptive to coaching and prepared to work his arse off.

My gut tells me that he'd underwhelm and fade away, under the amount of scrutiny.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqjs40,t1_jaqeg7h
"yeah i think its quite common for players to miss a year or 18 months from big injuries. in his case, the bigger question is not match fitness or physical ability, 

its mental. Whether he's able to play in front of 30-60k fans chanting rapist every game. most ppl will get depressed after a month or so if they are so hated.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqgn0p,t1_jaqeg7h
"Probably means his ceiling has significantly dropped. 

Anyway he can fuck off to Turkey or Saudia & go about restoring his career there.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqf114,t1_jaqeg7h
Players get injured for long times and come back to peak fitness. Let's be honest it's not like he's been sitting on the couch for a year. He would have been training with personal trainers.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqeuho,t1_jaqeg7h
"Like how senior RM players protested against Ronaldo and Benzema playing? Or like how senior Arsenal players stopped Thomas Partey?

Let's not overestimate the moral compass of football players",Manchester United,Yes,jatxtrv,t1_jasxoq4
I'm curious as to what the hell the new evidence uncovered was. Feel like that needs to be revealed to get the full story on why this is even being considered,Manchester United,Yes,jat1sib,t1_jasxoq4
Doubt he ever will because can you imagine the boos he‚Äôll get on and off the pitch,Manchester United,Yes,jatmbux,t1_jasxoq4
What did he say?,Manchester United,Yes,jastkbn,t1_jash7v6
I'd say fan and home. Player feels better to wear but it's less durable generally.,Manchester United,Yes,jat2ftd,t1_jasx5da
"rice is good player but way too overrated from what he actually is, plus west ham actually have overpriced him like crazy.",Manchester United,Yes,jarcw6y,t1_jar5xvb
good player but he's overpriced and overhyped. Rather go to south america and get a 20yo we can grow to become casemiro's successor,Manchester United,Yes,jargjq7,t1_jar5xvb
"I feel like it would be too defensive. Rice isn't a great passer and while he is capable of carrying the ball via dribbling, I feel like he doesn't do much with it afterwards.

We need someone more technical. Ideally speaking, Eriksen with more athleticism. De Jong really is the best fit.",Manchester United,Yes,jar8op6,t1_jar5xvb
50/60 mill max. west ham are insane if they think anyone not called chelsea is meeting their 150 mill price tag,Manchester United,Yes,jarlmwb,t1_jar5xvb
He‚Äôs really not that good imo,Manchester United,Yes,jat4r9y,t1_jar5xvb
We need someone who's the best of both worlds between Eriksen and Fred. Someone who's good creatively but can also defend. Rice doesn't satisfy that Imo.,Manchester United,Yes,jat01sc,t1_jar5xvb
Guess what they HAD in common?,Manchester United,Yes,jaquhg0,t1_jaqqw2t
"i still prefer sabitzer and casemiro but fred's in decent form so could be either.

i'd personally start sabitzer and casemiro so that we can be better on the ball and progression/buildup.

real q is whether rashford starts on the left or through the middle. do we want him up against the most overrated rb in pl history or embarrass van dickhead?",Manchester United,Yes,jaq5u4e,t1_jaq0xca
"If we have a lot of the ball then sub, if we are defending and playing on the counter, starter",Manchester United,Yes,jaq2byb,t1_jaq0xca
Sub... Fred is always better as a sub. He's been in good form along side Case. But that's about the only player he pairs well with lol. He and Sabi did not perform well together,Manchester United,Yes,jaq6npc,t1_jaq0xca
The fact that Casemiro considers him as one of the best talents in the squad tells you he can start. Also depends on the opposition. Look how he thwarted KDB in the derby. He's able to do both roles.,Manchester United,Yes,jaq7b7w,t1_jaq0xca
As a starter. He‚Äôs our best CM until Eriksen is back.,Manchester United,Yes,jaq2ark,t1_jaq0xca
"To be honest, depends on the match. I'd start him in a high intensity game such as liverpool but will bring him on around 70 mins otherwise.",Manchester United,Yes,jaq2a9w,t1_jaq0xca
Starter. He have chemistry with Casemiro. Then 70th can bring in Sabitzer or McT for added pressure or defend if we have the lead.,Manchester United,Yes,jaq16tj,t1_jaq0xca
It's the flair. On the website it's on the right side of the page where you can edit the flair.,Manchester United,Yes,jaq0mkf,t1_japyl0r
yeah i‚Äôd like to know too,Manchester United,Yes,jaq0abn,t1_japyl0r
Mata played well for us when called upon in the latter stages of his contract. And it's a shame no manager wanted to play him where he thrived for Chelsea.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqeak5,t1_jaqc09w
"Like what do you want to achieve with this? I'm not with it? 

Mata had more than 3 good years and yeah his contract got extended but he's moved on, thebclub have moved on and it's in the past. You're looking for random things to shout at",Manchester United,Yes,jaqc492,t1_jaqc09w
His main job scope is Youth mentor.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqlh8f,t1_jaqc09w
"He's a nice guy with a pretty face, don't expect him to be talked about like Jones the meme guy",Manchester United,Yes,jaqczl8,t1_jaqc09w
"Your life must be fucking exciting if this is what you do with it. Footys about moments not numbers on a screen, try to at least enjoy it",Manchester United,Yes,jaq1ln7,t1_japuij5
Fuck off.,Manchester United,Yes,japxcnt,t1_japuij5
"That sounds right.

My experience is you wait a while in the queue, then you look at a few matches and realise there is only hospitality tickets left.  
You keep looking and then get randomly kicked out back to the queue. When you get back in you finish checking the other matches and if you are lucky you might find some suitable tickets.

There is often quite a few singles dotted about, but buying multiple seats (close) together is harder.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqdlh0,t1_japxpgr
"If he/his people are feeding the press, it's all the more reason to not let him back imo.",Manchester United,No,jat4fyk,t1_jat37hx
I don‚Äôt think Mount is that special tbh. You could find plenty of young players in Europe that can do exactly what he does.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqadxj,t1_jaq2roz
"I mean, I get it. Yeah, it‚Äôs a little dry sometimes on this sub, but the alternative is having a bunch of low effort memes to sort through and people who think their shit reactionary opinions deserve their own post.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqaacp,t1_jaq5n7q
I agree. It's because we're playing every 3 days is why our momentum is rocking.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqfhli,t1_jaqbww5
">I don‚Äôt think I got that since Sir Alex‚Äôs time

We had multiple comebacks during Ole's tenure.",Manchester United,Yes,japm5g9,t1_japl447
A bunch of bouncing busby babes,Manchester United,Yes,japmu5k,t1_japm4zk
Odegaard would have been sent back to Norway crying.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqfj8s,t1_jaqaffv
We need a starting midfielder to play alongside Casemiro too. There is clearly a FdJ-shaped hole in our midfield.,Manchester United,Yes,jaq9x80,t1_jaq704f
"We have others pulling their own weight too, fred martial anthony at 6 goals, case and sancho at 5, few people at 4. There is huge improvement from our midfielders and our wingers. Football is a team game.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqf0sc,t1_jaq9kym
Just wondering what his path to first team would be if we buy a striker this summer. Rashford/garnacho on left and antony/Amad on the right is kinda what I was thinking.,Manchester United,Yes,japsp0q,t1_japrtd2
"The only problem is there really aren't many midfielders of De Jong's profile. He is a midfielder that progresses the ball via dribbling and breaks the press the same way. Frankly, I can't think of many similar players, maybe Kovacic?",Manchester United,Yes,jar9s7j,t1_jaqfg7n
"Straight swap for McSauce, easy done.

If McTominay was called Maco and came from La Masia he would be worth 200m",Manchester United,Yes,jaqd8r4,t1_jaqcw10

"Eric Ramsey hasn‚Äôt left, he has joined Wales national team coaching staff in addition to his duties at Man Utd‚Ä¶",Manchester United,Yes,jaq76ir,t1_jaq6ma3
"He‚Äôs not leaving, he‚Äôs doing club and national duty at the same time.",Manchester United,Yes,jaq76t1,t1_jaq6ma3
I don't think he left.,Manchester United,Yes,jaq71ur,t1_jaq6ma3
Probably a little unfair to just call him the set piece coach (I know that‚Äôs not your intention) since I believe he does a lot more than that nowadays.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqa1ad,t1_jaq6ma3
Is he really overpriced though? 120-150m for a centre mid that could potentially be a starter for us for 10-15 years is worth it in today's market. A player of his ability at that age is incredibly rare to see,Manchester United,Yes,jat5w2w,t1_jaqan81
He‚Äôs expensive but not overpriced considering he‚Äôs one of the best young midfielders in the world,Manchester United,Yes,jax985t,t1_jaqan81
"Bellingham has proven it for far longer than both Enzo and Felix, possibly even combined. Lukaku was just bad business but under Conte he was world class",Manchester United,Yes,jat644t,t1_jaqbmmf
"We really need to go and sign a top third centre back soon. Someone like Timber. Look at City - they have Dias, Stones, Laporte, Akanji and Ake. Our drop off after Varane and Martinez is massive",Manchester United,Yes,jat6pns,t1_jaqrnwc
"| Too good to be a back-up | 

That's what we need if we want to challenge for all trophies . We need players who will not let us feel the absence of 1st team players if they get injured.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqmvzp,t1_jaqjl6p
Think 14m base. Owed like 17m. And they pay him very high bonuses and loyalties every year.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqr6r6,t1_jaqmsmh
Agreed but your points contradict your two ‚Äúbest‚Äù options IMO. Osimhen plays in Italy and Kane is somewhat past his prime (yes he can do a job into his 30s but that not his prime..),Manchester United,Yes,jaqqv2o,t1_jaqe6lg
"Yeah, Nani‚Äôs flip is the only one I‚Äôd count there as signature. The rest, as you say, we‚Äôre cycled through often or even just one offs.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqjsk1,t1_jaqjli4
No very true I just gave up straight away for Barca,Manchester United,Yes,jaqkjxh,t1_jaqk3g3
Do you pay for ballot before even being selected? As it‚Äôs asking for a payment,Manchester United,Yes,jaqqos6,t1_jaqk3g3

"U tell me lol, old man is probably lonely and wants attention",Manchester United,Yes,jaqqhjs,t1_jaqp4i6
Be the token 'I tried' investor just like he did at Chelsea,Manchester United,Yes,jaqqikk,t1_jaqp4i6
"Jassim can probably clear it immediately, Jim can't. 

I'll ignore Jim over Qatar because that has been gone over enough time. 

The plus side to Jim over Glazer is theoretically decisions being made with the sporting side being the priority rather than the business side. Jim and INEOS will get money out of it of course but he wants to come in and get us competing again. 

With better people in charge of the sporting decisions over the last 10 years things would have been a lot different and the only issue really would be the stadium. 

There are ways to look after the debt that don't involve a Sheikh wiping it out in one go. It'll just take time.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqvl0p,t1_jaqp4i6
There is an incredible crossover with immense selfishness as the common factor. Both camps view football as more important than women‚Äôs rights.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqpvw2,t1_jaqo5ow
"Both show a lack of spine and morals ,If you can be fine with murderers and bigots owning the club then there is nothing stopping you from wanting a rapist at the club",Manchester United,Yes,jaqsehb,t1_jaqo5ow
"It's not a big jump in logic. Main argument against a Qatar bid is on morals. If we decide football has no morality, or at least that we shouldn't bring them into football decisions then Greenwood surely comes back in. He's got the ability, plays in a spot we need and is legally innocent. The reason people want him out is a moral question. 

The commenter did say ""some people"" and described the attitude of those people, they didn't say ""all people"". If there's a take where you want Qatar ownership because you are win at all costs but don't want Greenwood back it'd be good to hear rather than just calling people stupid.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqw3s2,t1_jaqo5ow
"Had the same thought but then the question is, which two good midfielders are available or will be willing to come to Utd. Considering the best position for Sabitzer, VDB is the one that we have seen Fred playing at with forward runs, and we need a proper CM/CDM role, what are our options?",Manchester United,Yes,jaqrvjr,t1_jaqjeby
Ffp isn't a real thing at this point. It's never enforced properly and as Boehly demonstrated there's ways to exploit it. Also I'd bet on us making like 50-70 odd million in sales,Manchester United,Yes,jatks8l,t1_jatiotn
"Still, Ronaldo was the best player in the world when he got injured, Greenwood wasn't even the best player in our squad. I would think a young player with potential would need constant coaching and direction, so unless he met up with Steve McClaren under a shady bridge every week, I'm still a bit in doubt",Manchester United,Yes,jaqf4uk,t1_jaqev4r
"A few goals, some melodramatic interviews from him and his girlfriend, and some PR drivel will reduce some of the hostility from home fans.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqisfs,t1_jaqgn0p

"something about how our current team won't last 20 years. Not even an exaggeration, he literally said 20 (twenty) years. I know what he meant, but he's still so wrong.

Rice is overrated by this sub,Manchester United,Yes,jar9tyr,t1_jar8op6

I think Sabitzer is flippin quality and being an ex captain of Leipzig he be another leader in the dressing room!

He can fill in at several positions and offers a different type of ability to our other players on the wings. If he is in good form he will get plenty of chances to start. If he meets his potential he has the chance to become first choice on the right even depending on Antony/Amads/others growth.,Manchester United,Yes,jarxjk6,t1_japsp0q

"It's a huge jump in logic.

The issues with the qataris are what they get up to in their own country, completely out of the control of the UK and our way of life here and the atrocities committed will be done by their people, not by Manchester United employees. In addition due to the Qatari involvement coming down to the glazers greed, we have practically zero power to stop them getting involved.

Greenwood on the other hand has committed an atrocity in the UK, whilst being a Manchester United employee and the fans have a hell of a lot of power to oppose his return. As shipping out one player is an easily achievable task to put out the fire of fan outrage.",Manchester United,Yes,jar6y3b,t1_jaqw3s2
"I'd rather have Mac Allister than Rice, and think he'd be a good 8 alongside Casemiro.

Greenwood had a higher ceiling than rashford and was one of our best performers. players have missed far more time through injury and came back. it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs just been eating maccies everyday. He‚Äôs probably been training every other day with personal trainers.,Manchester United,Yes,jaqfdmd,t1_jaqf4uk
"He has the money to pay for private coaching. Whether he did, we have no idea. He might just have been sitting in his house playing videogames, in between gym sessions, for the last year.

His finishing ability was remarkable, and players usually don't lose that, but Ten Hag demands a lot more from his strikers than the ability to put the ball in the net. 

Regardless, I think the decision here will come down to two things - will the club believe that Greenwood can convincingly show he's changed, and will the rest of the squad accept him back? He reportedly had few friends in the dressing room before this all broke.

I wish that I could say the opinions of the United Women's team would be taken into account too, but they likely won't be.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqq1fs,t1_jaqf4uk

"You a bit annoyed you have nothing to complain about these days now we are doing well? 

I'd have let Mata go aswell, but a mercenary? He put in some decent years at the club when there wasn't much to cheer about, and was well thought of around the place as a good figure in the dressing room. 

Even your entire point is based on some apparent anger at Jones and while it is an annoying case most fans have made peace with the Jones thing on compassionate grounds. Same with someone like Matic, he was past it but at least a leader in the dressing room.

Lingard 150k a week, the same as Mata after one good season, Pogba on 300k to play basketball in LA and flirt with other clubs, Dean Henderson on 150k and has more videos slagging off the club than starts, De Gea as much as I love him is not deserving to be made the highest earning keeper in history, Lukaku was on 200-250 and threw a strop because he wasn't guaranteed games, Alexis Sanchez was 300-450k with bonuses and never did a thing for us, Martial has had some excellent seasons but has barely played over the last few years for 250k a week. Never mind the likes of Falcao, Di Maria, Schewinsteiger who were all on an absolute bomb and barely contributed and two barely lasted. 

Long story short yeah our wage structure was mental over the last decade, this is not new. Despite the weird ""hey everyone angry at this guy should be angry at this guy too"" post you're throwing out this morning, there is a long list of people who top Mata in regard to being a mercenary

But i agree it wasn‚Äôt sustainable in the long run, and the team just collapsed last season.",Manchester United,Yes,jappl8a,t1_japm9yj
"Completely agree on Sabitzer, he's the real deal and I hope we lock him up. I hope that the FdJ saga from last summer was more about him wanting what he was owed by Barca, because if he's not committed, then I hope we don't go after him again.",Manchester United,Yes,jaqkupl,t1_jaqfl34
"Ideally, we buy Sabitzer and sell McTominay. Potentially making ¬£10-15m on that deal. I think Sabitzer just needs a couple of goals and assists to seal the deal.

If we can get De Jong as well, that's an extremely solid midfield core - Case, Fred, Sabitzer, FDJ and Eriksen. Mainoo will keep developing as well.

"Sabitzer has shown he can play there if needed. Not really something that would fix a possible long term injury of Casemiro, but as a backup he looked competent enough.

"Exactly that. Eriksen is good for the first 60 mins but thats it. If West Ham do go down, Rice might just be the guy we need for 50m maybe? He'd want to leave and is definitely coachable",Manchester United,Yes,jar9t79,t1_jar9cum
"But he won't come to play as a backup and Rice-Casemiro is far too defensive of a midfield. It's like two DMs next to each other. Would it work?

Agreed. Someone in FDJ's mould. Does our academy have any prospects in a natural cdm role. We tried McTominay but it isnt his natural position,Manchester United,Yes,jara9s7,t1_jara36w
"Yeah, De Jong would be the perfect partner for Casemiro. Just a shame it's so unlikely.

Our academy does possibly have players who are similar to FDJ, I think both Iqbal and Mainoo are good at dribbling and skipping past players in the midfield. They still need a lot of time to develop though.

As for pure DMs, we don't really have any. We should by a cheap young French DM to be backup for Casemiro if Sabitzer isn't enough.",Manchester United,Yes,jaraitc,t1_jara9s7

"One thing that really surprised me was how Garnacho just kept going yesterday. I thought he‚Äôd tire, but he looked just as fresh at the end of the game.

"This season really proves that so much of the shit players got in the previous seasons wasn‚Äôt ever their fault. Granted, call them out for jogging or having bad attitudes or any of that jazz.  But so much wasn‚Äôt on them.

McTominay was seen as ‚Äúthat academy player who sucks and should be sold ASAP. He‚Äôs trash. Just here for his academy status and doesn‚Äôt belong‚Äù. a lot of that is true in that he‚Äôs not a starter caliber of player. But now that he‚Äôs in a suitable role? We laugh at him being a target man. He sometimes plays as the 4th choice CM. It‚Äôs all good.

Fred was ‚Äúinconsistent. Bad. Can‚Äôt pass. Can‚Äôt score. Sell him. ‚Äú and again. He has weaknesses. But now that he has a system that works (next to Casemiro who plays a good pivot + being a second choice)? Now he‚Äôs the workhorse who never gets tired. The guy who always smiles and is loved by his fellow teammates

Shaw went from being inconsistent to consistently being brilliant. And a lot of that was never his fault (probably). You need a coach who gives you a clear role and also defines your role based on the game and how you match up against the opposition. Now he also looks good at CB goddamn it. 

It‚Äôs similar shit for Marcus. Much of what he got hate for last season was ‚Äúbeing predictable and a ball hog‚Äù. And it‚Äôs obviously a flaw in how he played. But any one who knows ball knows how good he is when he keeps it simple and runs on the last man. That‚Äôs what he did best even when he came in. Now give him a coach with a system that doesn‚Äôt allow him to try 20 step overs but instead puts him in the right spot? Brilliant.

Sancho got some personal time off and came back looking strong.

Martial looks good when fit and I‚Äôve never heard anyone call him lazy off late.

AWB is looking good again. Dalot is turning into what we were promised when he joined.

DDG looks good again.

Bruno is back on top.

"Does anyone think Sancho might be a sneaky candidate to be sold this summer? 

Rashford and sometimes Garnacho are better on the LW (or at least both are direct and fast enough to trouble defenders 1v1 or on the break in a way Sancho can't). 

Antony is first choice at RW and while I'm sure Sancho would perform similarly or better in the Championship, Amad has had a promising loan and could come in for the backup RW. 

People say Sancho can transition to the 10 role, but he's doesn't have anywhere near the engine Bruno has and I hope we sign another CM such that Eriksen can be the deputy 10. 

I'm not saying we should sell him and obviously there's a ton of untapped potential, but if we needed to raise funds and you were to pick someone who was both surplus to needs AND able to fetch a decent fee, he sort of fits the bill.",Manchester United,No,janl76o,t3_11fs9be

Maguire seems to hate the idea of passing first time, so the person he passes to gets the ball under pressure and has to go backwards right away. Also doesn‚Äôt help that Scott hides and doesn‚Äôt ask for the ball from his cbs. And when he does get it, scott‚Äôs first instinct is to run with the ball rather than pass, again letting the defense adjust. I lost count of how many times I was screaming at the screen in the first half for one of them to pass the ball instead of walking it over to the recipient 

IMO that‚Äôs what casemiro changed the most: called for the ball from the cbs and moved it quickly, allowing us to bypass pressure and overload one side

We can't keep playing poorly and going behind like that, because the subs won't always rescue us or we won't be so lucky in from on goal, look at the goals we scored...own goal, individual brilliance from a fortunate rebound and then just a late Fred consolation that the defender was at fault for, similarly against Newcastle, yes we fought and defended well but before a set-piece and deflected goal we were poor, although Barca didn't create a lot we were still poor and didn't take control of the game until they scored then although we played better we relied on a shinner from Fred and a great goal from Antony that fell to him kindly, you can also touch on the Leicester and Leeds game for signs of serious problems starting and controlling matches.

Yes the fight, grit, determination that haven't been their before have allowed to get back in the above situations so the improvement is clear, but we need to be in control from minute one and we need to be creating chances and finishing them, not relying on deflections, mistakes and low chance long rangers.

I have a strong fear we'll lose to Liverpool on Sunday, we all know they're better on paper than they're showing and they'll be motivated against us, plus it's at their place, throw in our recent performances and the fact their players won't struggle to finish against us and our luck could potentially run out.",Manchester United,No,jam42qn,t3_11fs9be
"I am sick of this sub-obsession with Kane trying to shove down our throats. He is a 30-year man who loves his club and is their highest goal scorer.

He is not sort of guy who will hand transfer requests like some people are claiming or is eager to join us.

Likewise, he isn't some sort of messiah. He is a striker who will soon pass his peak and why should we blow half our transfer budget on this guy? Knowing how bitter of a man Levy is he would rather let him go for free than sent him to their rival or ask 120 m for him.

This transfer makes absolutely no sense apart from pleasing some of the people who have this weird obsession with seeing Kane in United shirt. Kinda similar to Ronnie return but that actually made sense because he was already someone whom we had fond memories with \].

"Can I be honest? I‚Äôm really just not on board with all the Weghorst gushing/admiration. At least to the degree/lengths that some people are going in regard to wanting us to sign him permanently.

I fully recognize and appreciate that he puts in a shift and hustles his ass off, but he really does miss a ton of golden opportunities and we have been so lucky to not have been burned by them. 

Randomly, I am a bit of a Wolfsburg fan. I remember when he played for them, and his chance wasting was very similar. He‚Äôd get 4/5 great chances a game, chances that if martial had missed for us people would be calling for his head on a platter. Wout would score one of those chances and it would really hide the fact that he missed so many. 

I think ETH and the coaching staff have worked a minor miracle finding a way that we could use/utilize Weghorst. Lets not act that this drop deep false 10 type role is what he was asked to do from game one. We initially tried to have him be a traditional bit 9 target man, and it pretty much flopped. 

If you guys feel we need a hard working, run their legs into the ground for the cause/tactical press type striker, you really don‚Äôt need to look any further than Victor Osimhen. He literally presses and works just as hard as Wout, but has the pace of Rashford. Oh and he is a fantastic finisher. If you have a chance, go watch his performance from last weeks game against Empoli. Specifically around the 67 min mark after Napoli got a red card. The effort and press led by him despite his team being down a man is phenomenal. 

I‚Äôm not trying to say Wout isn‚Äôt a likable player who truly gives his all for the cause of the team. I appreciate the shifts that he is putting in, but I‚Äôd be lying if I didn‚Äôt say I wish we had a healthy Maritial in the team right now and  the calls for Weghorst to be signed on a permanent deal are just way over the top.",Manchester United,No,jalb80g,t3_11fs9be

Home (no order): Fulham, Brentford, Wolves, Chelsea, Villa, Everton, Southampton.

Home wins: 5
Home draws: 2

Away (no order): Liverpool, Brighton, Newcastle, Spurs, West Ham, Forest, Bournemouth.

Away wins: 4
Away loss: 1
Away draws: 2

This would take us to 49 pts + 15 pts (5 home wins) + 2 pts (2 home draws) + 12 pts (4 away wins) + 2 pts (2 away draws) = 81 pts. 

I hope your version comes true.",Manchester United,Yes,jamwabh,t1_jalvzv7
Then we‚Äôll have no RB.,Manchester United,Yes,jalya9j,t1_jalx5kv
Instructions unclear; now you have a RB with Dalot's defending and AWB's attacking skills.,Manchester United,Yes,jam0yqt,t1_jalx5kv
And 10x the desire,Manchester United,Yes,jal7a14,t1_jal6wzm
He's a psycho. He has to play every minute of every game.,Manchester United,Yes,jalkbjp,t1_jaljv8g
They always turn up when it‚Äôs against us,Manchester United,Yes,jam2a8l,t1_jam14kh
"Potter gives me Moyes vibes.

For one reason or another, and some might be out of his control, he looks out of his depth.

Ten Hag is the textbook definition for control at a big club.",Manchester United,Yes,jamf4g3,t1_jamcauq
"""We have fewer wins in 16 than Gary Neville did during his time managing Valencia""

They made Gary proud üòÇ",Manchester United,Yes,jamvobv,t1_jamcauq
"That Matisse dude man, he's creaming for ETH at every opportunity.",Manchester United,Yes,jamgxz0,t1_jamcauq
Lol! So true going through their daily discussion. Spurs are not far behind them.,Manchester United,Yes,jamfxr8,t1_jamcauq
"The last time we won at Anfield was Juanfield under LVG. It‚Äôs been about 8 years, fuck sake lol",Manchester United,Yes,jalus0g,t1_jaltz1j
Disgusting to think about,Manchester United,Yes,jan6aqm,t1_jan3caj
"Wait, if they were not even in the same league then what's the issue?",Manchester United,Yes,jalw2k3,t1_jalvvo5
Probably more because their midfield is non-existent.  If they played their usual high pressing style against us then it would end exactly as the Madrid game did for them.,Manchester United,Yes,jalz854,t1_jalyyl5
Are they going to counter attack?,Manchester United,Yes,jalz1ji,t1_jalyyl5
Liverpool vs United games are a completely different animal. We used to get beat by shite Liverpool teams all the time.,Manchester United,Yes,jan7iki,t1_jamkk3e
It would be good for us if they lose to us but somehow can pull good results against the other 3 rivals though.,Manchester United,Yes,jamu4vn,t1_jamkk3e
There's still plenty of dead weight in this team that needs to be sold,Manchester United,Yes,jalmbt0,t1_jalewg6
Horrible? One is winning the league and other one are defending champions of UCL.,Manchester United,Yes,jalwv8u,t1_jalwo9e
"Don't see it happening, Barca look to be in for another summer of ""modest"" spending due to their feud with La Liga and Kvaratskhelia (a Madrid fan who is happy in Napoli) will probably only leave for an astronomical fee.",Manchester United,Yes,jaly9ig,t1_jalwo9e
"They can make as much money, have a higher chance of domestic success due to being less competitive but also have a good run in Europe

Weather and lifestyle play a big part. It's just a nice place to be",Manchester United,Yes,jam04hl,t1_jalwo9e
Prestige! We have similar pull power.,Manchester United,Yes,jalz8dt,t1_jalwo9e
"Love seeing the plaudits Wout is getting. He‚Äôs doing the dirty work extremely well, deserves some shine!",Manchester United,Yes,jamyc5l,t1_jamr1u3
"It helps that Weghorst‚Äôs pressing is smart too, not just aimless running. He always approaches the opposition player at an angle so he narrows down their options significantly.

I remember last season pressing with some players sprinting head on towards an opposition defender only for them to kick the ball slightly left or right to a teammate. It looked so amateur",Manchester United,Yes,jan3nh3,t1_jamr1u3
Weird flashback to him playing CB for us in Australia less than 8 months ago,Manchester United,Yes,jaouk6r,t1_jansmcx
I can't see a path back for him. Shaw has that position locked down and Malacia is more than capable. Though who knows how he would improve under ETH and with half a dozen Portuguese speakers.,Manchester United,Yes,janze0h,t1_jansmcx
"seems like he has been in and out of Seville team so far, 8 starts plus 7 sub appearances in la liga so I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs a likely permanent destination for him as they won‚Äôt commit to his wages if he isn‚Äôt a 1st team regular (he is on about 90k pw here I believe which for Seville is big money)

Have a feeling he will either be moved on in the summer for a nominal fee (5 mill or so) or will spend final year of his contract out on loan again

Would be quite surprised if he ever plays for us again given how well shaw has done this year and the potential of malacia",Manchester United,Yes,janz04e,t1_jansmcx
"Honestly I believe everyone has accepted that Kane understands the gravity of the situation for a couple of years now, but it's only him & his emo connect with the club that's stopping from some success. And by success I mean winning some silverware & not being mocked for being a Spurs player",Manchester United,Yes,jal7119,t1_jal31st
he would slot so fuckin good into that spot with us,Manchester United,Yes,jaliydq,t1_jal31st
"""ramadel falcaoooooooooo"" pops into my head at least twice a week.",Manchester United,Yes,jalh9xs,t1_jalagd0
Oh Owen Hargreaves!,Manchester United,Yes,jalwqze,t1_jalagd0
I‚Äôm a big fan of the Mkhi one,Manchester United,Yes,jalx2za,t1_jalagd0
SOMETIMES IIIIIIII JANUSAAAAJJJ,Manchester United,Yes,jaleis8,t1_jalagd0
and most of those aren‚Äôt dead rubber goals or assists either,Manchester United,Yes,jamwkv6,t1_jamp7a0
[deleted],Manchester United,Yes,jal8l8l,t1_jal77bz
McT did better in the earlier parts of the first half. It looked to me like he's currently being molded as an FDJ role replacement (but still incomplete). We'll have to wait and see if ETH could turn McT into something yet.,Manchester United,Yes,jalcz5k,t1_jal77bz
"The only case I can make is that our last 5 games is decent run in (only fulham in current top half and that‚Äôs at old Trafford) so if we can get to let 5 games within say 5 points then the pressure of a run in might affect the rivals, Arsenal in particular

Realistically though I think Arsenal getting that late win VS villa couple weeks ago was massive for them. Ended their mini bad patch and have won the next 2 after aswel so have momentum again.",Manchester United,Yes,jao78eu,t1_jao477a
Yeah they have done for a little while.,Manchester United,Yes,jaleoll,t1_jaleikn
"NGL, I thought he‚Äôs Scottish when I first heard of his name.",Manchester United,Yes,jal9a76,t1_jal3pmi
"Why? I would wager that Sabitzer is a similar  player and better than Mac Allister, if he brings his Leipzig form back, and will be much cheaper. 

If we need to get a player from Brighton, it must be Ferguson or Caicedo.",Manchester United,Yes,jalcm8y,t1_jal3pmi
What position does Mac Allister plays?,Manchester United,Yes,jal8kme,t1_jal3pmi
[deleted],Manchester United,Yes,jamd5r3,t1_jam5wdz
Just play into Rash strenghts so he can traumatize TAA for 10th time.,Manchester United,Yes,jamjtzu,t1_jam5wdz
Hopefully Mainoo is following Case everywhere and taking notes.,Manchester United,Yes,jaloydm,t1_jalm71g
Kane‚Äôs not young anymore,Manchester United,Yes,jame8t5,t1_jam1du0
"Modric for Real Madrid. He plays, they play otherwise it‚Äôs hope Benz and Vini produce magic. Same for us. Bruno or Rashy do something.",Manchester United,Yes,jalag6a,t1_jala1vd
"Casemiro is our only natural 6, we can't go into next season like this its just crazy. Offload McT, get a young natural 6 in to be Case's understudy. Manuel Ugarte (21) is my pick. His defensive number is [comparable](https://fbref.com/en/stathead/player_comparison.cgi?request=1&sum=0&comp_type=by_type&dom_lg=1&spec_comps=big_5&player_id1=4d224fe8&p1yrfrom=2022-2023&player_id2=c9817014&p2yrfrom=2022-2023) with Casemiro, some might argue he has better technical and ball safety than Casemiro and he has done a brilliant job taking over Palhinha's spot at Sporting and we all know how good Palhinha is.",Manchester United,Yes,jalkfx4,t1_jala1vd
People were saying it was illness,Manchester United,Yes,jamh6eg,t1_jamgme4
I read recurring tonsillitis somewhere,Manchester United,Yes,jamlqkx,t1_jamgme4
He is sick again so either its true or eth is dissapointed/punished him again we are covering for him.,Manchester United,Yes,jamjg4h,t1_jamgme4
FDJ and Kane for me,Manchester United,Yes,jaorx83,t1_jantvff
"Can Mbappe and Vini do it on a cold, rainy night away at stoke?",Manchester United,Yes,jam53rh,t1_jam2m6t
"Mbappe shouldn‚Äôt be in the conversation with Vini and Rashford. He‚Äôs a tier above them. And I think rashford is better than Vini, more versatile as a forward.",Manchester United,Yes,jamxdkf,t1_jam2m6t
"A few times he switched off with Victor.

Lucky it was West Ham and not a team with decent attackers!",Manchester United,Yes,jalnof5,t1_jalitsy
The only incident when Maguire was bad was when he lost Antonio through goal. Other than that he did well,Manchester United,Yes,jalzh14,t1_jalitsy
"I love De Gea, he is one of the best around when our defense crumbles and we need a miracle save, but I really don't know how sustainable our football can be him with him in goal. We don't involve him in the build up because Ten Hag doesn't trust his passing so we have one less player in the build up phase. We are making it work, but it's more difficult than it needs to be.

It's true De Gea has been very good at what he does best this season, he has saved us some points and he isn't a complete liability on the ball anymore so that's good. We aren't desperate to replace him with any semi-decent modern keeper anymore. However, there are a few names that would be big upgrades, Diogo Costa being one of them.",Manchester United,Yes,jambl5u,t1_jam5qt4
"Surely you don't think he is the best we can do?

We may not need immediate replacements for de gea but after 2-3 windows we should look to upgrade in his position.",Manchester United,Yes,jam6ynh,t1_jam5qt4
"Man just broke the club‚Äôs clean sheet record and still can‚Äôt catch a break. Fans will always have something to complain about winning or losing. Most of them never lived through the times of goalkeeping instability with the likes Barthez, taibi, carrol. I for one will take stability over a few fancy passes out from the back any day.",Manchester United,Yes,jambf8w,t1_jam5qt4
"Agreed. There's fair criticism to make, but there's users like the BBQ guy who can't for a moment celebrate the good stuff and only want to force their opinion on De Gea down everyone's throat.",Manchester United,Yes,jamd9ry,t1_jam5qt4
"We had an identity during Ole tenure too. There is a reason people go ""ole ball"" all the time in comments.",Manchester United,Yes,jalvyes,t1_jaluyg4
That run was without fan in the ground. This is more difficult! (Home crown can be a bit of pressure too),Manchester United,Yes,jalz3dv,t1_jaluyg4
"That would be a quadruple, not THE quadruple. Our treble was the treble, whereas when city won the domestic treble, it was a treble, not the treble. 

The distinction is worth clarifying üòâ",Manchester United,Yes,jamgqb2,t1_jamfx6p
"I used FanPass to get tickets to the game yesterday, they sting you a bit with the fees but they have notes that someone is a reputable seller.",Manchester United,Yes,jankrmw,t1_jamwq24
"There are three issues we have

1. The FFP rules get tighter each year for the next few years. Currently wages+buying has to match income+sales, next year it is 90% (then 80% the year after and finally 70%)
2. Our wage bill is high in comparison to other clubs, the club need to get control of big contracts
3. We are terrible at selling players. Last year about 6 players left on a free. We shouldn't be selling Rashford, but we need to be regularly getting about ¬£10M for some academy players and about ¬£30M for more established players who no longer suit us",Manchester United,Yes,jann4gn,t1_jang8fe
"Yeah i think it's because he is young, just worried he will say something not in the script. And also its a way of protecting young players from the media's hunger, coz you never know what kind of stupid questions the media will ask provoking the players.",Manchester United,Yes,jalam07,t1_jal9a6n
Maybe his English isn‚Äôt great? Basing that on nothing btw,Manchester United,Yes,jal9gd3,t1_jal9a6n
"Suppose it‚Äôs possible, but i think eth rates him.",Manchester United,Yes,jannujf,t1_janl76o
"His wages mean he'd be a difficult sell so unless Ten Hag really deems him surplus to requirements, then we'll keep him for 23/24 at the very least. 

Sancho to me feels like a player who will step up a few levels as our play style becomes more settled into Ten Hag's vision. The only question to me is if he can handle the required off the ball work rate.",Manchester United,Yes,jansia7,t1_janl76o
"The other one is more of a meme and random subreddit, it‚Äôs much more loosely moderated.

Green and gold until we‚Äôre sold: Manchester United used to be Newton Heath which had green and gold colors, some fans wear those colors to not provide cash to our leech owners.",Manchester United,Yes,jal5tsl,t1_jal36mf
"Green and gold were United‚Äôs colours waaaay back when we were still Newton Heath. Since the glazer takeover we‚Äôve used those colours as a visual display of the protests against the ownership, people wear green/gold scarves at games and so on. 

‚ÄúGreen and gold til the club is sold‚Äù is the mantra.",Manchester United,Yes,jal59uc,t1_jal36mf
Both should be sold and could give us quite a bit of money tbh,Manchester United,Yes,janswei,t1_jan9wi7
I can‚Äôt say I get the chance to watch much Ligue 1 unfortunately,Manchester United,Yes,jalw72l,t1_jalbvnl
Nope.,Manchester United,Yes,jalwqfw,t1_jalwhpy
I don't think you can exclusively rely on set pieces at this level. JWP isn't up to much when he's not standing over a dead ball.,Manchester United,Yes,jalyi3i,t1_jalwhpy
He'd be a huge upgrade on current squad rotation players. That's what I'm looking forward to is having our squad players on a high enough level they'd start for a lot of prem teams,Manchester United,Yes,jalwnqt,t1_jalwhpy
Also want to know,Manchester United,Yes,jamc2es,t1_jam959l
Dm me as well please!,Manchester United,Yes,jamcupp,t1_jam959l
Let me get home from work and i can show you where i got mine from :),Manchester United,Yes,jamle2u,t1_jam959l
"Makes sense tbh - all Greenwood discussion aside, there are a lot of people who strictly want the most talented players on the pitch. If you only rate players as individuals you‚Äôre gonna miss a lot of the value that Weghorst brings to the team out of possession or off ball.",Manchester United,Yes,jan6503,t1_jan51cu
Care to back that up?,Manchester United,Yes,jang5vd,t1_jan51cu
"Below par but there is mitigating circumstances. As we speed up our play, he‚Äôll be better - but there‚Äôs no denying we got bumped by Dortmund. I did say he wasn‚Äôt what we needed at the time and we should have went for Raphina but alas everything happens for a reason. We‚Äôve got ETHnand I trust him completely.",Manchester United,Yes,jalwlum,t1_jaltb1b
Needs to score again against Liverpool,Manchester United,Yes,jalv4tx,t1_jaltb1b
"Has definitely been underwhelming & hasn't justified his huge fee.

Mitigating factors; Last season was a proper shitshow & didn't give him a good platform to bed into the team. He's had to deal with personal matters that meant he didn't build the same momentum as the team has over the last 6 months.

Positives;  Still 22 (23 end month) so can still develop into the elite player we know he can become. Has come up with clutch goals in crucial moments for us, what we just need is that more consistently. 

I trust in Ten Hag & can see him turning Sancho into a beast.",Manchester United,Yes,jalupak,t1_jaltb1b
"The price and contract are out of his control and are high due to Woodwards shit negotiating tactics. He's clearly a talented player and has been suffering mentally, potentially from being in the United Squad during the last few depressing years. Under ETH, everyone's getting better, so I'm excited to see him more",Manchester United,Yes,jalx0nc,t1_jaltb1b
"I still rate him heavily because I know what he is capable of when he is well. Barring one or two random times when he was actually not well, anytime you see ""Ill"" it's mental health related. I'm glad the stigma around athletics has changed because, mental health really can destroy your physical attributes. He's surrounded by a place and team of love and great doctors at United now - watch this space after March and next season, you won't believe you ever doubted him and Antony.",Manchester United,Yes,jam1k22,t1_jaltb1b
"Last season was utter dogshit for everyone and this season he‚Äôs had his off the field issues.

I won‚Äôt race to judgement and call him a flop just yet, but it‚Äôs fair to say he‚Äôs been quite underwhelming since his transfer.  

I‚Äôd probably give him until the end of next season to see if he can turn it around and I‚Äôd not start actively looking to sell.  If Greenwood returns then Jadon could realistically be out 6th choice wide man, and that wage for a fringe player just isn‚Äôt justifiable.",Manchester United,Yes,jalwtbv,t1_jaltb1b
"Jury's still out for sure but I do have hopes for him. Clear to see that Erik doesn't really see him as a pacey winger a la Garnacho, Antony and is playing him a lot more centrally which is where he'll thrive a lot more.",Manchester United,Yes,jaltwig,t1_jaltb1b
"Little bit of an awkward situation in my opinion. I think when we become more of a 'Ten Hag team', in that we start taking more control in games and having more sustained attacking pressure, with his close control and ability to pass in crowded areas he could do really well. 

I don't think he's dynamic or athletic enough to excel in the side currently. If we're looking at signing a top striker in the summer, Rashford will be a constant on the left with Garnacho his backup which leaves Sancho behind Bruno as the #10 and behind Antony on the right, with a decision to be made over Amad as well. Given his wages I think it's hard to justify him in that sort of role.",Manchester United,Yes,jam2s10,t1_jaltb1b
"Give him one more year, then cut our losses. We have spent 150+ on right side wingers and yet it‚Äôs bland.",Manchester United,Yes,jalvhs3,t1_jaltb1b
"in the last two years, sterling maybe?",Manchester United,Yes,jan6a27,t1_jan5fgx
"Might be unfair due to injury, but Kalvin Phillips?",Manchester United,Yes,janebux,t1_jan5fgx
Elon Musk,Manchester United,Yes,jalm53q,t1_jal8dhv
I think there‚Äôs a longer clip where he stands up when there‚Äôs a chance and applauds as soon as it goes in! The shot of him just staring into the distance came just after,Manchester United,Yes,jalr0ij,t1_jalqqas
Nah no chance he felt that way lol - end of the day he still scored the big game winner,Manchester United,Yes,jalszv2,t1_jalqqas
"I always thought the winning goal was the goal that actually won the game, not the last goal of the game.",Manchester United,Yes,jalvb3e,t1_jalqqas
"Mate, we started with a backup back line and back-up midfield. Still created loads in the first. Against a PL team at full strength. Chill.",Manchester United,Yes,jam4snt,t1_jam42qn
"Don't forget that we are 9ish months in to ETH tenure, two transfer windows, one of which only consisted of loan deals. We're in a better position than even the most hopeful fan thought we would be and played the most games in Europe with a squad lacking quality depth. If we lose, then we lose and move on. We're heading in the right direction, just look fatigued and lacking solid depth. We're on the up with brighter days ahead.",Manchester United,Yes,jam96yi,t1_jam42qn
"I love that Ten Hag demands high standards, but yours are just delusional. You can't control every game for the full 90 minutes and only create pure goals without any mistakes or luck involved. 

Even 08/09 Bar√ßa got 5 points from 5 games in the league at the end. It's just not possible.",Manchester United,Yes,jamdv3o,t1_jam42qn
Lol,Manchester United,Yes,jam4j5g,t1_jam42qn
"I do agree with parts of it. But not everything.

Yes. The chances of us signing him are slim given that he‚Äôs not unhappy at Tottenham and the club loves him. He‚Äôs one of their best players ever. He‚Äôs historically relevant but also brilliant today. So low odds he moves. And even if he does. The price will be insane.

But that said. The 30 year old thing is bullshit given that this isn‚Äôt FIFA and there‚Äôs no ‚Äúon switch‚Äù for regression that kicks in this season. His style of play isn‚Äôt centered in insane running speeds or miles covered like some other players (Mbappe first to come to mind). He won‚Äôt suddenly fall off a cliff. That‚Äôs unfair. You get at least 3 world class seasons from him in which time you bring up new talent.

I‚Äôd see him being similar to RVP. And in that vein.

The team rn has 10 quality starters to depend upon (assuming you don‚Äôt think we need a new GK). Striker is our only concern. Rashford is our only goal scorer and that‚Äôs not ideal. If ETH thinks that there‚Äôs a young striker he‚Äôd rather have, or just believes in; then I respect that. He knows the game better than I ever will. But. Let‚Äôs not forget that Kane is the closest thing to a sure shot we can ever find in this market.

He‚Äôs not switching levels of competition or countries. He fits the style ETH wants being a striker who can play in the buildup similar to what he asked of Martial. Plus he was extremely successful in a goal scoring duo with Son. Whether they tel as players and people is yet to be seen. But they have the makings of a successful deep lying forward and the winger who runs off his shoulder.

On paper. The only clash would be how Bruno and him fit together. But then again. Bruno could play more to the right or something. Having all three of them is a good problem to have.

We are currently dark horses for a PL title charge. We destroyed a Barca team that pundits and fans have been pulling hard for and praising.

I‚Äôd be apprehensive of the price and age if we were a shit team and needed 10 new starters. But this isn‚Äôt that.

Also. With age. YeahZ players decline. But what made Ronaldo and Sanchez bad moves wasn‚Äôt just age.  It more that they were already declining.

Arsenal fans always knew. I think Juve fans knew too.

Kane has don‚Äôt anything but show signs of regressing",Manchester United,Yes,jan55ct,t1_jamxo1e
"He told Spurs he wanted to leave in 2021. He's also made no secret of the fact he wants to win trophies. It's a big possibility that he pushes for a move soon. Kane will also be a top striker well into his 30s. Why on earth would you not want Kane? A guy who guarantees goals and has an amazing all round game too

I'd personally prefer Osimhen but if Kane becomes available and Osimhen isn't then obviously we should be all over him",Manchester United,Yes,jan197h,t1_jamxo1e
"Why he would want to leave :- to win an actual trophy

Why he would want to join us :- to win an actual trophy 

Why we would want him : - he's a world class striker who doesn't rely on pace and would immediately elevate our team and help us win trophies for 4/5 years.",Manchester United,Yes,jan1hh1,t1_jamxo1e
"Well this is simply not true, it‚Äôs currently listed as Thursday / Saturday and is 44 hours apart. The Fulham game is also not finalised for Saturday, it will 100% move to Sunday",Manchester United,Yes,jalfymd,t1_jalel8q
"Games especially League games get moved easily to ease the Europe playing teams, np need to worry now",Manchester United,Yes,jalivnd,t1_jalel8q
The Brighton game is most likely postponed since both us and them are in the FA quarters. Will end up playing the FA tie on its date instead.,Manchester United,Yes,jalfvqk,t1_jalel8q
"Strange, for 20m I'd snap Munich hand off it would be a steal.",Manchester United,Yes,jali7t0,t1_jalh29s
He can replace McTominay,Manchester United,Yes,jali8mw,t1_jalh29s
Not taking midfielder recommendations from a username like that,Manchester United,Yes,jalsd2r,t1_jalh29s
"You are right, ignore these guys

Sabitzer was also poor yesterday but escaped cricitsm. Had 7 more touches than McT while playing 80 mins 

He isn't better than Eriksen or Fred atm",Manchester United,Yes,jam0kt7,t1_jalh29s
"People gush because we got a player who is a solid fit when we had no money and really needed an extra body. Imagine our season without Weghorst. 

I don‚Äôt care if we keep him permanently and yes he‚Äôs a limited player but I‚Äôll always remember him fondly just for how he never stops running even though he starts every single match. 

You talking about Osimhen, that‚Äôs nice, do we have 150 mil to sign him?

No one thinks Wout is our long term CF. It‚Äôs just nice to see a guy come in last moment for next to no financial commitment and make a solid impact.",Manchester United,Yes,jaldhcr,t1_jalb80g
"Weghorst is much more valuable to the team than Martial, simply because of availability. Even a terrible player (which he is not) will score at least some fluke goals sometimes, which will be more than a good player who is permainjured

I do not mind signing Weghorst for about 10m in the summer to be BACKUP to whoever we sign as starting striker at all",Manchester United,Yes,jalg0x8,t1_jalb80g
">I fully recognize and appreciate that he puts in a shift and hustles his ass off, but he really does miss a ton of golden opportunities and we have been so lucky to not have been burned by them.

I wont even read the wall of text you have written after that. 

What golden chances are these that he misses? Chances? Sure. Golden? No way. I can easily point out to Rashy, Sancho, Garnacho, Antony and Bruno missing plenty of golden chances through out the season. 

You have completely missed the point if you think ""hustle bustle"" is all he brings. He is an extremely technical player, and ties up a lot of our forward players with great passing, lay offs, and just brutal physicality in the box and runs, that opens up space for others to have these ""golden chances"". 

I live in Germany, for work, and have quite a few Wolfsburg fans around me, and they bang on about one particular thing: You buy Weghorst to due the role of Giroud in your team, and not one of a Kane, Haaland or Oshimen. This is what Burnley fucked up at. We are clearly doing extremely well with our team, as he is the first point of pressing, and is excellent at through balls and layoffs. That ain't just ""hustle bustle"".",Manchester United,Yes,jalcbac,t1_jalb80g
"Well, he gives us tactical flexibility. He can be a decent backup striker even if we sign a new striker this summer. Martial is just unreliable.

There's nothing to lose if we sign him and he wants to be a second choice striker. His strengths outweigh his weaknesses, his finishing isn't good but he helps others score by pressing high, dragging defenders, providing assists, and linking up with other players. Weghorst gives his all for the club and fans love this type of player.",Manchester United,Yes,jalbv6q,t1_jalb80g
"Sorry pal, you're just milea off. 

Weghorst was bought as a sub in the middle of a shortage. It isn't a question of him or Osihmen.",Manchester United,Yes,jalij2i,t1_jalb80g
"And Osimhen wont work out with Rashy or Antony, he needs Sancho or Bruno to play wide and create chances, go watch Napoli matches, without Kvara, Osimhen wont be effective. What we need is ST who can hold up and create chances too, like Martial, Benzema or Kane.",Manchester United,Yes,jals599,t1_jalb80g
"Nobody is saying let's keep him as our number 9 next season, I am not really sure why you have spent all this time to write this out.

The guy was signed as a stop gap to do a job for us where we were lacking and didn't have funds to buy anyone. He might not have scored goals but if we are winning games and he is contributing towards that then he is more than his worth in terms of the deal and I think would be a great option for our squad.

"Few recent examples of our failings in transfer market:

Williams would have been a 10mill player that half the PL would have had a punt on had we not given him a long term 60k pw deal rendering his wages unaffordable to most bottom half / mid table PL clubs

Tuanzebe after his successful loan at villa and then getting promoted was being linked with 30mill permanent move, we kept him around, never really used bar to cover CB injury emergencies and he has been unfortunate with injuries himself since and will now surely leave on a free this coming summer

Lingard after successful loan could have commanded 20mill fee, we apparantly wanted 30mill, he hardly played the following year while picking up 100k pw then left on a free

Henderson probably for last 3 summers we could have gotten 20-30mill fee. He has spent 1 season rotating the cup games, 1 with practically no game time for us, and now 1 on loan at forest

Speaking of forest, moneybags Forrest would surely have paid 15-20mill for garner last summer at start of window but we dithered, ended up selling at end of window when forest had already secured other targets so we got at the time what looked like a poor price of 9mill

Feel like those examples (all academy graduates) could have secured us somewhere better 100 and 120 mill, enough to sign potentially 2 or 3 first team starting 11 quality players. So far only garner has generated a fee lingard has left on a free, tuanzebe surely will this summer, Williams might get us 5million and Henderson potentially might still get us around 20mill but his salary limits the fee clubs will pay for him. we have left alot of money on the table with that lot",Manchester United,Yes,jao2qom,t1_jann4gn
There‚Äôs gotta be translators and interviewers who can speak Spanish from us,Manchester United,Yes,jal9j1m,t1_jal9gd3
"Yeah I do too but looking at the squad and its strengths and weaknesses, if someone like FDJ was available but we could only make the move if we sold Sancho, I think the squad is better off if we make the deal. 

Not saying it's likely just that Sancho is a player with resale value that we probably could spare.",Manchester United,Yes,janogan,t1_jannujf
"Would Bayern be a shout? He has massive reputation in Germany still and set that league alight for a couple years, Bayern maybe the only German club that could put a transfer package together that could tempt us to sell and sancho to go. Only other club I can think of is Chelsea if they wanna boost their English quote

Realistically though I think he gets at least 1 more year to show his potential here. I‚Äôm hoping he can get over all these illnesses he has been having and can get a consistent period where he is available between now and end of the season

Feel like next preseason is gonna he huge for him, make an impression and he can work his way back into team (he is still super young) but if he struggles for rest of season and doesn‚Äôt standout in preseason he could fall further down the pecking order with garnacho further establishing himself and potentially amad coming back in too to try and cement a place in 1st team squad",Manchester United,Yes,jao09ky,t1_jansia7
Thanks for the reply! Very informative.,Manchester United,Yes,jalj7bn,t1_jal5tsl
"Probably not the main reason to keep them around but we literally have a quota of homegrown players that we need to keep so we can register full 25 man PL squad (8homegrown minimum) and we are actually quite close to that at the moment

Last summer perreira, lingard, pogba all left. Of homegrown players currently contracted, Greenwood might never play for us again. Henderson will probably be sold as he isn‚Äôt happy to be a backup and I don‚Äôt think he is getting the number 1 jersey next season, tuanzebe / Jones almost certain to leave on frees, heaton is old and contract up in summer though I hope/think we try to keep him as backup for another season, no space in squad for Williams who will surely be sold, awb is impressing atm but it‚Äôs pretty clear as recently as January ETH would have been happy to cash in had a replacement been available. There is question marks over Sancho suitability in ETH team. Even rashford and shaw are coming Into final year of contract though I think it‚Äôs clear we will try to retain both

So that leaves mcT and maguire‚Ä¶. I think maguire will possibly leave as probably knows he isn‚Äôt breaking up the licha / varane partnership and I think we might actually target another CB in the summer too. If mcT is happy to stay around as a backup / depth option which I think is more likely than maguire wanting to stay as a backup then I think we should absolutely keep him

Sourcing homegrown players to fill that quota isn‚Äôt cheap!!

I guess the club will hope that garnacho, mainoo, elanga, mejbri plus others who already do or could all qualify as homegrown will in long term help us maintain required quota",Manchester United,Yes,jao5p81,t1_janswei

Again with a lame assumption. We don't even know if ETH wants him or he would be suited for his style. Its clear he wants De Jong because he fits his system but why would he want a 30-year-old striker with no pace who will cost north of 100 m on his team?

Ireland actually,Manchester United,Yes,jalmnp2,t1_jalc52z
"You should read up on his interviews on where he prefers to play or where he plays for Argentina. He is exactly like Sabitzer was for RB. A box to box player who prefers to be more on the creative side of things. Not as creative as Bruno or KDB, neither as defensive as Casemiro. 

He plays a double pivot in Brighton, but the defensive duties are shared with Caicedo doing majority of it. Just because he picks up from deeper positions, doesn't mean he isn't a box to box player.",Manchester United,Yes,jalfwr5,t1_jalfn1i
"He would be an upgrade in Fred and Scott. He can play Rm or Central. Fred's current form is brilliant, but he hasn't been playing like this for the last 5 years, so although he won't have his energy, he is a better footballer",Manchester United,Yes,jamhhwo,t1_jam0664

">Smarter business would be tielemans or rabiot on a free

Even more smart business would be not touching Rabiot at all.

Also, Sabitzer is well better than Tielemans; the latter was always gassed out by 65 minutes even in his prime. And they're different players to begin with.

Sabitzer has taken to the league as duck to water. He's been on the bench at Bayern for 6 months, came here about a month ago; new team, new manager, new league/country; and yet he's slotted in right away. After a good pre-season he'll even be better.",Manchester United,Yes,jalirey,t1_jaliecs

"Yeah on a permanent deal as a squad player, not let's sign him instead of a new number 9. Martial can't even make the bench 70% of the time so we still need 2 strikers realistically.

I don‚Äôt agree I think with the limited budget that we have that money can be better spent on actually upgrading our starting XI instead of buying players to sit on the bench.

"These are objectively good players and would be free + younger. Allowing us to free up funds to get better players for the starting XI, I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs not smarter. Ten hag also wanted rabiot so it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs a shit player.",Manchester United,Yes,jallqae,t1_jalljvq

Yet Wout comes in, does the same types of things and we get excited about it because it‚Äôs new.

1) Could fans stop pretending his first reign was a failure, it elevated us as a club even if we didnt win a cup and it was way more fun than it was right now

2) Levy has spent 300 million since his depature and playing Poch's brand of aggressive football would need athletic players so its not that if Poch comes he wont ask for new players. If anything a manager who plays with a front foot would demand more players than a manager with a mid-block

"The only players Arteta has kept around that were at the club before him that are considered part of his 14-15 best players are Saka and Martinelli, who were both basically youth players and extremely motivated to prove themselves to Arteta.

Is it really a coincidence that it took replacing literally all of the other players in order for them to look like a competent team again, going from 5th to 1st? Jesus and Zinchenko have been good for them but definitely aren't the biggest factor, considering they've been injured for large parts of the season and their team still plays well.

The biggest factor was getting rid of Laca, Bellerin, Pepe, Leno, Torreira and Maitland Niles in the summer. You need hungry players if you want to progress.

Compare that to our team. Son, Kane, Lloris, Dier, Davies are all considered starters in our strongest XI. That's the spine and about half of the squad that's slowly rotted over what, 6+ years?

Smith Rowe was brought on to at 22nd minute to replace an injured Trossard, and then himself was subbed by R. Nelson at 69 mins. He turned out to be the match winner at the very end.

Ten Hag has also done the same to win some games when levels dropped in some games at Man United. Using bench players to change tactics and change games.

Would Conte and the coaching team have done the same? I think he has the capability to do so, but it's beginning to look the same sad story every match we are stuck at 0-0 or behind.

"I sadly think that we have to crash and burn to be successful in the future, otherwise we‚Äôll continue to sleepwalk towards mediocrity.

Levy still thinks that his bullshit way of running the  club will get us top 4 every year, and in the past decade it has or has come close to. Not enough investment In the squad, no strategy, no long term plan, bad buys and changing managers every time top 4 seems to be in danger. We need to spend a couple seasons midtable for him to understand that it doesn‚Äôt work like that anymore, especially when Son and Kane are gone who have been carrying us for years. 

The only way to be successful nowadays is to through a long term strategy when it comes to squad building and showing faith in a manager, especially when you can see that he is building something. Consistent investment in the squad, especially into quality over quantity, something this club knows nothing about. We need to start buying seasoned players In their prime for 35-50m, instead we go and spend 20-25m on youngsters that are nowhere near the required level and turn out to be a complete waste. 

Get in an attacking manager  that plays possession based attacking football and give him time. Allow him to build a squad. Sacrifice top 4 for a few years. But these owners only want to increase the value of the club, it‚Äôs an investment to them and nothing else. Best way to do that without having to spend much is scrapping 4th place every season, it gives you a lot of money and raises the profile of the club being in the biggest competition, so you can then in return ask for more when a buyer comes sniffing or when we try to sell the stadium rights.",Spurs,No,jazgisj,t3_11ip9xr

I do think were signing young quality players again which is great but I do question what the clubs plan is, we sign Conte, ready made manager and yet we sign the opposite of players he wants to sign. 

At the end of the day, the clubs sending mixed messages, pick a side and stick with it, if we commit to Conte then sign ready players, now were in this weird confused state where the players arent mentally ready and it shows on the pitch.

"If we move to a 4-3-3/4‚Äì2-3-1 I the summer, which positions would you reinforce with either starters/squad players? Obviously keep it sort of realistic since in reality half the squad needs to be changers

I think first choice GK, LCB and creative mid are absolute must‚Äôs. We‚Äôll be in big trouble if those 3 positions don‚Äôt get done. Another almost must will be a new forward, preferably LW. Son has been terrible for 2/3 of a season by this point and will be 31, It would be a mistake to further rely on him. Kane is backed up by Richy and Kulu can be backed up by either Gil or Perisic. 

Fullbacks should not be a priority this summer, Porro&Royal on the right with Udogie/ Davies/Reggie on the left is decent enough for now. Sess needs to be  binned asap.

Midfield is sort of alright, with Bentacur coming back halfway through next season I think we‚Äôll be ok. But we need to get the Creative Mid at all costs. Have GLC back him up, not ideal but it is what it is. 

LCB is huge one and we need to bring in quality to be paired with Romero. It doesn‚Äôt have to be Gvardiol but it has to be better than Guehi for example. Also another CB as depth, we can‚Äôt rely on Sanchez,Dier and Tanganga in a back 4, even as squad players.

So to conclude, GK,LCB,creative mid have to be starters, an LW that is rotation/starter and at least another CB that is rotation.",Spurs,No,jazkujq,t3_11ip9xr

Hey all. I‚Äôm going to my first game on Wednesday and was wondering what options I have for purchasing a kit at the stadium.

"I'm curious.  I'm not from UK and didn't grow up watching EPL (or its predecessor).  I have no prior experience and I'm observing from a distance.  I guess I'm saying that I didn't build up animosity for our rivals from my youth, proximity to other fans, and prior disappointments.  For instance, I can imagine that if one lives near Tottenham then they are exposed to lots of Arsenal fans.  I can readily see how lifelong animus can develop.  I have a strong dislike for my football team's nearest geographic rivals in American football.   

For those of you from the UK can you rank your level of vitriol for other top 6 teams---and maybe why you have them in that order.  

for example here is mine.  remember I live an ocean away and was not a fan until my 60's about 10 years ago.

1. Chelsea--as a newcomer, I studied the history of the prominent EPL teams.  My research indicated that Chelsea had the vilest fans in terms of racism and other bad behavior.   Russian oligarch oil money. the hated Diego Costa played for them 2014-2017 in my formative years.  Plus, I've been told that parts of Chelsea are among the most wealthy in London.
2. Arsenal---I'm Spurs.  Fortunately, I didn't suffer through the early EPL Wenger period.  I don't know many Gooners.  Where I live there are a couple of very active Spurs fan clubs as visible as any Arsenal fan clubs.
3. ManCity--Fuck oil money.
4. ManU--like Arsenal, I've not experienced a real dominant period by United.  I understand how globally massive they are, but again not where I live.
5. Liverpool--Liverpool is by far the most popular EPL team in my area.  I enjoy their local fan club and generally root for them when not playing Spurs or unless their loss would benefit the Spurs.  I had mixed emotions on Sunday trying to figure out which result would benefit the Spurs most.",Spurs,No,jb4z8en,t3_11ip9xr

Spurs,Spurs,Yes,jazt7du,t1_jazsvxf
"Well, my thinking is that Kane has told the team that if he wins the free kick, he's taking it. No questions (Perisic won the free kick that Porro hit the bar from and Kane won the free kick that he took himself). 

He definitely should have given that free kick to Porro though for the sake of the team, I feel like he has the scoring record in his head now. Ngl I feel like that was really selfish from Kane considering Porro's in the first half was the best direct free kick I think we've seen in years (I can't remember our last direct free kick goal?)",Spurs,Yes,jb0clzd,t1_jazsvxf
"At this point Kane is desperate to get goals so that he can get at least some kind of personal accolade whilst he's in a team that won't win anything.

"This is the mad thing. We had 2 title runs, a load of semis and champs league final.

That's actually quality and not a million miles off what klopp managed at Liverpool, just klopp managed to get it over the line more often and hence why is considered a better manager. And poch did all this whilst barely spending. 

Even at the dumpster fire that is PSG he managed to win the league at a canter. Didn't get UCL but neither has Tuchel Ancellotti Emery or any of them. 

I get being cautious about going back and maybe there is a better option out there, but he's certainly not a bad option to have at all. And the football would be....watchable!",Spurs,Yes,jb05aen,t1_jb03g32
"The biggest problem will be that  we don‚Äôt have young energetic players anymore. We can‚Äôt counter press like we used to. Kane and Son are 30 now and can‚Äôt really press. Our only really good pressing comes from Kulu and Bentancur. Hojbjerg is way too slow. Plus our defence would be a complete disaster if they tried to play a high line. 

Even if Poch comes we won‚Äôt be able to play that style of play we had before. I don‚Äôt think he would be a good fit for us right now.",Spurs,Yes,jb04pj8,t1_jb03g32
"I get all of that, but IMO Poch makes more sense as a plan C. Pochettino also had problems with making substitutions and he kind of lost the dressing room at the end. I also remember Kane and Poch not really getting along at the end (which might be more on Kane but the point is the same). 

Also imo, I just think De Zerbi and Gallardo are much more exciting options than Pochettino is, so I want us to shoot our shot with them first. I wouldn't mind bringing Poch back though.

"You need continual churn.  That doesn't mean that you have to get rid of players, but you need competition and to keep selecting the best out of that churn.

At Spurs until recently we seem to have a general mindset of - ""buy youngsters who will grow into the team"".  That means most of our best players are not competing for their position, and the results speak for themselves - with the exception of Kane and Son - who are basically outliers in the EPL in terms of the culture/mindset.",Spurs,Yes,jb0nig1,t1_jb0ar0s
"I mean don't forget he signed Willian and also was the one who offered Aubameyang a huge new contract.

"I honestly didn't even watch scum games at all this season apart from the ones against us and them against Chelsea at the bridge.

"I was also excited about him and to be fair I think he‚Äôs done some good things. You can tell that he‚Äôs a veteran player with lots of experience for sure. However that doesn‚Äôt really matter at this point. I dread to see him start and especially alongside Son. 

This system puts a lot of emphasis on wingbacks and I‚Äôm sure it can be effective but right now it‚Äôs not working. Yesterday both Perisic and Porro hugged the sideline for 90% of the game. Giving the ball to our wingbacks who run down their respective lanes and proceeds to try and get the ball into the box usually result in the following things: A defender clearing the ball away, the goalkeeper catching the ball or a corner kick. Very rarely does it ever lead to a goal and this tactic is just too predictable. 

What I like about Emerson is that he often goes into a more central position and help out in the midfield. I‚Äôve noticed when we lose games our players are often very static and rigid in their position. But for the past 3 games that we won it was more dynamic with players covering more areas, Kane dropping deeper trying to help out, I don‚Äôt understand why they didn‚Äôt do this yesterday. I quite frankly don‚Äôt understand this system at all. How can it go from last season to this.

He is interesting though, and he definitely has cool ideas about football. I loved how well his side played the first half against Chelsea, moving really well in tight spaces.

"Levy has washed his hands with the footballing side of things.
Yeah, he can be criticized for taking too much of it during Pochs time here (part of that though was Poch being difficult with DOFs tbh) but since then, he has taken a step back, he has handed the footballing duties off to Paratici who has been building a new system behind the scenes since coming now.

Levy IMO can't be criticized for turning us into a commercial giant, the more the better IMO, it has no real impact on the pitch, other than bringing in more income for the managers to spend.

I personally think that what Levy can be blamed for is hiring Conte. I get why he did but it was the wrong choice for the club.
For example, I disagree with thinking that Paratici has had a middling bag, I think he has been great so far. The signings coming in overall have been of a high quality, minus Perisic but that's a Conte signing overall.

Richarlison could be amazing for us, not under conte though.

It‚Äôs guys like Dier, Sanchez, Tanganga, Lloris etc who‚Äôve caused us the problems this season. All bought in before Paratici arrived. Sure Bissouma, Richarlison etc have underwhelmed but the squad has far bigger problems.

Throw in the frequent criticism of the transfer policy and I think it's very clear that us and him simply aren't a good fit.

"My biggest concern is that after 18 months of almost exclusively playing 343 we have no consistency whatsoever. Backing Conte further is putting all our eggs in the 343 basket and I'm not at all convinced it's the right setup for us.

Having Kane but not playing a creative midfielder just doesn't sit well with me. I look at the top 3 with their Odegaards, de Bruynes, Bernardo Silvas, Fernandezes and Eriksens with petty jealousy. 

When they're on any sort of form we arguably have the best front 3 in the league but we're not getting the best out of them with our style of play and they're all suffering because of it. Funneling the majority of our attacks to the wings seems one-dimensional and largely ineffective in comparison. 

If it was up to me we'd go for a manager that plays a fluid 433 or 4213. I'm sick of playing on the back foot all the time - it's not what the best teams do and we should always aim to eventually be the best team - if not then what's the point of it all?",Spurs,Yes,jb0ctyh,t1_jb04nym

Also, there can be multiple people working on deals at a multibillion pound company.

Agree unless we can overtake Man U somehow. I also agree on the CB situation.

I'd say that's a negative more than a positive. 



>And poch did all this whilst barely spending. 

He spent ‚Ç¨440,480,000 in 5 years as manager, that's 88m per season. That's roughly 5m less per year than Artetas current total spend at Arsenal, and he has already won an FA cup (might be more? Not sure ). But the Poch didn't spend thing isn't true",Spurs,Yes,jb0cm1o,t1_jb05aen

I do agree about Kane, Son and Hojbjerg so this is I wont be surprised if Son becomes more of a bench player like Defoe soon and I also wont be surprised if Hojbjerg might be sold if Poch comes as in addition to him being slow, his lack of press resistance would also be something which Poch hates",Spurs,Yes,jb05bzp,t1_jb04pj8

Do you think if we don't get the top 4? That f1 strategic money will help us? Will Levy spend as much as arsenal did? 

We're at the edge of getting overtaken by Newcastle. And next year. Chelsea will be back in the mix. So will Liverpool.

>If spurs are getting money from F1 to go into the club, then in turn that money can be spent on the club

or we could focus on the field. Use the fact that we lucked into possibly the greatest striker in the premier league and the fact that he's in his prime. And that we have a limited window to win and winning always gets you more sponsors, more collaborators and more strategic partnerships.  

We had Kane and Son and we wasted away their best years. Son maybe is in Decline. If Kane hits that decline. We're fucked. How are you going to find a 20+ goal striker?

>Or we can not generate any money and you can spend every transfer window crying out your arse about how we don't spend anything?

Except that the money never gets spent or gets spent in horrible ways.  We have a window. We've signed one elite defender since 2015. An area we all know we need to spend on.  But we don't.  

And trust me if we miss out on the top 4 this season. They will not spend like Arsenal did. The poor manager whoever he is will be told to first get the top 4 and then maybe and maybe he gets some players.

We're on manager number 14 or 15 I don't remember which now but when are Spurs fans going to stop chasing their own tail by going after managers and start attacking the source of the problem the ownership? That's why I stopped attacking managers because we've gone through so many they all can't be horrible and tactically inept.

Look at how you're behaving after only a year of having Antonio Conte, I know for a fact many Spurs fans aren't ready for a long term project like they keep preaching about.

A trophy Conte got knocked out of and said cretin won. Jose was a flop for us of course but for me a top 4 finish is literally all that will separate him and Conte by the time the summer rolls around and he leaves.,Spurs,Yes,jb01rcu,t1_jb01m2b
I respect this answer a lot. I think a lot of spurs fans disrespect Jose's character and misdirect their anger on that when it really its his football that is the problem. Jose tried to be a nice guy on spurs as well. It just didn't work out. Hopefully poch saves us. I wish we would try to go after De Zerbi or Gallardo though.,Spurs,Yes,jb0rhw7,t1_jb0ocgq
"yea maybe Ten Hag was off his game too. Can't blame him/united players b/c they're coming off two weeks of high tension/pressure games, all culminating with a cup win.

I wouldn't say Potter is a great manager. I may have been too tough on him previously but clearly Potter is not good enough for a top 4 club. He is a decent  midtable manager. He makes a lot of sense for a club like West Ham.,Spurs,Yes,jb0xo4y,t1_jb0xe41

">In the same way liverpool and Chelsea are transitioning right now? Or City are even having a mini transition now but are still going to win the league anyway. (City are on course for their lowest points total in 5 years or something) 

I don't get the point of this comment? I doesn't in any way make the fact you lost out to Leicester less valid? Especially when it was long lauded as your golden years with Erikson, Deli, Vertongen etc. What does this year have to do with it? 

>Arteta has spent ¬£410m since becoming arsenal manager, so in ‚Ç¨ that's roughly the same as poch did....Except Arteta has done it in nearly half the time.

I know what a counter press is you don't have to explain it! So we are only 1 centreback away from playing with one....and we are going to upgrade 2 CBs in the summer anyway? 

I don't really see a problem with it at all tbh",Spurs,Yes,jb0jl9x,t1_jb07blf

"I'm not really sure we do need all that stuff. Very few teams other than city have that level of depth. I mean look at arsenal putting together a title run with an incredibly thin squad.
And realistically we aren't signing 8 quality players in one window, that'd be like ¬£400m. Unless you kean for the rebuild in which case I agree!

In terms of nezt season i dont think we need a backup Rw desperately, that's what Richi is for. LB I think will be Udogie or Ben davies, Davies being a decent option if you play Porro at Rb and need a more defensive lb, could even see Regi being kept on under poch he's much better with a back 4. 

If poch came back I do wonder if he'd have another go at GLC as well tbh, although I hope not given his injuries.",Spurs,Yes,jazihev,t1_jazh8wh
"It was everything to do with the stadium why we didn't spend very much before then. 

That summer we spent ‚Ç¨100m on sess ndombele and Jack Clarke. We also spent anywhere up to 20m on GLC loan fee as we tried to help them get around their sell on fee by doing an expensive loan fee and cheaper signing fee. 

So yeah that summer we spent ‚Ç¨120m (and then another 30 in Jan on bergwijn)

Also very true!,Spurs,Yes,jb1bown,t1_jb1bjne
That's not the point. They spent it without having CL money. They didn't know if CL was a possibility. But they believed in the managers and spent it. Would Levy have spent that much without getting CL?,Spurs,Yes,jazra9g,t1_jazr39z

">When City win the league again with probably their lowest points total in years.....Will that mean Arsenal hasn't had an impressive season? 

It's an odd comment because the season isn't over. You could argue Arsenal have fallen short if they lose but they would be losing to City under pep who's of the greatest managers in the world, and this is a transitional Arsenal team playing with second youngest team and manager (I think, I believe Bournemouth manager is a year younger) who aren't quite there yet from what I've seen. They wouldn't be losing their title to Leicester with a prime Kane, Deli, Erikson, Toby, Jan and son. So again, no it's not that impressive? 

>And as for the summer spending. I believe Pochs net spend was 19m a season. Which was actually less than when he was at saints. I'm not claiming he had to run it like a pauper but he punched well above his weight financially compare that to City Utd Arsenal Chelsea over that period and its crazy what he did.

Net spend means fuck all here. He still spent 400mil. He signed Tanguy, Sanchez, Aurier, Janssen, Lo Celso, Clarke, Foyth, Stamboli etc who all flopped massively and cost over 120mil 

As an expat living in France and supporting Toulouse, his tenure at PSG was entertaining for most French fans because they generally played meh but their team was insane. It was like watching Rodgers at Celtic, looked world class then average at Leicester. 

I don't think a manager has ever returned to a club at spurs level and succeeded have they? 

You'd be better going for someone new. 

I just don't like this statement that's always branded about that Poch didn't spend. Tanguy and Sanchez alone were 100mil.",Spurs,Yes,jb1xms3,t1_jb16y9k
"I'll take Pochettino especially if the other options are steve cooper and glasner... yuck. If you want 3ATB, go for Tuchel. But I'm done with it. Pochettino , De Zerbi, and Gallardo are the only choices that make sense.",Spurs,Yes,jb0vz8q,t1_jb0vhyy

We literally at the time were saying what you are saying about Arsenal ""we are a young team"" etc etc. Kane dele eriksen etc weren't prime they were all like 22/23? 

I really think you need to do some research on this because that's twice you've been glaringly wrong now. You've made a weird statement and then completely messed up your facts about it. 

Why does net spend mean fuck all? I dont understand. And I still don't understand your point on this either? We didn't sign any players for 18 months because we were putting money into the new stadium. And even then.....uts still significantly lower than the teams around us spent during that time, Arsenal included. And on top of all that you were comparing it to Arteta for some reason and then we established arteta has spent as much in half the time?

What are you talking about?",Spurs,Yes,jb239gb,t1_jb1xms3
"His response is perfectly reasonable. Honestly, I don't think you understand what it means to support a football club

You think there's no pressure?? Spurs fans boo the team off an embarrassing amount. Especially in recent seasons.

Your idea of what a football fan is is not just moronic, it's tiresome. It just disregards what football is for so many match going fans.

If you blow that up to the grander scale we see so much vitriol towards other members of the team, the board, a go-kart track, player/manager of the month awards, the manager and their staff. It reminds me a lot of Arsenal 2 or 3 years ago when their fanbase seemed like one of the most toxic going. I'm not saying gooners are saints or there aren't other teams we can draw comparison to, but you see how they get behind the team throughout games, even when losing.

"Ok I know this talk is sensitive with the fans, but here are the list of players that I think we should really attempt to sell this summer. (like we should be doing everything we can to get any money back):

Eric Dier (he won't be worth much but we gotta try)

Davinson Sanchez (should have been sold years ago, bad Hitchens signing)

Lucas Moura (probably leaving on a free hopefully)

Japhet Tanganga (I always liked him but it isn't working)

Ryan Sessegnon (I'm sorry but he has gotta go, we've seen enough, horrible Hitchens signing)

Sergio Reguilon (this one upsets me the most because he was capable of being so good but it isn't working out for him. He is also struggling at Atletico right now and is injury prone)

Hugo Lloris (I appreciate all that he has done for the club, but it is definitely time to go).

Ivan Perisic (He is old and if Conte leaves it makes no sense to keep him anymore tbh).

Harry Winks (doing well in Serie A, happy for him, I think it might suit him better than the PL's physicality and pace would)

Ndombele: (I get he is talented, but he isn't suited to the premier league. Honestly Ndombele is showing us that he isn't even suited to the italian league. Ndombele really makes the most sense in a league like Ligue 1 and thats where we should try to sell him).

Lo Celso: (Very interesting utility player, but I just don't think it is going to work out). He isn't that great at being a CAM. Not what we need right now. Makes more sense as a winger or striker than as a CAM and we don't need that right now. Should be trying to sell.",Spurs,No,jarhufs,t3_11gt10s
"Ok I'll try to be positive: I actually like how our youth (25 or under) is looking. 

Pedro Porro: Very overpriced, but I still remember how great he looked at sporting. I still am positive on him despite struggling defensively.

Djed Spence: Whether as a winger or as a wingback, Djed definitely has the talent to be good. He is like an Ndombele but I think the difference is Djed isn't lazy he just has some overconfidence/lack of concentration he needs to work on. 

Kulusevski: I don't care that he is struggling right now, we have a player in Kulu. I have no doubt he will be back in form under a new system. 

Skipp: Hasn't been world class yet, but he has shown me very encouraging signs as a DM/CM. Is already just as good as Mason Mount if not better imo. 

Bentancur: An amazing CM.Was arguably our best player earlier in the season besides Harry Kane. Great signing.

Pape Matar Sarr: I have really high hopes for him. I have been very impressed whenever he has played. I know I'm jumping the gun here but the potential is really high with this kid. (I think this guy has what it takes to be as good as Yaya toure, gerrard, or lampard). Obviously he isn't good enough yet.

Cristian Romero: I still believe he is the next Sergio Ramos. I really rate him. I hope he proves me right. 

Even players like Richarlison and Emerson have shown flashes of being good players. I still think they could turn out to be good unlike players like (Sanchez and Sessegnon)

For an upcoming Project manager, there are pieces to work with here. We just have to find the right manager. IMO: those two guys are De Zerbi or Marcelo Gallardo, but hopefully we hire the right one.

"I really don‚Äôt get why you lot keep getting your hopes up every year about our summer transfers. Every transfer window people come on here calling it a 7-8/10. Look at the hype this sub had for the summer. We brought in 6 players(plus Udogie who remained at Udinese) and none of them have been an upgrade in the starting XI. And a good amount of our staring XI was/is subpar to begin with, it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre fielding the Galacticos every week. We don‚Äôt spend enough and when we do so much of it goes to waste. 

How people still think a top 4 finish is the most important thing for us is beyond me at this point. We just got lucky with Son and Kane carrying us for the past 5-6 seasons, every other serious team would start building around them after being gifted to world class players for basically nothing, our owners saw it as a reason to actually hold off on spending.",Spurs,No,jaqhvut,t3_11gt10s
"Given our CB and FWD situations are a bit of a mess right now, I‚Äôd like us to build from our strong areas tactically next season: our midfielders (Peh, ben10, skipp, bissouma, Sarr) and our attacking wingbacks (Udogie, Porro).        
The only formation where we can maximise them is the 352.       
Good thing that it suits both Son and Richarlison better too without the defensive burden they have to take in the current 343.      
Unfortunately it means four of them will have to rotate for the front two spots but a silver lining to it is that we don‚Äôt need to sign another fwd and can focus on signing new CBs.       
Now the bad news is that even after signing 2 new CBs, we would just have 4 usable CBs when we need 3 at all times leaving us short of depth. Expecting us to sign three CBs is just impossible with this ownership.   

Here the tactical tweak I propose is to use Emerson as RCB backup in addition to RWB. If Davies can do it, so can he. Bring back Spence for additional cover.     
The lineup would looks something like this:     


||Kane/Son||Deki/Richy||

4 points behind and they have a match in hand,Spurs,Yes,jasy08c,t1_jast1dq
"Well yeah, they've trended up into their position and we've trended down. And they've looked good doing it, whereas we've looked unconvincing in even some of our wins. There's more context than you're letting on.

Sure, it's hard to say we're bad when we're in fourth, but there's a lot more going on than a snapshot in time.",Spurs,Yes,jasvrsh,t1_jast1dq
"In addition, Spurs scored more goals than United. Keep in mind United has a better squad and Conte is called a defensive manager, while Ten hag plays progressive football. When Conte took over a talented squad at Chelsea, he won the Premier League. Third most prolific team in the league plays terrorist football. People forget how bad Liverpool and Arsenal played during the first 3 years of Klopp and Arteta.",Spurs,Yes,jasvd86,t1_jast1dq
I haven't been coping,Spurs,Yes,jaq9cb2,t1_jaq94ri
"I've continued living my life because it's not that serious. We lose sometimes, we win sometimes, it doesn't always make sense. Real lost to Sheriff the year they won the CL for Christ's sake",Spurs,Yes,jar9shy,t1_jaq94ri

"We already are out of trophy contention this season. Don‚Äôt make things worse! 

I think the key thing you are missing though is one of those games is City vs Arsenal at the etihad. That‚Äôs effectively 6 points for city if they win, which I think they will. I also think Arsenal will slow down and start dropping more points. They may win the title but it will be very close and I think that game at the etihad is more important than who drops fewer points in the other games",Spurs,Yes,jarym24,t1_jaqjf0h

Another year. Another trophy-less season. Why wouldn't people be upset?,Spurs,Yes,jarcax3,t1_jaqa1wz
"Pretty much agree with you. 'Never go back to an ex' is a good adage in life and in football. Pochettino was fantastic for a certain time and with a specific type of player, namely young, hungry, inexperienced. Ones that won't put up a fuss when the boss orders them to do double training sessions, or hare down the defence in hunt of the ball. That's not the squad we have now. Kane isn't the athlete he was at 22, and asking him to press like a madman would not only be a waste of his remaining years but could potentially cause him to injure himself again. We don't have anything close to a Dembele to progress the ball. Our centre backs aren't a shadow on Jan & Toby. There are simply too many reasons why it wouldn't work and Poch has shown very little since 2018 that suggests he knows how to adapt his style of play to suit a different squad.",Spurs,Yes,jaqb4zm,t1_jaqaf8y
With our current squad it‚Äôs not a good idea at all. Fans wanting him back are looking at it through rose tinted glasses. Only way I could see a logic for him coming back is if we have a total rebuild and the board are probably against that and I don‚Äôt see that happening,Spurs,Yes,jaqasw0,t1_jaqaf8y
"Because it's cathartic, until our next loss",Spurs,Yes,jaqas9u,t1_jaqaf8y
"Genuinely love when when a comment ends with ‚Äúthoughts?‚Äù I just think it‚Äôs so funny. BUT it seems people are either leaning way into Poch coming back or way against Poch coming back. I‚Äôm personally still hoping Conte sticks around and gets his defense. 

But if he doesn‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt have any problem with Poch coming back into the fold. We know exactly what we‚Äôre getting with him. Attacking football where the players run their asses off. Which sounds great to me. It might take a year for him to implement his style tho so we would still need patience with him. 

On the other hand taking a punt on someone like Marcelo Gallardo could be a fun experiment with Ultra attacking football. The chance to fall in love with another manager and his team sounds great. I would imagine that would take a few extra years. 

So if Conte leaves I think offering Poch a 3 year contract would be great. If we go in another direction like Gallardo who is only proven in 1 minor league, give him a 5 year and let‚Äôs see what he can do. 

Thoughts?",Spurs,Yes,jaqcp3m,t1_jaqaf8y
"Because we had no squad reset. It‚Äôs pretty simple - Poch‚Äôs methods are such that every 4-5 years we need a refresh, very much in line with SAF‚Äôs policy

Over the course of the 16/17, 17/18 and 18/19 windows we only made 2 good signings in Wanyama and Sanchez(good under Poch and would‚Äôve developed him)

If our transfers are so bad that only after a 4 year cycle you start a rebuild then we‚Äôd fail every single time. No the rebuild starts one year into the cycle. Challenged for the title in 15/16 and proceeded to buy only 2 good players over the course of the next 3 years. That‚Äôs what fucked us up

But Poch is that good of a manager he somehow managed to keep us competitive irrespective of our transfer failings

So yeah, Poch isn‚Äôt that one that has to change, it‚Äôs us. Conte isn‚Äôt the one that has to change, it‚Äôs us. It‚Äôs very very rarely the manager‚Äôs fault and in our case it definitely isn‚Äôt, our recruitment has just been shite",Spurs,Yes,jaqh1p4,t1_jaqaf8y
"I'd rather have Pochettino over Conte right now, but I prefer Marcelo Gallardo, De Zerbi (i really rate him) and even Tuchel (yes Mr. ""back 3 tuchel"") over him. 

I also don't think Kane would stay under Poch.",Spurs,Yes,jarepdl,t1_jaqaf8y
"The usual suspects have been given access to the internet by their parents again so are on here spouting their incoherent ENIC Out posts.

I really only make an effort when it‚Äôs an important game like a European fixture or a big game in the league. Otherwise I only watch if I am home without Uni work because I work alternating Saturdays and Sundays so I often miss a few games every season by nature.,Spurs,Yes,jaqfg7r,t1_jaqf9wa

"Responded, I can sympathise with you with how difficult it can be to get responses for a diss questionnaire (mine was also football related). 

I have a slight criticism of your questionnaire, some of the questions allow for only one answer, where in my opinion they could be multiple choice as several answers are relevant. Your call obviously, but it might give you something to write about in the limitations section at the end of your diss - examiners and supervisors love seeing an objective look at limitations of the study",Spurs,Yes,jar6s63,t1_jar5d86

It‚Äôs shocking. People want a nicer looking balance sheet over winning the best cup competition in the world. Clearly aren‚Äôt that invested in the club.,Spurs,Yes,jaqcog1,t1_jaq9cij
"It's crazy that it's even a consideration. Arsenal and United both missed out on top 4, yet one is probably going to win the league, one already won the Carabao cup and has a good shot at the FA cup, and they both can win the Europa league. The only way their seasons don't end miles better than ours is if we somehow win the CL, which is not realistically gonna happen. 

4th place should not be a target for any ""big 6"" team. Conte is a win-now manager and got targets in pretty much every position he asked for, so he should've targeted a top 3 finish to at least improve on last season and a cup competition. Even if we didn't win the league cup or FA cup, we should've at least gone out against bigger teams, not Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United's B-teams.

"I hope people are finally realizing how crazy that is. Yes, even the fucking Carabao Cup is worth more than Top 4 finish will ever be. You see it with Arsenal, they finished 5th and they are on their way to winning the fucking league. No one will remember Kane and Son for finishing top 4, they will remember them for not winning trophies. Period, trophies matter.

None of us are analysts or scouts it‚Äôs not our job to know whether a player is actually good before they arrive just to get our hopes up only for them to be completely dashed. 

The irony is that the one good transfer window we‚Äôve had in 6 seasons (last January) most fans thought was rubbish at the time as it looked like we‚Äôd just panic bought 2 Juve rejects while thinning our depth for the run in. 

No doubt our recruitment has been terrible the last few years but you can‚Äôt blame the fans for having hope. Us being miserable or skeptical about new players ain‚Äôt gonna make ENIC any better at recruitment",Spurs,Yes,jarznqd,t1_jaqhvut
">Here the tactical tweak I propose is to use Emerson as RCB backup in addition to RWB. If Davies can do it, so can he

That is so absurd. Davies has played outside the CB role before in his early days here and for Swansea. Emerson in his professional career has never played at RCB so if you think it's bread and butter that's not going to happen anytime soon. Also being a CB requires not just excellent tackling but also good decisions and reading of the game and composure on the ball. Look at Tanganga, he can definitely put his foot in and work as a Defensive RB , but he's good piss poor decision making and awareness and thus he makes for a bad CB.",Spurs,Yes,jaurf20,t1_jarxl7e
In a word? No. Longer answer is he's 31 we won't be able to replicate his usefulness that pool had with him as a false 9 and we've got richarlison as a second striker who already doesn't get minutes why sign another forward to take up a squad slot who won't get minutes,Spurs,Yes,jar7lbw,t1_jar4yfo

"Or its because Perisic just hasn't been good.

With Son on the pitch, or off it, Perisic plays the same way and has been awful. He is in the bottom 1% of players in the PL for through balls or progressive passing.

I will say in your defense there seems to be a large representation of levy supporters on here for sure I don't know whether it's most of the subs on here though. Anyone that attempts to push against the board or the ownership is usually downvoted in some way.

"Its my opinion but, as long as Levy didn't step into the football decision, He's actually good. I don't wanna an owner like Todd, who spent shit mindlessly, can't always living to support a club with an ecstasy--a short living good times. The current football situation where's the owner are a literal country, the urge to ask the club to spend more money will of course rising.

I would say things like, if City without the Emirati, and keeping their current business model will they still relevant and be sustainable? Most of their sponsor would be gone, since its fake dodgy sponsor that the country owns them, they will actually needed a new business model as soon as the Emir gone. The wages, their fans expectation (that will always high with the money they've spend), their standard, etc. They're more tied to their owner than they even realized. I  think they're not even owns their stadium so not much other choices to makes money unless they did great on the pitch... but they can't even win the UCL, so doubt they will have a long age after the Emir gone.

But if Spurs without Levy and keeping our current business model, are we still gonna be relevant? I believe we are.

I think if ""ENIC Out"" were less divisive, annoying, and arrogant, they would do much better - if they actually found out pain points people have for the ownership - they could then focus their campaigning on those areas.

However, what actually happens is they have 1 tactic, spam the same 6 shitty ""memes"" and images they've made under every bit of Tottenham news, and if you disagree with them they call you a Levy cocksucker or something and don't engage with you. Then they wonder why communities like /r/coys pop up, where lots of people who don't agree with them, try to keep the place free of ENIC-Out shit, because everywhere else is full of it from a loud minority.",Spurs,Yes,jatd860,t1_jasv9c7
Hmmmm haven't seen it yet. Where do you read those comments?,Spurs,Yes,jaswcs2,t1_jasv9c7
Porro played better in his two games *against* Spurs this season than Emerson did in his first 18 months at the club. Give him time for God's sake.,Spurs,Yes,jaqik2z,t1_jaqg3xo
"I think he's gonna come good. He got clattered a few times in the Sheffield game and got straight back up, kept making his runs, kept trying. It's not clicking immediately and he needs some time to adapt to the system but I definitely got hopes for the lad.",Spurs,Yes,jaqhov0,t1_jaqg3xo

"Real Madrid absolutely do not play the same type of football as us. Our system is positionally rigid and based on automations, Real Madrid‚Äôs system relies on fluidity and overloading different areas of the pitch in a more situational system, strongly based on technical combinations in and around the box",Spurs,Yes,jar22ri,t1_jar0fhw
"We don't even play that counter attacking one touch football, we pass around the box shoot from distance, either hope for a deflection, a miracle or a corner which is the only thing we are good at. Oh and a harry kane brilliance too.",Spurs,Yes,jar21n0,t1_jar0fhw
"Today, playing without the ball is not enough to achieve great things. The lower teams are at a high enough level that they can break us down if we sit back for 90 minutes. It‚Äôs what we was under Mourinho, we tried to win every game 1-0, and in the early 2000s that worked but nowadays even Fulham and Wolves are good enough to punish you if that‚Äôs your game plan. It‚Äôs kind of what we‚Äôre seeing with Conte as well

Possession based football works much better nowadays, in so many ways. Results wise, to name one. I really really hope we get a more possession oriented manager in the summer",Spurs,Yes,jar1gs2,t1_jar0fhw
"But we aren't a good counter attacking team. If we had a semblance of good counter attacking football like early mou days along with being good with ball at feet I would've agreed with you. But in reality, we don't counter attack well neither do we don't control possession well. When we have ball possession we're passing amongst the centrebacks and when we counter our best hope is a corner and some giani vio magic.",Spurs,Yes,jarrkxf,t1_jar0fhw

Conte‚Äôs fossil football is testing a lot of fans and he is a mercenary, nobody expects him to stay long term because he is a short term manager. Also unless you are ready to spend around 350m on 28-33 year olds, he‚Äôs a terrible manager to rely on a successful rebuild.",Spurs,Yes,jarfkkv,t1_jaree5w

"I thinking saying we NEED a rebuild is extreme. Our midfield is strong going forward. Bentancur, Skipp, Sarr. 
Emerson looks great and if he keeps form is a great option at RWB or potentially RB. Porro has promise. Spence, Romero, Kane. (if he stays, which we should want)
We lack depth, and lack CB‚Äôs. A cup match and we bring on Sanchez? That is dreadful.

I think what I'm getting at is maybe something to do with the psychological side of being a fan and the impact it can directly or indirectly have on a sports team and at what point could it turn from what it is now into something that offers up much more. Emerson dug himself out and I'd like to think we wouldn't explode on him if he put a couple of 5/10 performances in but maybe that's naive.

"I think this is overstated, all teams struggle to break down good low block teams. We put 2 past west ham and they have one of the best defensive records in the league. Southampton played like a 5-4-1 on the first day of the system and we pumped them. Newcastle beat us, but we still managed to put one past them, and besides the foul of Lloris it really should have ended a tie. They have by far the best defence in the league, and it was actually broken by the much-maligned Lenglet. The guy is really good at crossing from deep in the half-space, we've got a few goals off that.

I could go on, but generally this season low blocks haven't been our problem. Our problem has been individual errors ruining our good efforts elsewhere. We need more confidence in our backline, and better players in there, asap.",Spurs,Yes,jaqyo5s,t1_jaqwf0d

"Winning a League Cup or FA Cup at the expense of Top 4 costs us something like 40m. That's a CB, that's a GK, that's a CAM...the sad reality that Spurs fans don't seem to want to accept is that this side is not of the quality to win a trophy. You don't get there without continually qualifying for the CL and getting the resources to bolster your squad. People ask why we keep playing the same XI and not rotating, then we rotate heavily and get embarrassed. We are in the long-overdue rebuilding period. Top 4 this season (and probably next season) is more than sufficient for this squad while we rotate out the bad eggs and get in better players. The rebuild is stalled if we don't qualify for the CL.",Spurs,Yes,jarhgvn,t1_jaraext

"And how come almost none of these players are at the club anymore? They keep spending on quantity over quality, buying young players for 10-20m trying to increase their value. Sarr, Gil, Sess, Udogie,Spence, Rodon etc. making us look like a shit Dortmund because it hasn‚Äôt worked once apart from us breaking even on Bergwijn. We have had about 3 ‚Äúbig‚Äù transfers in the past 4 years, two of which came of the back of that huge sum accumulated through our 2018/19 CL run. Other than that this club is allergic of spending over 25m on a player. Serious clubs are consistently spending 40-60m on seasoned players in their prime (26-28 yo), something you won‚Äôt see under this ownership I promise you.

We had the best chance last summer to finally take the next step, yet what do we do? Get to veterans in the twilight of their career on a free, get one CB in on a dry loan who has been a meme for about 2 years, 2 youngsters for small sums (Spence, Udogie), a decent player for 23m who was in the last year of his contract and one actual big money signing, who plays in the two positions we actually have WC players in.

Not bothered until they get a new manager,Spurs,Yes,jauo5ig,t1_jatwqtx
">Look at the amount clubs like Spammers, Forrest, Fullham we‚Äôre spending last summer

Yeah and look at QPR, Sunderland, Leeds 10-12 years ago that did the same thing, they spent far above their means, just like the 3 teams you've mentioned.

They failed to break into the 'big time' and their teams all collapsed under the weight of their expenditures and ended up in League 1 because of it.

&#x200B;

WHam probably dont have that issue because begrudgingly they're a big enough team with enough of a following that they can sustain in the championship to come back up.

If Notts Forest get relegated this year, they're in a shit ton of trouble in the championship, a huge amount of players on massive contracts that they wont be able to afford to keep paying. Either contracts will be ripped up or players sold for cheap. 

&#x200B;

Also, i could understand the animosity towards Levy 2-3 years ago but the last 2 years? The guy has spent over ¬£300M on Conte so far, we've even spent some of Levys/Lewis own money, something thats never happened before.

He deserves criticism for hiding from the fans and not giving us a coherent plan moving forward but the spending is way up.",Spurs,Yes,jaqlciy,t1_jaqczmy

"Definition of productive in the Cambridge dictionary: 

*Resulting in or providing a large amount or supply of something*

As in Lucas was our most productive in providing any semblance of a chance / goal / assist. I know the score but a player can be productive or creative without directly scoring or assisting hence my previous comment.

There was no need for the rudeness in your previous comment, as for Danjuma I don‚Äôt disagree that maybe he should‚Äôve started instead but at the same time it‚Äôs evident we‚Äôre not seriously looking to activate that buy clause so neither of them are going to be here next season, Danjuma or not we should‚Äôve beaten Sheffield fucking United. I just don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôre going after Lucas as if he was the sole cause of the result.

Edit: oh you‚Äôre American that explains it sorry.",Spurs,Yes,jas9zfk,t1_jas8mcx
It‚Äôs *miles* better,Spurs,Yes,jarh5xx,t1_jara4s2
"It‚Äôs not as bad, but we‚Äôre slowly getting there",Spurs,Yes,jarczaz,t1_jara4s2
Lol he really does,Spurs,Yes,jarwt66,t1_jarluz7
"then I'd say Dier. He does shithousery too, sometimes makes dumb mistakes (which are both funny and painful) and he has a bunch of memes like Arguing with the fans or using the rest room during that cup match against Chelsea lol.",Spurs,Yes,jarl5qh,t1_jarkdde
"Oh yes, I love the great memories. Like losing to Zagreb, losing to Sheffield, losing to Colchester, losing the Champions League final to Liverpool, losing to City while being managed by Mason. Great memories lad. Ironically, the most fun I've had as a spurs fan were when we were top of the league under Jose. We beat old trafford 6-1, and Arsenal were near relegation. Those were good times, but those shouldn't be our best memories. We should be winning a Carabao cup at least. I still remember us sacking Jose right before the cup final and it still hurts me. Trust me, you can't tell me you are a spurs fan if you haven't suffered more pain than happiness and thats facts.",Spurs,Yes,jarktbx,t1_jarj3kt
"Agree, the dude is a warrior and I always saw him as more a Ben Davies type for the team, strong team guy that works hard but is a rotation player. And I know Davies has been great recently, he has had stretches in the past where he‚Äôs stepped up but so has Dier. But IMO they‚Äôre not title winner caliber in their positions but would be great bench guys for their leadership and dedication to the team",Spurs,Yes,jauxjlo,t1_jau5c35
Most heartwarming r/coys interaction,Spurs,Yes,jaqvehm,t1_jaqv1jr
We're winning the CL anyway so it doesn't matter,Spurs,Yes,jarft6u,t1_jardn31
"Ignore him mate, I'm excited for us to get top 4 as well. Right now, that's our ""par"" and our foundation to continue growing. Winning a trophy will be so good when it comes, but it comes off the back of consistent European football.

We spent 3 seasons out of UCL, finally got back in, and our entitled fanbase suddenly hate the competition and don't care about being part of it. We spent the end of last season, and the start of this one, singing ""Oh what a night"" and apparently nobody cares anymore lol.",Spurs,Yes,jaqvfgk,t1_jaquphv
"It does help morale a fuck ton, both fand and team.",Spurs,Yes,jarbmog,t1_jarbbm6
"When the grand scheme of things is to build real estate, obviously a Top 4 helps more.",Spurs,Yes,jarlado,t1_jarbbm6
"> You don't get there without continually qualifying for the CL and getting the resources to bolster your squad.    
  
That's the theory how it should be but that's not how it plays out. Qualify regularly and all you get is funds diverted to build a stadium and a transfer window blankout. Rebuild a little to qualify again and the money gets used up to build a mario kart racing track instead of buying new CBs. Once that is done, regular Top 4 money will be used for another real estate project. This ownership does not want to go beyond Top 4.",Spurs,Yes,jarkkzw,t1_jarhgvn
"Hi Daniel Levy, nice to meet you",Spurs,Yes,jau36au,t1_jatim2j
"Lol, I love the tendency some people have to urge calmness in the face of all defeats. It‚Äôs one thing to take positives, it‚Äôs another thing to accept defeat is part of sports fandom and it‚Äôs of course incredibly important to not let your mental health get derailed by a football team.  but it‚Äôs so weird/annoying the number of people who want to say that we as fans are too inconsistent and get too mad about losing when we‚Äôre happy about winning. What are you here for if you‚Äôre not emotionally invested enough to care when we lose!? I hate the term virtue signalling but I think this is like a weird form id call apathy signalling",Spurs,Yes,jas3arr,t1_jari1ql
"Statistically, yes. Is it likely? No.

But you can't reduce Football like you have in your OP. Arsenal have hit a rough patch of form, which City of previous seasons would have capitalised on.

You can't use previous winrates to predict the rest of the season, because form, injuries, and tactical changes can have a large impact on things.",Spurs,Yes,jaqlz8p,t1_jaqkv1l
"It does matter though cos probably does not equal will. 

If city beat Arsenal at the etihad then they have 3 more points they can afford to drop in other games, while Arsenal have 3 less points they can afford to drop, that‚Äôs not true of any other remaining game for either side",Spurs,Yes,jas12wa,t1_jas07sy
"Maybe. It just reminds me of Brexit if I'm honest, people have got the bogeyman in their head and that's it - their mind is made. I've tried to listen to arguments for ENIC out and none of them have gotten anywhere close to convincing me.

When I walk past the protest (that has always been there) and it has more than half a dozen attendees I might take note. Until then all I'll do is continue to point out the incoherency of their arguments - which is nice and easy :)",Spurs,Yes,jar5rwo,t1_jar1o9j
Erm no these were credible publications. I think it‚Äôs more so disgruntled players leaking to the press when things have gone awry,Spurs,Yes,jas7fws,t1_jas7465
I didn‚Äôt remember it exactly right and it was 2 months ago tbf (and a shit source lmao) but [this is what I was thinking of](https://twitter.com/thespursweb/status/1610604990006968322?s=46&t=_ju_3QExfSqlQjGX0_dkVg),Spurs,Yes,jas1tnd,t1_jas1aat
"To be honest ... My dad watches the cricket on sky as well. And I watch Italian football on BT. 

Prime is the one which feels less value these days... Deliveries are shit now.",Spurs,Yes,javy39q,t1_jas71uc
"I guess that's right especially now with clubs having basically unlimited money, just a shame. I look at Liverpool and see the blueprint though and part of that is managerial/team culture consistency. Even worse considering weve had the likes of Kane, son, lloris, and not even on insane wages compared to some other players",Spurs,Yes,jarxgor,t1_jarnun6
"> Investment required to go from a Top 4 squad to a trophy challenging squad is more than the revenue increase from actually winning that trophy vs a Top 4

That doesn't make any sense. A team that can challenge for top 4 will be able to challenge for trophies.",Spurs,Yes,jary4ns,t1_jarnun6
Why wouldn't they sell then?  Given they take nothing out of the club.,Spurs,Yes,jarsnji,t1_jarkctz
"agreed. They say they want to make cheap signings and be like Brighton but they can't get deals like Kim Min Jae, Grealish, or Khvicha over the line. People still aren't even talking about that. ENIC just don't have a vision.",Spurs,Yes,jark22h,t1_jarj0i5
What are you talking about? Tons of posts and comments on here in the last few days blaming ENIC. Plenty of them coming from me. I wanna know why that doesn‚Äôt count as people being up in arms?,Spurs,Yes,jas1k51,t1_jas192t
"He'd  be good but just saw a report Chelsea might be paying his release clause.   
Conte or not next season I hope we switch to a back 4.",Spurs,Yes,jawc4bd,t1_jatc3at
"That‚Äôs the other point. For the past 4 years especially, when we have spent money, 90% of it goes to flops. That‚Äôs the reason I don‚Äôt care about top 4 this season, last summer it felt like the perfect time to kick on, they didn‚Äôt bring in a single fucking upgrade.",Spurs,Yes,jaqgclc,t1_jaqfz27
"I mean, probably better for you to fuck off. I'm still supporting the team whereas you're just whinging and crying about how players should leave and weaken the team. If all you do is bitch and moan you're hardly enjoying it so you should find something better to do with your time.",Spurs,Yes,jatgc0n,t1_jat4gvf
"Need to see more from him, before I would make judgement. Even a win with Germany at the Euros wont convince me because international football is different.",Spurs,Yes,jarojnj,t1_jarny3y
"Davies is not the issue. Wanna see him remain. Sanchez needa fuck off, and so does Dier tbh even tho i know he gives us his all. Davies aint a starter tho but great depth and squad player.",Spurs,Yes,jaqh17g,t1_jaqg5il
"Ben Davies is literally a better LB than the current top of the tables pair, the problem with our defence is Dier when your centre CB is a donkey its make the whole back line look worse, look at how many times Davies had to make big clearances against West ham because Dier went AWOL",Spurs,Yes,jaqgnmv,t1_jaqg5il
No. I do not owe this stupidity a discussion.,Spurs,Yes,jat3aoy,t1_jaszrmm
"Reminds me of the stupid republican democrat i keep seeing from americans, idk how u could sound nore illiterate tbh",Spurs,Yes,jausf34,t1_jatdebf
The ENIC out boomers on Twitter and Spurs Community are not the same people here lmao,Spurs,Yes,jatixzo,t1_jatdebf
"You are free to express your opinion here or anywhere for that matter I'm not on Twitter but I know on Youtube Levy In supporters are actively encouraged to come out of the woodwork to show their faces and put voices to their debates that further the debate this is why Youtube as a platform is much superior to Reddit because right now it feels much more impartial and fans from different spectrums are allowed to air their views without being brigaded, bullied and mass downvoted and a number of them do with solid and rational debates but for some odd reason still many of them choose to remain in the shadows and unknown. It's only on Reddit for some reason where the debate isn't being had honestly, bullying, brigading and mass downvoting is a big thing on Reddit for some reason and this is why this sub reddit is actually far less meaningful. 

I don't believe calling people stupid, wankers, brigading and mass downvoting is shutting anything down you merely stifle the debate and kick the can down the road you don't defeat it in any way shape, or form. I also don't see why people on here struggle to have an honest debate on our ownership without strawman debates, insults, and clear aggression.",Spurs,Yes,jatmbll,t1_jatdebf
"I'm genuinely questioning that myself, legit don't understand why we keeping them. But, looks, its only been a year since we got a legit DoF, someone who we can trust with the football decision, after Levy handling them himself for years.

Oh I see sorry. So you‚Äôve come up with this ‚Äúprophecy‚Äù based on two showings?,Spurs,Yes,jaqjlub,t1_jaqg6td
If you put those players into our system we wouldn‚Äôt suddenly play the same as they do. The systems are entirely different,Spurs,Yes,jar7oms,t1_jar7lg7
Even worse y'all,Spurs,Yes,jaqxh3x,t1_jaquf70
That doesn‚Äôt make him bigger than the club because their peaks aren‚Äôt the same nor are their records. And Son doesn‚Äôt even come close to Kane consistency wise,Spurs,Yes,jaqvlq5,t1_jaquh8w
"yes, 1,000%

harry is the best thing to happen to this club in the last half century. why in the fuck would someone want to see him leave for the sake of replacing one manager that isn't thriving with another manager who isn't going to thrive",Spurs,Yes,jarmt22,t1_jarjw8m
">I get it, you want to keep both Conte and Kane

I defo want to keep Kane, not really bothered about keeping Conte in all honesty",Spurs,Yes,jarg156,t1_jarf9dl
Considering our last trophy was a league cup I don‚Äôt really think you can be picky like that anyway,Spurs,Yes,jaqz6sw,t1_jaqz3vp
"I do agree it's ridiculous to even talk about the FA Cup in the same breath as the Caravan Cup. 

But I personally don't see it as a Jekyll trophy any more. It's the same top clubs competiting for it as at the FA cup. I would love to win a league cup at this point.",Spurs,Yes,jar38p6,t1_jaqz3vp
Bore off no one has forced him to stay,Spurs,Yes,jar1sb2,t1_jar0dde
"We are Tottenham fans, not Harry Kane fans. I hope with every fiber he stays and becomes a Premier League legend in his own right. He'd be regarded as untouchable amongst our fanbase. 

If he does go then that's fine. But the day he leaves is the day I stop rooting for or caring about him.",Spurs,Yes,jar5ga7,t1_jar0dde
"it's not a vacuum. 

not starting richarlison would have been daft. Son.. ....debatable. 

but the decision to start a player who has been been more useless than not for the last 2 years and is running out of contract over a young exciting player that just scored on their debut is factually a bad decision. 

but yes. moura shouldn't be criticized personally.",Spurs,Yes,jasj7dt,t1_jashbf3
I violated my rule of going on Twitter and Reddit after Wednesday‚Äôs loss‚Ä¶both are so toxic after a loss.,Spurs,Yes,jarfnjc,t1_jarczaz
"you seem genuinely miserable with only a recent experience of supporting this club from thousands of miles away, and probably shouldn't be speaking for those of us that grew up supporting this club. 

again, plenty of great memories and not going to let losses crumble them",Spurs,Yes,jarn96o,t1_jarktbx
"This woe is me, Spurs suck attitude is so pathetic. Y'all don't think the players can feel that energy? Everyday before the Sheffield match it's Dr. Tottenham this, I've seen this one before.",Spurs,Yes,jarna35,t1_jarktbx
"You must be a new fan then. Many worse memories than those you just mentioned (other than champions league loss obviously). Also many better memories than what you mentioned. Supporting tottenham comes with a lot of misery, but that makes the good moments even greater. What about beating chelsea at stamford bridge or beating man u at old trafford for the first time after 20 odd years. These may not be as grand of an achievement as some other big clubs but for me they are incredible memories as a fan.",Spurs,Yes,jarnpkd,t1_jarktbx
Hahahhaha,Spurs,Yes,jaqvk05,t1_jaqvehm
"Alright I see what you are doing. LFG! 

Hey Arsenal, Champions of Europe you'll never sing that! Yessir!! Lets Go!",Spurs,Yes,jarggwg,t1_jarft6u

[deleted],Spurs,Yes,jas462y,t1_jas12wa
Tbf I completely agree with that bogeyman mentality and it‚Äôs not something just isolated to Spurs but seems to have manifested itself in politics (not just UK) in the past decade. It‚Äôs sad that it‚Äôs such a struggle nowadays to have a coherent debate with someone when its so much easier to be noisy and angry.,Spurs,Yes,jar7iga,t1_jar5rwo
I'm not saying they weren't credible publications. Just that it's something that happens every time a manager is on their way out.,Spurs,Yes,jas7n2n,t1_jas7fws
"To compete for FA/EFL cups, you need squad depth more than a first team. And to compete for PL/CL, a  Top 4 team is not good enough.   
For both cases, investment outwieghs the reward.",Spurs,Yes,jaryog7,t1_jary4ns
"It's obvious isn't it? They haven't gotten an offer that meets their valuation of the club

In the meantime they can just scoop up record profits and keep raising their compensation while adding low-cost improvements that raise the eventual sale price

Win-win situation for them",Spurs,Yes,jart0t1,t1_jarsnji
"People talk about it all day, every day on here.",Spurs,Yes,jarsr6b,t1_jark22h
"I couldn't even care less if he got sacked by Germany, international football doesn't do anything for me. Flick was absolutely amazing at Bayern and he was decent at Hoffenheim as well.",Spurs,Yes,jarous5,t1_jarojnj
"That is my point about Davies. He‚Äôs fine on the squad, but as mainly a bench piece. Any team with ambition would have upgraded and moved him to the bench long ago, but not ENIC.",Spurs,Yes,jaqh9ee,t1_jaqh17g
"Delusional. Davies is a bench talent. Period. Full Stop.

Edit: I see why your a Davies fanboy, you can‚Äôt remotely look at him objectively, so there is no point to discussing this further.",Spurs,Yes,jaqhbl0,t1_jaqgnmv
Okay,Spurs,No,jat3oup,t1_jat3aoy
"On some level I do find this ENIC-Out situation interesting if you look at it politically. I was trying to explain to my Uncle whom I attend games with how many parallels there are between ENIC-Out groups and real life political groups, I don't think he was half as interested in the theory as me lol.",Spurs,Yes,javlt1z,t1_jausf34
Yes. It's more of a sort of cold shot kind of thing. Like if I was a betting man I'd put money on it. But I'm not so instead i make snarky comments in the daily discussion thread,Spurs,Yes,jaqk0uf,t1_jaqjlub
We play system with the players we have at best the way we could play. Conte has said this multiple times. Madrid has players who play with addition of creativity in their system. Ancelloti gives them lot of freedom the way they want to play. Conte dont give that freedom because our defenders arent capable to manage if sudden counter attack happens.,Spurs,Yes,jar8z7e,t1_jar7oms
"Yeah, yeah, you hate Son, we know. Give it up already.",Spurs,Yes,jar937y,t1_jaqvlq5
"Would you be willing to bring Tuchel in if it meant bringing Kane in? 

I definitely would, but it seems like some fans don't. 

I just realized thought that Hansi Flick is a really intriguing option",Spurs,Yes,jarn2eb,t1_jarmt22
"If you want to keep Kane, would you be willing to hire a guy like Tuchel if it meant Kane stays? (you already know my answer). I get he is ex-chelsea and all of that, but it would be different under tuchel.",Spurs,Yes,jargmxb,t1_jarg156
"It‚Äôs a competition I don‚Äôt think should exist in the first place, would feel anticlimactic if that‚Äôs how we end it",Spurs,Yes,jaqzi4j,t1_jaqz6sw
"It feels weird for people to write it off when its the last trophy we won, should we write off 2008 as well in that case? And say our actual trophy drought goes as far back as 90/91 lmao",Spurs,Yes,jar50do,t1_jar38p6
He is already a PL legend,Spurs,Yes,jar9rsm,t1_jar5ga7
"I actually get what you are saying, but it is about expectations for me. If Kane and Son are staying, I expect us to be competing for trophies. I get it though, it is much more fun when your expectations are lower. I think I'd feel better about that if we would just rebuild already. I became a fan like 2 years before Poch was hired so I guess you can say I am very lucky, but I have seen how much a rebuild can improve a fans morale as well as the club. I want to be back in that time again. This era where we should be winning trophies and winning fuck all really isn't giving me much to be excited about. That old trafford win and stamford bridge win was definitely glorious though. I'll give you that.",Spurs,Yes,jarojfg,t1_jarnpkd
"I'd say it's very close though, I'd probably put it at 40/60 in gooner's favour, but Arsenal have already shown signs of cracking. Hope those cracks continue to grow.",Spurs,Yes,jaqoms7,t1_jaqmd6s
"But City can rely on that outcome from just one result in the weekend of the etihad game - a result they can control. Every other weekend they have to rely on 2 results to yield the same points outcome and only be able to control 50% of those results.

Of course nobody can know what will happen I just question your certainty that Arsenal going 10-0-3 is the most likely probability",Spurs,Yes,jas4w3q,t1_jas462y
"Yeah, it's sad really. And when it comes to this sort of thing, it's always easier to dissent than stick to the status quo - at least online.

Ultimately, I just want whatever is best for the club ENIC in or Out, but feel in order to counterbalance the hate that's thrown towards them, there needs to be a similar response the other way. 

I don't really want to spend my time defending a billionaire and his minion, but I also don't think it's fair to assume that you need to be ENIC Out to want the club to succeed.",Spurs,Yes,jar99c7,t1_jar7iga
But what I‚Äôm trying to say is these pieces by these publications would have sources aka leaks,Spurs,Yes,jas7r3m,t1_jas7n2n
"> To compete for FA/EFL cups, you need squad depth more than a first team.

No you don't. Arsenal won multiple FA cups with team that was barely top four level and not much depth. Leicester won an FA cup with no real depth either.",Spurs,Yes,jarz1gi,t1_jaryog7
"We make a loss every year, and they have never taken any money out of the club except Levy's salary which he worlds full time for.

By comparison the Glazers have taken ¬£1.64bn out of United directly into their pockets.

I am more than up for debating the leadership but ignorant fact-free comments like this don't exactly make your case.

I really want to know what the ENIC-out brigade are saying we should have down, and how we would have paid for it.",Spurs,Yes,jarx377,t1_jart0t1
"Well, cant disagree, but i think u need to give him crsdit this season. He geniunelt was good at lwb. Dont wanna see him start next season tho, or wanna see him alternating with udogie and used as a back up lcb as well",Spurs,Yes,jaqtbcq,t1_jaqh9ee
a 'bench piece'?,Spurs,Yes,jaqqnxj,t1_jaqh9ee
"Why I'm a Davies fan boy? Because I'm welsh? You're deluded not me, ull agree he ain't suited for centre back I think he's too small and lacks strength but the season he was at his best under poch he played on the left he's played on the left twice and contributed, so wipe the tears from your eyes and watch a game without blinkers on",Spurs,Yes,jaqi4mo,t1_jaqhbl0
Doesn‚Äôt look like you‚Äôre discussing it anyway tbh,Spurs,Yes,jaqrm0y,t1_jaqhbl0
I definitely notice it each time.  Parallels are unreal between enic out and conservatives in America.,Spurs,Yes,javmk00,t1_javlt1z
"We play the system Conte has trained the players to play. Your original point was that we play the same type of football as Real Madrid do under Ancelotti, which isn‚Äôt remotely true",Spurs,Yes,jar9611,t1_jar8z7e
"I don‚Äôt? I hate how he plays in this system yeah.

Regardless, how exactly can you agree about Son being held in the same breath as Kane with respect to Spurs? They are light years apart",Spurs,Yes,jar9cbv,t1_jar937y
"Tough question tbh if it is with the assumption that Kane only stays if Tuchel comes in. Tuchel is nowhere near the top of my list for who I want to come in, but seeing Kane leave would be the most painful exit since Bale left for me",Spurs,Yes,jargxz8,t1_jargmxb
"No Tuchel, no more Chelsea rejects! I‚Äôm tired of sloppy seconds. Rather take a punt on another manager. We should pay over the top and get Zidane. Or maybe if Klopp gets sacked we can convince him to come.",Spurs,Yes,jarja7y,t1_jargmxb
We've had good enoguh teams over the last 6 or 7 years to have won something which I think is why it's so baffling that we haven't. I completely agree with what you said about poch and the morale with the fans. The feeling of hope and believing that we were truly building something special with poch is something I hope we can get again soon. I think most fans just want to see us play attractive attacking football again which is something we haven't had for a few years now. Feels like there's not much to be excited over even with champions league. But football can be unpredictable and I do belive our time will come soon,Spurs,Yes,jarqiyz,t1_jarojfg
[deleted],Spurs,Yes,jas6691,t1_jas4w3q
"I want ENIC Out of their arses and In with a fucking plan and vision for the club that‚Äôs not go-karts

If they could present some semblance of a plan I‚Äôd be backing them to the hilt but how long can the aimless lurching from manager to manager in the hopes they can fix the entirety of the football side of the ‚Äúentertainment franchise‚Äù that Tottenham Hotspur have become go on? What are they even doing up there in their little glass holes?",Spurs,Yes,jarhrdu,t1_jar99c7
"Yeah, which happens every time, there are always some unhappy players in every squad",Spurs,Yes,jas7wa2,t1_jas7r3m
Forest for the trees stuff really,Spurs,Yes,jarxl67,t1_jarx377
"Not just America, but wherever you might be living. It's interesting how difficult it is to argue in favour of the status quo, because the side of change can always say ""X is bad, let's just make it better."" ""we'll fix that."" they can always fix anything in theory.

I think Brexit makes an interesting comparison to ENIC-Out. But generalyl this is the state of political discourse globally. Us Vs. Them instead of working together on a compromise. (At least, in my view)",Spurs,Yes,javpuqq,t1_javmk00
"Son has been better in the champions league historically compared to Kane. Because Poch started Kane over Lucas, we bottled the final. We should have just stuck with the lineup. that was poch's worst mistake. 

either ways I get what you are saying. kane means more to spurs, but in terms of legacy, but of them haven't won shit, so they are being spoken in the same breath. In terms of talent, Kane is better. There is an argument that Son is definitely more clutch.",Spurs,Yes,jardkhi,t1_jar9cbv
"who would be on the top of the list (without considering Kane leaving or not)? We can include Conte staying as a possibility if you want. 

Although, I will say (I don't think Kane stays if Poch comes back and I do think him staying would be heavily dependent on the manager)",Spurs,Yes,jari7hu,t1_jargxz8
"Zidane and Klopp are unlikely to leave their clubs or join spurs. Zidane wants PSG or france, and Klopp probably wants the Germany NT job. I agree though, if you don't want sloppy seconds, we should go after managers like De Zerbi or Gallardo. (I really like Gallardo).",Spurs,Yes,jarluac,t1_jarja7y
"I really like and appreciate your optimism, but I'm not sure. Right now it seems like to me that Arsenal and United will be on top of the league every year again, and we are just back in the early 2000s. Maybe if we go back to building something special like we did under Pochettino, what you are saying is possible, but I'm really worried man.",Spurs,Yes,jarr8qd,t1_jarqiyz
Because if they control that outcome to a win that takes away 3 points Arsenal can drop elsewhere and thus put even more pressure on them to win elsewhere,Spurs,Yes,jas6g1r,t1_jas6691
"That's very fair

Something is missing, there's no doubt. Whether that could be recaptured with \#Pochback I'm not too sure, but there must be some way to make the football more fun to watch.

Perhaps my annoyance lies more with those who'd rather we become a sportswashing front, than those who feel that we could set a better path with more ambitious ownership. The options for how we do that sustainably without feeling too morally bereft are few and far between, but if something comes along that fits the bill then I'd be very happy to get ENIC Out of Spurs.",Spurs,Yes,jarnri7,t1_jarhrdu
"Ehh we‚Äôll see if it happens with Antonio, I‚Äôm adamant the Jose / Poch leaker has left the club.",Spurs,Yes,jas840a,t1_jas7wa2
Yeah I am not American but I am just exposed alot to it online haha. The polarization is a common phenomena yeah,Spurs,Yes,javqbdk,t1_javpuqq
"Honestly I don‚Äôt have a definite list, I just want a manager who gives the fans something to get behind. Somewhat like Conte was last season where his personality was infectious and it felt like we were actually moving in a forward direction. Obviously I‚Äôd like a manager that played front-foot, attacking football, and managers such as De Zerbi and Gallardo are the flavours of the month and would at least offer entertaining football. 

If Conte could get back to seeming fully involved in the project and showed some kind of desire to stay, and dropped the ‚ÄòI‚Äôm doing a small team a favour‚Äô type of attitude, I would be fine with that (mainly because chopping and changing managers so frequently is tiring and nowhere near ideal).

I also agree that I think Kane would leave if Poch came back",Spurs,Yes,jarjjtt,t1_jari7hu

"I am in total agreeance, I just want someone who knows what they want and how to get there in a footballing sense. 

ENIC very good at financial planning and execution but totally incapable of applying the same paradigm to football. It's extremely strange. They are clearly smart enough to have a goal and put together the means to accomplish it when it comes to finance. When it comes to football they're reactionary and emotional and have absolutely no clue what to do, hoping managers will just handle all the tricky bits that they don't want to do.",Spurs,Yes,jars2pp,t1_jarnri7

"I don't think Conte wants to stay at Spurs. So we should just let him go. Unironically Tuchel grew up to be a Spurs fans (or at least ""rooted"" for them when he was a child).

"Yes and it‚Äôs a game where they can deny Arsenal 3 points themselves, rather than hoping other teams do it. That massively changes the playing field from a scenario where they‚Äôve already played each other twice and Arsenal have to go 10-0-3, even though it‚Äôs the same number of games and points available in both universes. 

That Forest game was also an aberration. In the first half of this season when city dropped points it‚Äôs cos they played badly and deserved to lose. They deserved to win against forest and outplayed them but got unlucky. In the last few games city‚Äôs performances have hugely improved and they‚Äôve looked again like the team who went on mad multi-game winning runs to claim previous titles",Spurs,Yes,jas9frg,t1_jas83wz
Tuchel‚Äôs reputation definitely took a bit of a hit while being at Chelsea (despite winning the CL lmao) but Chelsea are a hierarchical mess atm.

"I feel you. I'm just worried Kane won't stay unless we bring in a top manager. Like I think he leaves if we bring in Poch, or even De Zerbi or Luis Enrique, etc. He might be willing to stay under Gallardo but there is also a risk there but it might be a shout. Klopp and Zidane aren't leaving either. If we are able to poach Spalleti, I think Kane would stay though, but thats even kind of a pipe dream although I still want to believe. Hansi Flick is someone I just thought of who I think would be worth a GREAT shout.",Spurs,Yes,jarm72e,t1_jarksuv

Our best chance to win a cup this season and yet again, they've blown it. To a championship side that played its b team.

Fucking Wrexham gave them more of a headache than that. Now, looking at the draw, we would have been up against bloody blackburn. What a great chance to win a trophy thrown away once again.

Half the team isn't good enough. Conte isn't good enough. How tf did we spend more than the runners over the course of this season and end up so far behind them? This side simply doesn't care enough to win otherwise they'd have grabbed something like even a carabao cup by now. You can say Man u got an easy draw or whatever to win the cup but we were eliminated by fucking NOTTINGHAM FOREST that, may I remind everyone, united thrashed comfortably.

So what do we do....we put out a second string team full of players who have barely played and/or we know aren't good enough. We start slow so that the crowd gets into the game, and then they sense an opportunity so bring on their actually good players who are capable of making a chance like the one they scored. 

In terms of game management it was absolutely insane.

Dumitrescu ¬£2.6m, Popescu ¬£2.9m, Armstrong ¬£4.5m, Ferdinand ¬£6m, Rebrov ¬£11m, Bent ¬£16.5m, Paulinho ¬£17m, Soldado ¬£26m, Sissoko ¬£30m, Sanchez ¬£42m, Ndombele ¬£55m.

What a truly depressing list. Even Les Ferdinand - who's generally remembered fondly - was injury plagued and only scored 12 goals in his first 3 seasons.

Our overall record transfer list looks no better - many would say it looks even worse (especially with Richarlison's current struggles)

* the amount of times I yelled ""What is he doing???"" at Sanchez last night was insane.

* I don't understand the people that ramble about CL money all the time. It's like they pocket that money themselves... What's the point of qualifying for the CL just for the sake of the money? So we can attract better players? Where are these better players? Almost all of our recent(4-5-6 years) signings lost 75% of their value the moment they stepped foot on a field for us. Our transfers have been fucking awful. Or do we want CL so desperately so we can barely escape a group stage consisting of Eintracht Frankfurt, Marseille and Sporting, or because Inter couldn't beat PSV at home, or flat out fail to get out of a group consisting of Monaco, Bayer Leverkusen and CSKA Moscow? I guess it's better than losing to Rennes, Vitesse and whoever the fuck else we played. Holy shit, Mura was it???

* It's been 4 years since I last truly enjoyed watching us play football, apart from 1 of the last Poch games where we were leading I think Palace at home 3-0 after 20-something minutes, I actually cried with joy then because I thought we were back... and apart from the Mou spell at the beginning, until West Ham. It's been 4 years of absolutely dreadful football. I used to regularly watch Spurs games with my dad, he's not a big football fan, but I was happy when I could show him how attractively my club played and we could spend time together. We've watched barely anything these past 4 years because I don't want to burden him with the absolute dross on display game after game, and with my sour mood either.

* I was in a really really dark place up until like 5-6 years ago, and Spurs were genuinely one of two things that kept me alive. The thing that got me up every morning was the thought ""how many days until Spurs play next?"" I loved Spurs so much I didn't think it was possible that I'd lose interest and that I *wouldn't* think about the next game upon waking up. Well... I guess 4 years of freefall would do that. I've been a Spurs fan since the first Spurs game I watched back in 2007 and I had never ever missed a game that I could watch from 2008 until now, even friendlies. I've watched maybe half of our games in 2023. I don't care when we play or who we play anymore. But contrary to what some would say, it's not because I'm not a ""real fan"", quite the opposite, it's because I care a lot and it hurts far too much to be a Spurs fan right now.

How the fuck does a team that's not won anything have the arrogance to not simply not advance, but even play properly for the majority of the game?

Just wall to wall dogshit. I think I'd let Davies and maybe Forster off from criticism for last night but that's about it.

I quite simply never want to see Lucas Moura play for us ever again. Davinson Sanchez somehow still continues to regress year-on-year from the player he was for Ajax six years ago. I like Richarlison but the no goals stuff is alarming now and this was his shot to play in his favoured position and he fucked it. The zone of negative chemistry that is Son and Perisic continues. Eric Dier, who I also like, has now been given the captain's armband for what is, for me, the worst domestic cup exits we've had in recent history with this game and Colchester in the League Cup a few years back (I get we've had some other poor cup exits and maybe it's just as this one is so fresh in the memory and the remaining pool of teams is so bad but it's got to be right up there).

Defending for their goal was just shit, and it's only because what happened in front of him was so bad that I'm not throwing Forster under the bus, but he probably could have done better as well. I think I haven't namechecked Porro yet (not the impact you'd want from a RWB in this system but it's only his second game or whatever for us so reserving judgement) and Davies gets a pass as the goal wasn't really his fault, and if you're needing your left centre back to help with the attack then a shit load of other things have gone wrong. Hojbjerg and Sarr just meh. Hojbjerg for the goal it looks awful, I get he was trying to not give away a penalty but I think he could have done a lot more and not done so. Who is left? Kane and Kulusevski feels a bit harsh but were on enough to make some difference and while we were better going forward the key stat of goals scored still reads 0. Perisic putting in probably his best cross since the world cup (that isn't necessarily a compliment) for Kane to head it that far wide at the death really was just the cherry on top of a completely dogshit performance. Danjuma had pitch inspection minutes out of position so whatever. Skipp, I just give up on this post now so, also, whatever. Fuck everything, but anyway... COYS.",Spurs,No,jam508w,t3_11fursc

"After letting my emotions run it‚Äôs course, looking at what stellini said, I would agree with that notion that the team wasn‚Äôt mentally there. Bar the defense, we had a team more than capable of getting at least a goal in. 

But this also shows just how significant having a solid defense is in a team set up like this, no one else can tick unless the defense is reliable. I‚Äôm no psychic but if conte were to stay, we need a reliable 1st team and 2nd team defense in come next season.",Spurs,No,jalb1c1,t3_11fursc
Anyone else thinking Porro is pretty rubbish. In the games I‚Äôve seen him in a Spurs shirt he looks really poor. Where are the ppl who posted in Jan that it‚Äôs a must that we get him‚Ä¶. (And it can‚Äôt be a confidence thing) I just think yet again we‚Äôve signed a dud (lucky it‚Äôs on loan - right?),Spurs,No,jan3u54,t3_11fursc
"Our team definitely needs a new CB, and given that the club will spend around 80 million euros to buy Porro and Kulusevski, there won't be a major signing. 

So how can we get some money? Lenglet isn't cutting it. He is not defensively solid and his salary is too high. Just let him go after this loan. Sanchez is a joke. We gotta sell him for at least 10-15m; Tanganga is much better in my view. Hell, even our young guns from the academy like Paskotski and Fagan-Walcott would be better than Sanchez.  

Why do we need 4th keeper? Either Austin or Whiteman needs to go. Earn that little bit of money.

With the return of Udogie and Reguilon, we will have four left backs. I would say that Reguilon needs to go; sell him for about 20m. Perisic can't defend. Maybe playing him as attacker is a better option.

Ah, the midfield. Lo Celso and Ndombele could also earn us that little bit of money. Don't seem to need them at all. 

Also, why did we even sign Danjuma if he isn't even playing? What would we do with him when Gil returns from loan? I guess there is no need to sign him on a permanent basis.",Spurs,No,jalcjn8,t3_11fursc
"We always play at the level of the opposition it feels like. Fully expect us to thrash Milan now they are good again, before getting absolutely destroyed by Nottingham",Spurs,No,jalk4zx,t3_11fursc
Would you sacrifice your favourite current player of it meant we got any current manager you wanted this summer?,Spurs,No,jaoiuut,t3_11fursc
Paratici needs to go regardless of what happens to Conte.,Spurs,No,jalcpno,t3_11fursc
"It‚Äôs genuinely so over with Son. Will always love the guy but he‚Äôs completely finished, like playing with 10 men

Rare to see this type of drop off. From being like the best player in the league to not putting a foot right on the pitch, over 1 summer",Spurs,No,jaldsip,t3_11fursc
"To think we‚Äôve spent 1.7billion in the same span Man U and Liverpool spent 2.1 and 1.9 respectively, and we have 1 trophy compared to Man U‚Äôs 32 trophies and however many Liverpool have is embarrassing. We‚Äôve spent more than Woolwich and they have so much more to show for it. This club is an absolute joke",Spurs,No,jams8ku,t3_11fursc
What do you guys think about that Ahmedhodzic fella from Sheffield. I‚Äôm Bosnian so a bit bias but I‚Äôve watched him play and wondered if he caught y‚Äôall eye yesterday. Really modern CB and we need defenders and he won‚Äôt cost a fortune,Spurs,No,jan575p,t3_11fursc
"What grinds my gears is the repetitive impulse buying of ‚Äúbargain‚Äù players. Bergwijn, Vinicius, Ndombele, Gedson, Lo Celso... all of them gone. And now Richarlison and Danjuma.",Spurs,No,jan4sv9,t3_11fursc
"I get everyone being down after crashing out of a very winnable cup. I would love to see us win a trophy so badly. But really I think we can make a good CL run especially if a couple of big teams draw each other next round. Im not saying we are likely to win the UCL but I think we are capable of beating every team in the competition. Real/Bayern/Napoli are obviously the most scary but not impossible.

What dissapoints me the most is the mentality from our fringe players. Son and Richarlison both should be trying to prove why they should be starting and neither one impressed. There really should be a hunger if youre not getting minutes to impress but it just doesnt seem to be the case.",Spurs,No,jamyn2v,t3_11fursc
"A couple months ago there was a graphic posted from the Athletic ranking all our signings above 20m ""hit"", ""miss"" or ""jury's out"". It didn't look good, but Richarlison was ranked as a hit bizarrely.

I think the subsequent 2 months have confirmed what many of us thought at the time - which is that was way too generous. Even ""Jury's out"" might be generous. A ¬£60m signing for a club like Spurs needs to be the difference maker week in week out. And after watching him for nearly a season (when he's fit) I'm not sure he's ever going to be more than a hard working passionate poacher. That said, it would be really helpful if he could at least reproduce the 15 g/a he did in his best seasons at Everton.",Spurs,No,jaojjgt,t3_11fursc
"Came on here to say exactly the same thing. Just furious. Usually I know Spurs are going to disappoint me so I just let losses wash over me. But the fact this was easily our best chance of a trophy and our main rival looks likely to win the PL just drives me crazy. 

How can the players just have that little respect for us fans?",Spurs,Yes,jalqvvl,t1_jalp582
"Let‚Äôs say we just focus on when we really started on a trajectory with Harry Redknapp getting us in the UCL for the first time. That was 13 years ago. And in THIRTEEN YEARS we haven‚Äôt even won an EFL/FA Cup. It‚Äôs pathetic. 

And our fans who say trophies aren‚Äôt the only measure of success just boil my piss. They‚Äôre part of the lack of ambition our club oozes.",Spurs,Yes,jam5l4h,t1_jam05l0
"Don‚Äôt worry buddy, we have a new go-kart and F1 track being built!! Woo hoo!!",Spurs,Yes,jam0sis,t1_jam05l0
"Because they have a project, and a manager with a modern tactical style and have brought the right players in accordingly. 

We keep hiring short term serial winner managers thinking that will take us to the next level without actually having to do any of the work.",Spurs,Yes,jam1cpy,t1_jam05l0
"Yep so true, plus the three that played last night have next to zero creativity. Doesn‚Äôt also help that Kulu has looked completely shot of confidence in recent weeks as well. Maybe he‚Äôs still carrying an injury I‚Äôm not sure.",Spurs,Yes,jam5zza,t1_jam4yee
"And if you are going to start whatever forwards, why not start Danjuma over lucas/son to get him into form as well? I‚Äôm still so confused by the lineup yeaterday",Spurs,Yes,jan1oxc,t1_jam4yee
"Oh christ that bleak. 

If its any consolation i did the same for the away lisbon loss this year.",Spurs,Yes,jam28yt,t1_jam02r9

I‚Äôm so sorry,Spurs,Yes,jam16bn,t1_jam02r9
"Wouldn't be surprised if we go through against Milan and get battered in the next round against any half decent side.

That's what these players do. They turn up one game, get your hopes up then play like absolute dross the next.

It's even worse than being shit all the time because at least then, you don't have any expectations. What us fans get now is just cruel",Spurs,Yes,jam9mit,t1_jam96mn
Best I can do is Richarlison-Kane-Son and Danjuma plays 3 minutes of additonal time when we're 0-2 down,Spurs,Yes,jaltzow,t1_jalrc58
"We should have played Richy as the 9 with Danjuma on the left. If we were determined to rest Kulu then Lucas could have started on the right.

With Perisic being killing momentum and Son poor with his back to goal it would have been great to have a player who can both hold the ball and bring others in as well as beat a man from a standing start on the left.",Spurs,Yes,jaltz17,t1_jalrc58
I feel so bad for you guys. Having to wake up in the middle of the night to watch us play terror football every week qualifies as self harm atp. I would have checked out years ago if I had to wake up at 4-5 AM to watch Mourinhos spurs concede 2 late goals and get beat for a whole season.,Spurs,Yes,jalo9s1,t1_jalnse2
The fact that all 4 competitions are on 4 separate services is brutal now considering it used to be on just 2 a couple seasons ago.,Spurs,Yes,jamcyfr,t1_jalnse2
You‚Äôll get three days tops and like it,Spurs,Yes,jalp68e,t1_jaln42t
"We created a ton of chances. That‚Äôs what the tactics do. We couldn‚Äôt finish. That‚Äôs what the players do.

Richy‚Äôs finishing was woeful, Son is deep in his own head and lacking confidence, Lucas was alright but still ineffective, both WBs had a couple errant shots and a few wandering crosses. The final ball was usually shit and the chances that were created went unfinished.",Spurs,Yes,jam397v,t1_jam21s5
the only reasonable defence of it is if Danjuma isn‚Äôt doing great in training which was the reason for Spence and Bissouma not getting minutes at first and obviously we wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell if this is the case. But I agree I‚Äôd much rather see Danjuma so hopefully they‚Äôre not just putting Moura ahead of him for experience and seniority or whatever.,Spurs,Yes,jalda14,t1_jald3ku
Moura played well to be fair.,Spurs,Yes,jalgf1j,t1_jald3ku
">we're judging Richarlison as a flop and Son as being awful but in the game yesterday alone how many clear cut chances did they really have?

You're talking as if these guys have no impact on whether we create chances or not. Very odd. People are criticising Son and Richy for their failure to control the fucking ball.",Spurs,Yes,jalh8rp,t1_jalfdi6
We have only one truly creative player in Kulu. We need a creator on the left which Son isn‚Äôt. We also need creators at WB. Porro is creative but he‚Äôs just getting integrated and idk what the fuck happened to Perisic,Spurs,Yes,jalg71p,t1_jalfdi6
Its not a surprise tbh our best way of consistently creating chances in open play is playing out from the back then firing a low pass into kane who holds it up against 3 defenders at a time then kane switches it into a wingback bombing on who crosses into the box with 1 teammate in there,Spurs,Yes,jaligd1,t1_jalfdi6
The away support was excellent. Shame the players didn't put in half the effort,Spurs,Yes,jalj1me,t1_jaliovp
You guys deserve a statue for paying actual money to travel and support these bunch of rats,Spurs,Yes,jalmjkv,t1_jaliovp

Actually, it really did.",Spurs,Yes,jaloq54,t1_jaliovp

">im Sheffield

typo or German?",Spurs,Yes,jamzgvo,t1_jaliovp
"It‚Äôs painful, Kane/Son/Richarlison/Kulusevski were supposed to be one of the best attacking cores in the league and 3/4 have been massively disappointing. It‚Äôs bizarre given that all 4 had great seasons last year.",Spurs,Yes,jamcydj,t1_jam8ceh
"I think Kulu has had a tough time coming back from injury personally.

Son on the other hand I think may be on the downslope of his career, at this point it really doesn‚Äôt seem just like poor form when it‚Äôs been ongoing all season.",Spurs,Yes,jamhbvo,t1_jam8ceh
"Moments towards the end of the match last night, Son was so frustrating to watch. At one point around the 90' a 70/30 ball was sort of in the air between him and another player on the edge of the box and he just throws a leg at it aimlessly and into nothing. Really sad to see, if Conte stays I can't see how Son will work in this system effectively. Kulusevski very off the boil as well.",Spurs,Yes,jamir0v,t1_jam8ceh
"What I really don't get is Conte is historically a domestic merchant who focuses all energy on one trophy per year. It obviously wasn't going to be the league, so I don't understand the mentality yesterday at all.",Spurs,Yes,jaluam8,t1_jalqum7
I mean Mourinho did reach a Carabao cup final.,Spurs,Yes,jamezh7,t1_jalqum7
What did Dier even do wrong lol it‚Äôs so crazy how the mentality here is ‚Äúoh we lost? Blame Dier‚Äù our worst players last night by far were Perisic and Richarlison,Spurs,Yes,jam4eja,t1_jam47wv
"Next year we will have another defensive mamager with third choice transfers at 40m ""cause the prem is getting too expensive!!!"", and losing again",Spurs,Yes,jamh7uv,t1_jamb7n3

Let's not forget we lost to forest B in the league cup as well,Spurs,Yes,jalyi2q,t1_jalwjzh
We just can't creat chances for our forwards. I think the team was good enough to win but the way we play always gives the initiative to the opposition,Spurs,Yes,jaly0sw,t1_jalwjzh
Toxicity here is insane,Spurs,Yes,jameli1,t1_jam8d9g
"yeah its getting ridiculous, I get it we are all pretty fucking pissed and tired of this but Jesus man its still a game",Spurs,Yes,jam8txz,t1_jam8d9g
"thats honestly a shame. Although I'm not surprised. I think it starts from the fact that people can't seem to take that having different opinions doesn't make that person wrong. Honestly I think its really common on reddit. The downvote button also makes it easier to just ignore other people's opinions just because you don't want to hear them. 

Those abusive DMs should not be happening. Sorry about that.",Spurs,Yes,jam8ywi,t1_jam8d9g
I am contributing to the toxicity and I hate it but I hate the brain dead takes in here,Spurs,Yes,jamhcn7,t1_jam8d9g
We actually named him our captain in the previous round as well.,Spurs,Yes,jali847,t1_jalhw9q
The summer? End his contract now and pay him to leave.,Spurs,Yes,jali6x4,t1_jalhw9q
Exactly this. Was gonna compose a near identical comment. Watching the gradual step downs of the blindly optimistic is a sick kind of pleasure. By the time they realise we should have made a managerial change in January there will be nothing left to hold on to.,Spurs,Yes,jaml8dq,t1_jamile1
"lol thats how I feel except for the conference league part. I think we can get europa league at least and there still is a chance for top 4, I'm not too confident though.",Spurs,Yes,jamjhpk,t1_jamile1
Yea I see a lot of complaints about the lineup but every club has to rotate throughout the season. Especially with CL return leg looming our rotated squad has to be capable of managing Sheffield United's rotated team. We had some okay stretches creating half chances but large portions of the game we spent lumping it forward and giving it right back to them.,Spurs,Yes,jamp57q,t1_jamopju
"There was more than enough talent on the pitch to win that game comfortably. It was also a very experienced side that should know how to manage a game like that and get a result. There is really no excuse for it, besides the players not taking it seriously, which is astonishing.",Spurs,Yes,jampnon,t1_jamopju
"No it's worse, Sheffield United rotated too üíÄ",Spurs,Yes,jaljg2q,t1_jale91z
"Under which manager? But sure bring him back. 

Everyone has rose tinted glasses with Poch because he loves the club but everyone has amnesia about Poch post-UCL final. Not to mentioned all these transfers he wanted that are *still* a millstone around our neck",Spurs,Yes,jam3hhk,t1_jam0zx1
Get used to it mate. r/soccer is a huge circlejerk for that type of shit. The same rehashed jokes over and over and over.,Spurs,Yes,jao8jo9,t1_janzjwl

We don‚Äôt make it easy on ourselves do we,Spurs,Yes,japz7a6,t1_janzjwl
He changed his mind like a week later and said something like five windows,Spurs,Yes,jan39xi,t1_jamz3by
"Well he still has one transfer window left doesn‚Äôt he? And next years transfer window will be our most important one because every player we want will be available and we‚Äôll finally complete our rebuild

That is if Conte stays",Spurs,Yes,jan1p4j,t1_jamz3by
"Can relate to most of this, the season has been pretty dead from the start honestly. Here are the players we signed largely because of getting CL: Perisic, Richarlison, Bissouma, and Pedro Porro. None of them have been performing at an acceptable level. People want CL to see us compete against the biggest teams in Europe, but we don't even have a squad that can take us far enough in the competition. Now we're highly likely gonna enter the next season with Kane going to United and with a new manager (god knows how that's going to go after they passed on Ten Hag to go for Nuno), but somehow everything is okay because we have a chance against Milan and are still in the top 4, makes sense to me",Spurs,Yes,jalofhf,t1_jalka6e
"I dunno I think we all kind of agree with the narrative don't we? We are in a great spot for top 4, would be nice to know if conte is staying one way or another, the football is boring but can be effective. That's kind of agreed. 

I think last night was just a big flash point as it seems pretty obvious that the FA cup is a bigger priority for the fans than it is for the club?",Spurs,Yes,jambqot,t1_jam56s4
"I think the narrative is about the same that it's been for years now: our starting eleven can do a job, but our rotation options suck dick.",Spurs,Yes,jam5xin,t1_jam56s4
Hahahaha it‚Äôs hilarious,Spurs,Yes,jamo7v8,t1_jam56s4
"Hate to say it but yeah, he‚Äôs not got that Tom Brady about him as he would say

Indisputable legend of the game but tends to go missing when the chance at silverware is there",Spurs,Yes,jamng8a,t1_jammers
"We‚Äôre all mad, but come on Kane has scored probably 20 goals to win us games in the final few minutes. Off the top of my head city last year, PSV when were going out of the champions league groups a few years back, even the disallowed goal vs Sporting this year was a good finish",Spurs,Yes,jamypbm,t1_jammers
"why did we start Lucas Moura over Danjuma. Lucas was our best player, but that still doesn't excuse Conte for starting Lucas over Danjuma. Why did we buy Danjuma then? 

Bipolar or not, we have a right to be frustrated.",Spurs,Yes,jamrv0r,t1_jamrf8j
"Because the players we brought in weren‚Äôt as great as people were making them out to be 7 months ago. We also have a few injuries. We played with a rotated side against both Portsmouth and Preston, we won those games but we struggled almost as much as yesterday.  People were calling all week for the manager to play the strongest lineup, because it‚Äôs the best chance of us winning a trophy in a longtime considering the teams left in the mix, and sacrifice a result at Wolves if need be. 

It also doesn‚Äôt help that Conte hardly rotates and throws on all these players that barely have any individual minutes to play all together against a team that will absolutely be up for it. When the lineups were released so many of us immediately got worried because we‚Äôve seen this shit for the past 6 years.",Spurs,Yes,jamtkv8,t1_jamrf8j
"A lot of people were saying we should rotate against Wolves, not Sheff U or Milan",Spurs,Yes,jamzb4c,t1_jamrf8j
"I just don‚Äôt see the point in finishing top 4 from a fan perspective vs winning the FA cup. I mean what‚Äôs going to bring me more joy? Getting drummed by AC Milan or Real or Man City in the quarters or winning a fucking trophy?  I get it from ENICs perspective. They need to cash to buy more real estate. But from where I‚Äôm sitting, it does me no good to get top 4 and bring in more players that will lose the FA CUP in round 4 to Dorchester and get hammered in the champions league quarters.",Spurs,Yes,jamtczz,t1_jamsbzf
"What did Arsenal do the 2 previous years?

Are Man City progression?  Chelsea?  Liverpool?

Your expectations are not aligned with reality - we are building a young side which is not ready yet.",Spurs,Yes,jamta37,t1_jamsbzf
The thing is Richarlison and Bissouma have looked really good in the prem. They look worse under this system though.,Spurs,Yes,jalio09,t1_jalgqvl
"Richarlison, Bissouma, Porro can come good in time. Perisic though is a complete mercenary",Spurs,Yes,jali3wr,t1_jalgqvl
Wouldn't that make us the common denominator of the problem?,Spurs,Yes,jalhit8,t1_jalgqvl
Porro might improve..give him time... although not sure about the price tag,Spurs,Yes,jaljrm5,t1_jalgqvl
"As long as we‚Äôre gonna be ran as a money machine, not as a football club? No chance",Spurs,Yes,jalqxb8,t1_jalpj7f
I'd take that tbf.,Spurs,Yes,jamzg0r,t1_jamyf05
And what about the previous years we haven‚Äôt got it over the line? This endless cycle of managers and lack of ambition that infects our club/fan base needs to end first.,Spurs,Yes,jam670a,t1_jalvkzd
"thats why i dont mind city. I geniunely enjoyed it when they were on top of the league. Now that Arsenal and Utd are gonna be alternating between titles, its going to be rough. Woolwich fans and Utd back to talking shit is not what I'm here for lol. at least it isnt chelsea.",Spurs,Yes,jamjra0,t1_jamd2ug
Champions League pays our bills. Plus you think we‚Äôre recruiting a player like Romero because we came in 8th but won the FA Cup? Please.,Spurs,Yes,janrogy,t1_jann5ee
"There shouldnt be a choice tho,  never winnjng ucl if u cant winfa",Spurs,Yes,jano53e,t1_jann5ee
Your taking a tiny chance of fluking our way to a final over winning the best cup competition in the world that we have a great history in?,Spurs,Yes,jao8ioz,t1_jann5ee

Milan is playing at their best recently,Spurs,Yes,jaljsvb,t1_jalgfz2
Get him fucking out of here. Bring home Poch. I want to feel something about the club again. I hate that we have a manager who thinks he's too good for us. I know we're shit but need we keep being reminded?,Spurs,Yes,jalqxz5,t1_jalov1n
The number of times you‚Äôve been corrected on the spelling of Hitchen has to be in the tens of millions by this point,Spurs,Yes,jamnn98,t1_jamkfjr
Tbf Davidson was really good at Ajax. Hindsight is 20/20 but we all thought he was the chosen one to follow in the footsteps of Jan and Toby,Spurs,Yes,jammu37,t1_jamkfjr
Porro can perfectly play as a offensive full back in back four,Spurs,Yes,jant8ce,t1_jann1rt
"I agree, but it isn't even just that we might sack Conte - his contract is out at the end of the season so it isn't just not *firing* him but actually convincing him to *stay* that we need to do for our recent moves to look sensible financially.",Spurs,Yes,janpmpf,t1_jann1rt
Didn't Poch have his best season with us playing with wingbacks?,Spurs,Yes,janqiu5,t1_jann1rt
">with the first two (and Spence) only being able to play as wingbacks

strange, because they have both played quite a bit as FBs before",Spurs,Yes,janzle5,t1_jann1rt
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll look good in a back 4 that doesn‚Äôt consist of Eric Dier or Davinson Sanchez but I doubt we sign anyone to replace them.,Spurs,Yes,janyse8,t1_jann1rt
"It's how it is after every loss now and it bums me the fuck out. Yes it sucks that we're out of the cup AGAIN, but people have no nuance.",Spurs,Yes,jaoyd0e,t1_jaonasl
"Richies a flop so far no matter how you figure it. 655 minutes played, zero goals. I actually think he‚Äôs quality and misused by Contes shit system, but be that as it may, he‚Äôs a flop (so far).",Spurs,Yes,jap1uvy,t1_jaonasl

Definitely on the players..just loser mentality..no other way around it,Spurs,Yes,jamcjk2,t1_jam508w
"I've said this but keep getting hammered for it. I just think the culture at the club just doesn't value the cups. 

The whole focus of the squad this last 2 weeks will have been the Chelsea and west ham games and then Milan. 

I just feel like for the fans we all saw the FA cup as a really good chance this year. Whereas the club players and manager do care about it, but there was no focus on it at all and it was a bit of an afterthought.",Spurs,Yes,jan11cw,t1_jamzr21
Yesterday showed that Conte is only concerned with the league.  Cup football is suited to our defend and break/set piece game. It‚Äôs about passion and creating opportunities. We don‚Äôt have a player that can turn a game or a system that allows such a player to flourish. Sheffield deserved the win because they wanted it two times as much. If we‚Äôd matched their passion we would have would through quality.,Spurs,Yes,jaljm26,t1_jalipup
"Yeah this sub is definitely not very enjoyable anymore. One positive for me is that earlier in the season I started blocking people who were just being needlessly negative or posting such awful takes it‚Äôs hard to tell if they‚Äôre trolling or not. 

I don‚Äôt mind having a different opinion to others here, in fact it‚Äôs been one of the best things about this sub, being able to have solid and sensible debates about things. But now it just seems pretty much impossible when the majority of takes are just overly negative and the people posting them don‚Äôt want to hear any other viewpoints.",Spurs,Yes,jalpbri,t1_jalmp0l
"There are too many ""new"" fans here especially from overseas during the pandemic, when Premier League was broadcast into many new lockdown homes.

But even for the older traditional based UK fans like me, it has been a depressingly long period of no silverware. And to go out of the FA Cup again in such a despicable manner is not acceptable from this club. When we last won the FA Cup in 1991 we were the historical top winners of the competition with 8 wins - now it's still 8 wins more than 30 years later! (Same as Liverpool and Chelsea btw) .

I'd prefer the FA Cup than top 4 - problem is, the management and many new fans don't want that, top 4 is the priority.

It doesn't help that likes of Arsenal are doing well again either, I think if we lose/draw to Wolves and/or Milan it may be the tipping point for some ie if you think it's bad now wait until next week (fingers crossed we actually win both games)",Spurs,Yes,jalnils,t1_jalmp0l
"Mate we've just got beaten by a championship sides reserve team. The FA cup is wode open and our best chance of winning a decent trophy in ages. It's nit just a one off game it's the whole approach and mindset. 

Throw in the fact that lingterm we have no idea who our manager will be past the summer and there's a good chance our greatest ever player will leave....precisely to win trophies like the one we threw last night. 

People being annoyed at that isn't doomsaying. It's a very frustrating situation at the moment.",Spurs,Yes,jalwrkw,t1_jalmp0l
I feel the same way. Cant think of many games this season ive enjoyed from 1 to 90 all season and I hate the slow and lethargic play when we are clearly capable of better.

"We gave conte exactly what he wanted. Put perishit on 190k a week for God's sake. It's one thing going on about how a bad worksman blames his tools, but conte bloody handpicked his tools and still whinges that they're not the right ones.

"What part did Levy play last night?  Did he miss a sitter?  Did he fail to perform against a Championship side?  Did he fail to save a shot which was almost straight at him?  Did he fail to change the system when it was clear it wasn't working?  Did he continually cross the ball despite never finding a teammate?

I would like to know why it is Levy's fault when we played 14 internationals and an U21 and have basically the most expensive management team in world football.",Spurs,Yes,jamnlp7,t1_jamlxo5

There is a calibre of fan which just cannot comprehend how we operate and what they are actually asking for.  We have a stark choice:  dubious billionaire owner, state owner or something very similar to what we have now.

It is better the devil you know in my book and the bigger the club becomes the more we can spend on the football.  Make no mistake, ENIC's work will not be done and their valuation will not be reached until there is on-field success.",Spurs,Yes,jamohey,t1_jamcvbn

"Dier does not deserve blame for last game but the number of mistakes he has made this season leaves me wanting a successor regardless.

"Dier isn‚Äôt suddenly a shit player. He‚Äôs always been shit.

You can‚Äôt blame the ‚Äòsystem‚Äô on Dier making the same braindead, baffling mistakes that put us in danger almost every other game. That‚Äôs always been part of his game. He‚Äôs been at the club 8 years it‚Äôs time to go.

You're on here everyday with one hot take after the other as to which world class player, manager, sporting director we should sign, all of your bullshit is predicated on the fact that we're a top club, how did that come to be, jackass?

"It's such a weird feeling. Last year in the same situation at least it felt like we were building towards something even with only top 4 to play for. This season not having anything to play for other than top 4 just feels like going through the motions. The only thing that would salvage some purpose for the remainder of the season would be Conte signing an extension or him being replaced.

Conte (and Mourinho) have won a trophy at EVERY club they've coached though...is it really the manager's fault at this point? There's a consistent mentality in the squad throughout multiple managers where they play arrogantly and with little effort against weaker competition and bottle it.",Spurs,Yes,janksp9,t1_jamqp14

Teams figuring us out is causing Sanchez to look like a toddler on the football pitch? Causing Hojbjerg to head the ball into the path of attacking players so they can have a free run at goal? Causing Davies to be unable to play simple passes and constantly giving the ball away?,Spurs,Yes,jalfa4l,t1_jalf3f8
"Simply not true. He played a number of good passes that led to dangerous situations and the one time he got to the byline he played a dangerous cutback. 

Would like to see him play with Kulusevski and Romero on that side.",Spurs,Yes,jam4dn3,t1_jam3d89
He didn‚Äôt pass the ball back whenever he had it lol he made some really good passes and had good interplay with the frontline. He wasn‚Äôt incredible but he was fine. Can‚Äôt expect him to defend effectively with Sanchez next to him.,Spurs,Yes,jam3kcv,t1_jam3d89
That didn't really happen. He beat his man a fair few times and put some decent crosses in. He was one of the better players which isn't saying much but still...,Spurs,Yes,jam3q3k,t1_jam3d89

"Nah mate I'm a season ticket  holder and all my matchday going friends are probably even more annoyed than here. 

The problem is fans want a trophy and this fa cup was really open for us. However you can tell by the team selection and also just the players application that it's not a priority for them. 

That's what's annoying everyone so much I think. It's a sort of symbol of fans vs club and the differences in approach.",Spurs,Yes,jamcdpp,t1_jamauc4

">we should rip off the band-aid and sell Kane (unless he wants to stay for another project) and not renew Conte. We keep hiring ""win now"" managers to get Kane to stay and believe he can win a trophy here, but we simply don't have the supporting cast (particularly defense) to achieve this

Or - and stop me if I'm being absolutely crazy here - we continue to build the defence to challenge this summer?!

I can't fathom the ridiculousness of 'fans' suggesting we sell our greatest ever goal scorer, one-man club and heartbeat of the team because they don't like the manager with the second-most points per game in the entire history of Tottenham Hotspur.

"The footballs horrible and we seem to be getting worse despite giving him lots of the players he wants. He's making good players like son Richi and Bissouma much worse. 

There's loads if manager choices. Poch is a nailed on option who would come in a heartbeat. Why wouldn't Enrique come in? Potter will probably be available too. De Zerbi at Brighton has a 10m release clause.

"When your senior players have become synonymous with years of failure you won't win anything unless those players are got rid of.

It's not even just about their quality it's about a mentality that has become part of who they are and poisons the whole squad.  They are used to losing, they are used to this type of thing. We have seen that same game play out many times. It happened under Poch, Mourinho and now Conte. 

There is massive value in having leaders who are winners on the pitch. Look at the difference Casemiro, Varane and Martinez have made for Man Utd. Even Zinchenko and Jesus have had a similar effect at Arsenal. These types of players raise standards and levels.

"You aren't wrong Vertonghen and Lloris went this way.

"Can we even sell Son right now for 35m? He is on HORRIFIC form ffs. It's just like Eriksen before he moved to Inter. I'm personally hoping we can get Sonny back in form (with a new system) and then we can try to sell him for 35m or higher. 

It really pains me, and I get you wanting to be pragmatic, but I'm not sure Sonny can be sold for that amount. Sadio frickin Mane on great form last season was sold for 40 million to Bayern, we won't get too much money for him. The smart idea is to try to get Sonny playing better in a new system and then selling high on him (when he has his purple patch) in January or whatever next season. Thats all we can really do. Selling Sonny on a 5 million or 10 million deal won't really do this squad any good tbh.",Spurs,Yes,jam9yea,t1_jalnjx2

Meanwhile if the coaching staff and players took this game seriously, we would have drawn Blackburn in the next round and potentially have had an extremely easy path to the final.

And how was Jol treated in the end? Sacked at halftime in a game we won. Disgusting. 

Levy getting bailed out after his first choice manager didn‚Äôt work out, where have we heard that before..?",Spurs,Yes,jan0h5i,t1_jam5l4h

He really didn't. The same ol' headless running until he bounced of a crowd of defenders.",Spurs,Yes,jalp41z,t1_jalgf1j
"I think he was a bright spot, but he wasn't effective. Compare what happens when Moura dribbles the ball past players and when Deki does it. With Deki he takes the ball to dangerous areas and we know he can link up or cross or shoot. Moura rarely manages any of that.",Spurs,Yes,jalnl84,t1_jalgf1j
"I'm saying they were hardly put in positions to create chances considering how long it takes us to shift the ball up the pitch sometimes with the aimless passing from side to side 

Son also being played centrally and so much deeper than Perisic is a crime",Spurs,Yes,jalif40,t1_jalh8rp
"It is incredibly painful. 

I'm not sure even with a creator on the left and if Perisic returns to his form last season we would actually be any better, we play such slow football but with little purpose in so many passes before playing direct.

I feel Contes system only works with elite dribblers as the two ""10s"" as they're consistently expected to beat 2-3 people",Spurs,Yes,jalibbc,t1_jalg71p
"We definitely need a Kulu on the left

"It's because for us top 4 is a trophy now. While Arsenal have made us look like laughing stocks by getting a squad that noone rated last season on their way to winning the league, here we are hoping for a top 4 trophy.",Spurs,Yes,jalykcq,t1_jaluam8
Yeah I agree. Dier wasn‚Äôt even bad imo. Sanchez was god awful but perisic was by far the worst player on the pitch. Such a shame as I thought he was nailed on to be a hit when he signed him.,Spurs,Yes,jam5755,t1_jam4eja
"I'd like to put Hojberg into that mix. He seemed to have his ""I've been overplayed and ill turn rubbish"" game last night.",Spurs,Yes,jam51af,t1_jam4eja

"Samchez had a decent season with us at one point. The problem was we then switched to drop deep managers and he's woefull. 

Similarly if we now switch to a manger who doesn't use wingbacks we are going to be stuck with Udogie Porro Spence and Sess none of which can really play as standard roght/left backs

Ndombele granted was just a bad signing. Altho at the time it was seen as a real coup that we got him instead of city!",Spurs,Yes,jam49ke,t1_jam3hhk

"Out of interest mate what do you want to happen, I ask as a I do value your (less hot) takes!

I'm split between letting him finish his 3 window thing. But at the same time.....we are bloody hard to watch. I want to believe that he is a couple of defenders and goalkeeper away from suddenly clicking.....but at the same time a lot of the players seem to just be gradually regressing under him. 

I'm not sure what wins out atm, my optimism he is really close or my pessimism that even with the new players things will just keep gradually sliding and this time next year we will be looking for a new manager but with a squad assembled to play an incredibly specific way.",Spurs,Yes,jan3jkx,t1_jan1p4j
I think op is referring to the Manager narrative,Spurs,Yes,jam8khn,t1_jam5xin
"I agree. It made no sense to start Lucas over Danjuma. But then again it made no sense to never start Spence or to sell Doherty. It made no sense to never start Skipp until you are forced to. It makes no sense to keep starting Son

"Does Conte even want to be here is the question.He hasn't signed a new contract which suggests that he really doesn't want to be here.

This club needs a complete rebuild in various areas.Our youth academy is simply not good enough  I haven't seen many players progress through the academy to the first team.The second issue is our spending in this inflated market you either have to have an excellent scouting department that are able to find the hidden gems or you need to spend heavily at least upwards of 200 mill.We don't have a good scouting department and we also don't spend big.The third issue is the actual vision and ambition of the club do they simply want top 4 or do they actually want to win trophies because I don't see any effort being made to show that we are aiming to win trophies.


I feel like next transfer window is going to be mess.Paratici still going through the juve case which leaves the club in uncertainty .It looks like Conte isn't going to be here next season.We have a squad is too big with all the players on loan coming back and so we will need to offload alot of these players.The team needs alot improvements such as a new gk, wingers and defenders.",Spurs,Yes,jameqdk,t1_jam670a
This is where I‚Äôm at. I really don‚Äôt believe getting rid of the manager actually solves anything. The problems have persisted for years now and several managers. Projects take time to develop.,Spurs,Yes,jamc681,t1_jam670a
"Yeah I‚Äôve always been the same, couldn‚Äôt care less about the oil and gangster clubs because in my twisted mind none of their trophies ever counted anyway, and like you said it held the previous super clubs at bay.

And tbh they all brought it on themselves with the money introduced through the PL and the CL, there really wasn‚Äôt a road to success without the influx of money from the outside after that.

It‚Äôs gutting that we‚Äôre one of the few clubs who‚Äôve tried to do it the proper way and likely will have nothing to show for it.",Spurs,Yes,jamkfeg,t1_jamjra0
Why do we suddenly go 8th if we actually compete for a cup? Why is it always one or the other. And beating fucking Sheffield United should not be the factor determining which outcome we have,Spurs,Yes,jaode8z,t1_janrogy
Champions league money is a drop in the bucket compared to all the Disney lane shit at the stadium now. That‚Äôs where the real revenue comes from,Spurs,Yes,jant58v,t1_janrogy

honestly tho we typically play better vs teams at their best rather than teams struggling. It's the Tottenham way,Spurs,Yes,jalk8nu,t1_jaljsvb

They‚Äôre an easy target and it is lazy to blame them, but here and on r/soccer you really can spot Americans a mile off. It‚Äôs not all American fans obviously and people post shit takes from all over the world, UK included, but I really think a lot of the negativity is coming from people who have much less of a connection to the club than others and who don‚Äôt appreciate how far we‚Äôve actually come. 

I‚Äôm fuming at the FA cup exit too, and Arsenal looking like they‚Äôre going to win the league makes me sick, but people posting constant negativity and posts such as the one last night saying we should remove ourselves from the big 6 just don‚Äôt help anything.",Spurs,Yes,jalps2e,t1_jalnils

"> what we *paid* for Richarlison

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*",Spurs,Yes,jalcp9l,t1_jalcopp
He probably won't be here next season which tells you something.He acted like he was in it for the long run by saying we need patience and that it takes a few seasons to be title contenders.

Instead of seeing they simply won‚Äôt get us through these games and selling them for a loss and finding someone who can get us through, he offers them new contracts. That‚Äôs why Daniel levy and the board have massively let down this fan base, not actually building a squad that‚Äôs capable of achieving anything, year in, year out, except maybe get top 4 (with the help of other teams being shit).

"Why would a dumb spend happy non state affiliated billionaire be either impossible to achieve or worse than the current situation? I'll buy into this amazing sustainable model when I see it bearing fruit, because it's been a significant time of the club pushing in a more commercial direction just as the football has been suffering.

You can't have a functioning attack unless the whole team is functioning properly. Attack and defence are not separate in football. If you can't sustain attacks and pressure on a team you will not create anything meaningful.

"Maybe you need to give yourself a few slappings  if you think this squad is anywhere near challenging for anything just because we‚Äôll add a new GK and CB in the summer. I‚Äôd rather sell Kane for 70+ and Son if we can get a decent fee and start building an actually strong squad. OP is absolutely right in the club trying to appease Kane by trying to shortcut their way to trophies. I want the old guard gone, that includes Kane and Son, rather do it now of our own accord and hopefully plan for it instead of it happening out of the club‚Äôs control (Kane leaving on a free next summer and age catching up to Son). 

We have waste the Kane&Son era, the sooner fans accept this the better. Now it‚Äôs time to move forward and get in a long term manager that plays on the front foot. I guarantee you that things will get worse before they get better, so better strap yourselves in.",Spurs,Yes,janj709,t1_janhwwt
"Potter literally rejected the job because he didn't want to ruin his reputation in a job where he won't get enough time before he joined Chelsea.

Add to that the fact that a lot of jobs might be open in the summer (Real, Bayern, Chelsea), we are not the bell of the ball we all consider ourselves.",Spurs,Yes,jalnhqf,t1_jalmrqe
"Very good point. We need more winners in the team, players that have played for clubs were there is constant pressure to perform. Bentancur was playing for Juventus since being a youngster and winning scudcettos, never goes missing and puts in consistently good performances, how many times has he been out MotM this season? I can think of maybe 2-3 actually bad performances since he‚Äôs been here. He knows what it takes to be a winner, so many of our players are fragile.",Spurs,Yes,jalp8ge,t1_jalojia
"I think Dele is a great example. I remember there were offers of around 80-90m, we ended up giving him away for free. I‚Äôm not implying that we should have sold him at his peak obviously, we should try to keep our best players. But once his drop off started and kept on going, we could have simply parted ways, we definitely could have gotten a good 30m for him at least, considering English tax. But no, Levy tried so hard to revive his career.

We are now wittinessing an almost 31 year old pacey winger have a complete drop off and looking a shadow of himself. The tactics and Persisic don‚Äôt help, but Son can‚Äôt control a football and beat a man for almost 3/4th of a whole season, you can‚Äôt claim that this is just a bad patch, none of us know that anymore considering how long this has been going on.

Yet if they were 2 brilliant matches we‚Äôd be judging him as the next big thing‚Ä¶ so it can work both ways. But yes I‚Äôll give it a few more games. Annoying that it was his defending that caused the goal though,Spurs,Yes,jao44y6,t1_janbmh7

It'll work this time!,Spurs,Yes,janlqhs,t1_janjeas
You could say the same thing about the FA cup. We could have lost to City or United in the semis or final. But weve made a CL final not too long ago and despite losing we gave ourselves a chance to win one of the biggest prizes. I think we have the possibility to win it especially this year as it seems a lot of top teams are a bit off. If we crash out against Milan then obviously this will make the FA cup loss look way worse.,Spurs,Yes,jan6xsg,t1_jan04zy
"Completely agree. 

Been a fan 29 years and it's just so stale now and not even the fun ups and downs of supporting a club.",Spurs,Yes,jan33oq,t1_jan0h5i
"Big chances is a specific stat with a specific definition. The PEH giveaway was a big chance for Sheffield‚Äîit‚Äôs basically a ‚Äúyou are expected to score from here‚Äù metric.

We had 17 shots. Those are lower case c chances. We had plenty of final third entries. Those are lower case c chances. We had plenty of set pieces around the area. Those are lower case c chances. I‚Äôm thinking of Lucas‚Äô cross/shot, Richy‚Äôs dipping shot that hit the post, Kane‚Äôs header near the end of the game, Perisic‚Äôs header from Son‚Äôs corner, etc.",Spurs,Yes,jam58ga,t1_jam3ufg
"He literally was our best player. I do think get this thing that when there's more than enough bad performance then people try and push it on to a player theu don't like.

"It 100% does but that‚Äôs what it‚Äôll take to win the league. [Look at Arsenal](https://twitter.com/premierleague/status/1630561870884093959?s=46&t=XEZVCgzh-hgq4b1KfYgjVA), they have two 1v1 specialists on either side and it‚Äôs no coincidence they‚Äôre thriving because of it

With almost every team playing a low block against the top teams, having dribblers is a must. We have 0 dribblers in our team",Spurs,Yes,jalj19l,t1_jalibbc
"Class third option, that",Spurs,Yes,jao4yvz,t1_jan50ps
"Saying they had a squad that nobody rated is crazy revision. Most people thought they were missing a striker and needed to shore up the defense, which they did by getting Saliba back from loan, adding Zinchenko, and getting Jesus.",Spurs,Yes,jamlham,t1_jalykcq

"I think the better option is to let his contract run and let him walk at the end of the season. Get the war chest back up and look at new options for more exciting and winning football. 

My bigger concern is if we don‚Äôt finish in a champions league spot one of the clauses in Kulusevski contract is that we finish in a CL spot for us to sign him. If we don‚Äôt get him - I think another club in the Prem will snap him up as he‚Äôs that good (thinking Man U or maybe Newcastle). That would be a big blow to us",Spurs,Yes,jan48tz,t1_jan3jkx
"I want him to stay. Get that summer where he gets backed to the fullest and then the fanbase can see why Conte is so reputed

The thing with him is he needs every single position to be perfect which is why he‚Äôs called a chequebook manager but we knew this already when we hired him

There are a good 5-6 positions we should upgrade on in GK, CB, LCB, LWB, LW at the very least and get depth in RCB, RW and CM. If we reinforce these positions this summer then we‚Äôd have insane success

I want to see one manager backed to the hilt before we give up on him. If we get in Poch, I‚Äôm 100% sure he‚Äôd do a good job and get backed way better than before but currently we‚Äôre just one solid window or two away from greatness under Conte",Spurs,Yes,janrk1y,t1_jan3jkx

"imo besides the thomas partey situation, woolwich and liverpool have tried to do it proper way. i agree about united though, they are just  a wannabe man city when it comes to spending.",Spurs,Yes,jamkqic,t1_jamkfeg
Exactly! Maybe Dier and Sanchez are shit. Maybe we should cancel their contracts today and send them off to Leyton Orient or something. But we didn't lose 5-3. We just couldn't score a goal against a team not even in our league. Why cant our expensively assembled front line not score a goal? Why does Kane (surely he leaves now!) have to do everything week after week.,Spurs,Yes,jaltj6a,t1_jalr1te
Did I say I care? It‚Äôs funny to me to see you incapable of learning,Spurs,Yes,jamobch,t1_jamnv82
I agree. He was overrated at Ajax. He looked the same as KMJ did in the Chinese league. KMJ only started actually looking really good in Fenerbahce. the difference was KMJ was always good on the ball even in China. KMJ was a beast in the korean league though.,Spurs,Yes,jamoqst,t1_jamnps7
"This place and I think sports fandom in general is emotional whiplash. I was so happy on Monday and then yesterday I was just bummed. I don't even really care about this weekend's game tbh, just want to see a good performance and win against Milan.",Spurs,Yes,jap67xr,t1_jap5eat
"Maybe you would. Club banter on the internet is just useless, who gives a shit it‚Äôs always going to be there",Spurs,Yes,jalikir,t1_jali32i

"Agreed. He‚Äôs a grind it out week in week out manager.  Tbf he‚Äôll most likely get us top 4 again and that is a significant achievement despite the criticism. But like all of us, I‚Äôd love a trophy and the FA cup is an achievable target.",Spurs,Yes,jall55z,t1_jalke7a
Disagree I'd say some of the most negative fans I've encountered are long-term fans. 22 years of disappointment is a lot and there is only so much someone can take. I'd say it's quite the opposite the more positive and patient fans I've met on here and in IRL are the newer fans because they don't know what's happened over the last 20 or so years.,Spurs,Yes,jalteey,t1_jalps2e
Good bot,Spurs,Yes,jalcuu3,t1_jalcp9l
Bad bot,Spurs,Yes,jalmcoc,t1_jalcp9l
"He didn't get everything that he wanted. But everyone that was paying attention during the transfer window can make the conclusion that he got the best that the club could realistically get.

We had a 60-70m offer for Lautaro accepted by Inter, only for them to back out of it in the end because they decided to sell Lukaku instead. Similar figure was accepted for Bastoni but he refused to leave Inter. Gvardiol didn't want to leave Leipzig either. It's clear that the money was there and the club was ready to splash big for Conte. He has ZERO ground to be upset for not being backed.

Nonetheless, all signings we made were met with positivity and it's unfathomable how pretty much all of them have been awful so far. The main responsibility for that for me falls on the manager.",Spurs,Yes,jam3afu,t1_jam0mpz
"Well perisic was clearly his signing. As was lenglet who he also tried to sign at Inter and talks up all the time. 

Richi the word was it was apparantly also his signing. And logically it checks out given I can't see Levy jumping to spend 60m on a rotation option. 

Only question marks is bissouma. Spence obviously wasn't.",Spurs,Yes,jam2fix,t1_jam0mpz
Oh fucking yawn.  Instead of just pissing your pants why don't you tell us exactly what should have been done?,Spurs,Yes,jaql0sc,t1_jan128f
you literally asked why we can't have both and stated that **every year** it is one or the other.,Spurs,Yes,jaoh6y0,t1_jaogozc
"Of course I do, I have been watching Spurs since 1988 and been to hundreds of games.  I feel it as acutely as anybody.

That said I don't let go of all rationality every time there is a bad result.  

We certainly are not worse than when Poch left as we were in freefall.  Mistakes have been made before and after that, but we have not been finished 8th like Arsenal either.  

You have to look at things over time, ie not 1-2 seasons, and clearly we have elevated our level significantly.  What is now required is some consistent strategy between recruitment and team management.  The board seem to be getting pilloried for having employed Mourinho and Conte, two of the most successful managers in the world and both PL winners, and for making signings at the level our club can currently afford.

Our biggest issue is the mistakes made in recruitment between 2017 and 2020.  We are still recovering and we will still be recovering even after this summer.  The reason the likes of Sanchez are still with us is because so many of our signings since became deadwood and have a massive ongoing cost.  We can't turn back time on that so we need to ride it out.

That said I don't believe we have the right manager, I hate the tactics, the performances and the dysfunctional attack.  We are putting together a good young squad and I can't see him being the guy to bring them through.",Spurs,Yes,janbbqt,t1_jan0ssl
"Again, I'm not sure what priority has anything to do with anything.

It definitely wasn't Man City's priority to win the Carabao cup every season yet they did it.

A professional player shouldn't need any additional motivation to win other than the fact they're playing a competitive football match",Spurs,Yes,jammxk8,t1_jamj80z
We looked pretty rough in the UCL matches too though.,Spurs,Yes,jamtdux,t1_jamj80z
"No need. I‚Äôve seen them all

The truth is that we don‚Äôt have the depth to win these competitions. This time of year when the cups are decided, we are always in a race for top 4 and so it‚Äôs natural that we play rotated teams. And our rotated teams are far inferior than Liverpool‚Äôs, City‚Äôs, Chelsea‚Äôs etc",Spurs,No,jaltvtp,t1_jalt3ce
"Aye, I feel like anyone surprised or upset by our B team bombing out of the FA cup against lower league opposition hasn't supported us long enough to be immune to it yet, or just allows the hope to kill them. 

Whole thing just feels like ""meh"" to me. Briefly disappointed but not surprised. We needed to rotate and our rotation teams never get enough playtime to be match-sharp or develop a good understanding. 

If we can make top 4 and go into next season with the new signings properly bedded in (which takes a long time, plenty of players and managers put it at 12-18 months), I'll be happy.",Spurs,Yes,jamwjps,t1_jamojjq
"fair enough. I think I would feel much better if this club was going in a rebuild situation. I'd have much lower expectations if we went under a rebuilding manager and sold Kane and sold Son and just tried to build from the ground up again. That was enjoyable. I just hate wasting Kane and Son at this club man. Yes they have problems themselves, but they should be given more chances to play in cup finals. We shouldn't have to start Kane against Sheffield man if we are a good side.

I'm tired.....",Spurs,Yes,jamp5uh,t1_jamojjq
'Likewise'?,Spurs,Yes,jaoe4cj,t1_jaodksj
"On a personal opinion side, I'm not sure we don't have that now, we just haven't been successful at it.

Aside from that, again, without the new owners being a magic sportwashing slush fund, the overwhelming likelihood of any new owner is investment fund with less personal ties to the club than ENIC and Levy. New owner's aren't magically plunking down billions with no regard for the investment.

You can say ""owner that prioritizes football"" til you're blue in the face, but where's the queue of them?",Spurs,Yes,janlapr,t1_janjfvu
Can you give an example of that that's operating at the moment that isn't a sportswashing operation?,Spurs,Yes,janq4oy,t1_janjfvu
"Who gives a fuck at all about F1 or bungee jumping? I said absolutely nothing about them. Either you genuinely think that the people involved in the F1 deal or bungee jumping were neglecting football related duties to get those things done, and you're being silly, or you know they're separate activities and you're just being disingenuous. 

Should Levy be out of making football decisions, or should he be focused on football decisions? Which is it? Because we don't like when he's involved, and when he does other things (that pump money into the football) we wield them as criticisms.

Are we trying to make sense, or just trying to have something to point fingers at? Do you think City doesn't have commercial revenue? Madrid? Bayern? Barca? Arsenal? Liverpool? No, you don't think that because of fucking course they do. 

None of this has anything to do with our lack of success on the pitch, and it's such a transparently bullshit argument. I don't even like go karts or bungee jumping, or give a fuck what our commercial revenue is, it's just so incredibly stupid to be mad at it and scapegoat it.",Spurs,Yes,jao7wq9,t1_janw627
"> a dumb spend happy non state affiliated billionaire

Because billionaires aren't traditionally dumb and spend happy. Again, where's the line of billionaires who don't give a shit about anything but winning waiting to buy football clubs? They're not here. They're not anywhere. It's all investment firms.",Spurs,Yes,jao8dny,t1_jantlbt

"You're welcome.

 I want Conte to stay, lots think he's shit, those are sporting opinions, who cares about differing. Potter's weak and his teams don't score, maybe someday I'll be proven wrong.

"I wish I could deliver poor results for 20 years and be rewarded for my poor performance by consistently awarding myself more and more money for my poor performance

"I don't understand your point? What does Potter 2 years ago have to do with now if he's sacked by Chelsea? Its a completely different situation.

We've git enough to worry about without inventing extra scenarios!",Spurs,Yes,jalp0u5,t1_jalnhqf
"It was Bentancur's performance that got us over the line in Marseille when we were heading toward a very similar fate to last night. He is the one who drove the team forward with his pressing and intensity.

"I agree that Son is having a drop off, but we should have sold Dele when he had value. Son doesn't have value right now. I don't see teams offering much money for Son. But we could have sold Dele for like 30+ million for many years so I get what you are saying there.",Spurs,Yes,jama2ok,t1_jalotv7

"I know what the stat means. 

A shot is not a chance. That's mad. 

We created an XG of 0.8, 0.2 of that was kanes header at the end where the cross was so weak and lofted that it was pretty much impossible to get enough power to beat a keeper.

"True, but they were both lucky to be amongst the top teams back when the PL and CL was formed, thus benefiting more than others from those money injections. 

After that there really has only been one way to achieve success. It‚Äôs the same across all European countries and it‚Äôs boring. We see the same teams from the same leagues competing at the top year in year out and it‚Äôs been like this for 3 decades.

I‚Äôm old enough to remember the time before that and it was a lot more fun to watch domestic and European competitions.

We are only getting top four cause Liverpool and Chelsea fucked up. Next season if Conte plays the same grind, we will be battered like we usually are. Conte tbf has proved that despite his past success, managers have evolved and teams that are much more dynamic   tend to win the most. Even the few tactical masterclasses this season have been when Conte was out in Italy. Personally I think Conte has been the worst tactician of the top teams this season. He got schooled by his compatriots Tuchel (we got lucky) and Arteta. And the same will happen with ETH.",Spurs,Yes,jalllc3,t1_jall55z
Yeah just take a look at WeAreTottenhamTV are having a meltdown.,Spurs,Yes,jalu5f7,t1_jalteey
"I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs elements of both, but I personally believe it‚Äôs more new fans that are overly negative. I think a lot of them got on board around the UCL final and seem to expect that kind of thing to be the norm. 

As someone who has been a fan for around 20 years, my personal view is that while the football and the results have been disappointing, where we are as a club compared to 20 years ago is far far better. We‚Äôve gone from being potential relegation candidates to featuring in the champions league pretty regularly. 

It seems to me that many new fans want to compare our success against the likes of Man City, whereas a lot of older fans compare our success to how shit we really used to be.",Spurs,Yes,jaluaor,t1_jalteey
I'm not defending him or making him a victim. But I also think the narratives pushed about these transfers when they were happening clearly was misleading.

"I don't think any of that is obvious at all apart from Perisic. There's also a big difference between actively wanting a player to come and just accepting their arrival. Maybe he was cool with someone like Lenglet coming but he absolutely was not ""exactly what he wanted"" after months of links to Bastoni.

In terms of stature over the last decade, upwards. Conte is not a manager who would've even looked at our direction five years ago. In terms of results, around the same. Looks like another 4-5th place finish this year. Next year I couldn't even make a prediction because of the Conte situation.

* They sold their most experienced midfielder to sign a young kid with half a season in Europe who can't even speak english for 120m in January when the team was crying out for stability. 
* Their fans have been booing Cucurella, who is the most expensive full back in football history, and he couldn't even make the matchday squad against us.
* They left Aubameyang out of their UCL squad and multiple PL squads and have now brought him back.
* They left their shiny new CB out of the UCL squad and now their best CB is injured. 
* They paid 100m for a kid from Ukraine who has basically done nothing in his career and was begging for a transfer to Arsenal but has ended up at Chelsea and has looked totally off it. 
* The dressing room is a disaster for all the above reasons. I can't even begin to fathom how toxic it must be. 
* They have scored 6 goals in 5 months.

* DM: Bissouma, Skipp, Bentancur
* B2B CM: Hojbjerg, Sarr

Even though Rodrigo has chipped in with goals and assists this season I still see him as more of a defensive midfielder. He doesn't have the same eye for a pass as Pierre. Also, Hojbjerg himself is probably naturally more of a DM himself, he's just asked to contribute more to the attack in this system. 

I think we should be targeting another B2B CM next who has good attacking output as well as being able to cover a lot of ground, pressing and having solid defensive traits. Someone like Milinkovic-Savic would be perfect. He is also aerially extremely dominant and wins a lot of duels. His attacking output is also fantastic. Bring him in and let Sarr go out on a good loan next season.",Spurs,No,jah4qlf,t3_11evyek

Next season we have to transition to a 352 with attacking fullbacks instead of 343 with defensive fullbacks. Udogie and Porro are perfect for the roles. Son Kane Richarlison Deki rotating for the front two spots and Hojbjerg Bentancur Skippy midfield - none of whom can be dropped. Bissouma and Sarr for cover.,Spurs,No,jaimbsr,t3_11evyek

"I was pro-Potter to begin with.  Not his transfer window, and lots of injuries... seemed like there was little he could do.

But surely the recent run of results have to be on him.  Conte started archieving things within a few weeks, also without a pre-season, transfers window, and a half-baked squad.

Conte had some kind of plan, and if that meant dropping good players who didn't fit the plan, so be it.  Same with Ten Hag.  It's not clear what Potter's plan is at all.",Spurs,Yes,jagwx73,t1_jagsyev

"I'm ""Conte in"" until the end of the season and then I don't care. He's a good manager and maybe with time we can fire on all cylinders, but if someone else that's a better fit is available, I wouldn't be mad. I just don't see the point in doing anything now, especially that it's clear that all the ownership wants is to win the Arsene Wenger Memorial Top 4 Trophy 2 years out of 3.

I really cannot understand why we do not put strong teams in cup games. It's not like we haven't been shit in the league at random anyway.  But that's not Conte, that's been even before Poch.

And speaking of which, I'm not Poch in. There's a lot of rose colored glasses there. Same people who want him back will argue in the same sentence that one of Conte's irredeemable flaws was he can't make subs. Anyone who was actually paying attention when Poch was here knows he was shit and late with the subs.

It would be cool if he came back and we started winning stuff, like a movie, but I just don't think he's the best we can do.",Spurs,Yes,jal14t7,t1_jak0og9
">For the people that are Conte in, please tell me why.

Because he has the highest points per game of any manager in our history? And the fact that we're 4th even though we have the 6th highest wage bill which is the most accurate predictor of success. The fact is Conte is overperforming in the competitions Levy has prioritised.",Spurs,Yes,jakeryg,t1_jak0og9
Honestly I would rather us not finish top 4 than see side ways passing rest of the season.,Spurs,Yes,jak26f2,t1_jak0og9
"There isn‚Äôt any coach in world football that‚Äôs realistically available that has done what he‚Äôs done  

I remember all y‚Äôall nutting over Graham Potter as the perfect ‚Äúproject manager‚Äù and look how that‚Äôs going - for all the dickriding Ten Hag gets he‚Äôs only 4 points ahead with a squad that maybe two Spurs players would get into on a good day",Spurs,Yes,jak6jbf,t1_jak0og9
">but how to you explain us getting embarrassed by championship sides and bottom table PL clubs this season

I thought we always did this though",Spurs,Yes,jaknf35,t1_jak0og9
"Because if I look at the distribution of managers better than Conte and managers worse than Conte one side of the graph is bigger than the other.

For every Conte there a dozen Nuno‚Äôs. 

I‚Äôd rather stick with Conte too long than not long enough. 

And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs been long enough yet.",Spurs,Yes,jakauu0,t1_jak0og9
"Because the club needs a change, and this point the biggest change the club can do is give a world class manager time. Everyone in this sub wants us to be the next Liverpool, but are not willing to give the manager the time to make his team.

Add to that, why would a manager come to spurs after seeing that Antonio freaking Conte is getting sacked after about a year and a half.

If Conte leaves on his own, than I can certainly understand, but if not, there is no point in getting a new manager because even they won't get the time and the cycle will continue.",Spurs,Yes,jak9h7g,t1_jak0og9
"I don‚Äôt see how changing Conte fixes the underlying issues. It just puts a new mask on the same problems. I don‚Äôt necessarily think it‚Äôs the ownership either. There isn‚Äôt a winning culture in the club right now, and it hasn‚Äôt been in place since the CL final. We would find ourselves back in the same place two years (or less) from now if we got a new manager. We‚Äôve seen the tactics work. We‚Äôve seen great play out of this team. It‚Äôs much more complex than replacing the manager.",Spurs,Yes,jakjq3k,t1_jak0og9
"Yeah because it gives us results until it didnt. I expect to find courtesy within others so he lasts the season no matter what happens.

We can play all the beautiful football we want but we'll probably end up with the twilight of Pochs reign which to be honest wasnt that good results-wise either

See the big problem is the man upstairs and nobody seems to care because morality excuses and whatever hogwash",Spurs,Yes,jal4isg,t1_jak0og9
">  of which two aren‚Äôt even clear downgrades in Son and Sarr for Richarlison and Skipp/Hojbjerg. 

Porro for Emerson as well. This kind of match could suit him very well, playing against weaker opposition that will perhaps try to sit back.",Spurs,Yes,jagub2t,t1_jagqf3o
"Especially as one of the aces up our sleeve is fitness.  It's the back end of the season, other squads are tiring, but we are not.  That's one of the whole points of Conte's regime.  We shouldn't need to rotate to rest.",Spurs,Yes,jagx1q9,t1_jagqf3o
"> Didn‚Äôt we learn anything from Middlesbrough last year?

We played pretty close to full strength last year, with the only real change being Bentancur not even in the squad for some reason. 

Personally I think it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect us to go with anything but full strength against Wolves, I just can‚Äôt see Conte doing it, unless it‚Äôs to rest people for Milan. I do think he‚Äôll go pretty strong tonight: I expect Kane to start, and most of our changes to ones that don‚Äôt drastically lower the quality, at least in his eyes. My main concern is that he gets that RHS wrong. I think it‚Äôs reasonably likely Porro starts, but I can definitely see Romero being benched, and Tanganga seems to have Been favoured over Sanchez recently, and I can‚Äôt see Tanganga and Porro not being a liability. However I think Royal and Sanchez or even Tanganga leaving us lacking on that side as well, so I just hope it‚Äôs either Royal Romero or Porro Romero/Sanchez.",Spurs,Yes,jagtsk0,t1_jagqf3o
"Yeah we should be in full force probably more than Wolves fixture, NO RAGRETS",Spurs,Yes,jagqnso,t1_jagqf3o
Yeah I agree. I think we could try Danjuma on the RW though to give Kulu a much needed rest.,Spurs,Yes,jagr8yk,t1_jagqf3o
I'm not even confident in Lloris' shot stopping ability these days. He literally gifted Arsenal two goals across both derbies and failed to stop Odegaard's shot across the ground which was saveable. Could have gotten something out of both games if not for Lloris' clangers. There's various other games where his shot stopping has failed us this season too.,Spurs,Yes,jahku30,t1_jaharhp
"Modric is that guy! He would be our Casemiro impact signing. We already have decent DMs in hojbjerg and Skipp and even Bissouma. I would love to get Modric.

"Modric is too important to Madrid for him to come back, Bale was surplus to requirements for years before we got him on loan",Spurs,Yes,jaiht6k,t1_jahplsu
Think it‚Äôs not a bad idea to start Sanchez or tanganga instead of Dier. They need game time and Dier will miss the 2nd leg against Milan anyways so this is a good opportunity for them to get some game time beforehand.,Spurs,Yes,jai2bo0,t1_jahpma1

Between him and Moura I'd guess,Spurs,Yes,jahp7as,t1_jahdziq
"There's also been tactical changes. He's now driving to the center, instead of overlapping deki on the line, also no more crosses, unless it's the last option (one of those should have been a Kane goal and an assist for him)",Spurs,Yes,jagvw1s,t1_jaglpr5
">It wasn‚Äôt a gradual improvement, it was like someone flicked a switch.

There were signs. Towards the back end of last season he had some really good showings once Doherty was injured, I seem to remember Liverpool away being one of them. Then for whatever reason he started this season really poorly, which is why I'm not getting carried away with this current spell and am still very glad we got Porro. But the important thing is we know he has this level of performance in him and he's still young, it's just about delivering it consistently now. And as someone else mentioned Kulu coming back has definitely been a factor as they combine very well.",Spurs,Yes,jagsoot,t1_jaglpr5
"Je was always really good defensively, and has always been decent at little 1 2s and short passes. People forget he was starting every game of the run in when we were great last season and he was good. 

When deki got injured though he had to play more out on the touchline and crossing and beating a man aren't his skills. So he looked rubbish. 

Deki coming back has been the key.",Spurs,Yes,jagmf95,t1_jaglpr5
"I think its down to the nickname royalzhino, because he has been super ever since. Like he is trying to play up to the standards of the name.",Spurs,Yes,jags8gy,t1_jaglpr5

Although with the abolishment of the away goal rule, giving up one isn‚Äôt a death sentence, so maybe going for it with Porro shows more balls",Spurs,Yes,jagq6zw,t1_jagoy0x
Milan's strength is their left side ... So we need our best defensive fullback. Emerson is clearly that.,Spurs,Yes,jagtvvv,t1_jagoy0x
"Not sure there is any debate here.  Even if Emerson wasn't on great form (he is), he is there to run a block against strong teams while Porro is supposed to unlock weaker and defensive teams.

The surprise was Emerson against West Ham.   Likewise, Porro might expect to start against Wolves, so that is more of a question than Milan.",Spurs,Yes,jagx740,t1_jagoy0x
Emerson. We are only one nil down so we dont have to go gung ho. Also Milan really are not anything special this year. The gamw plan should be the same as always to stay solid and don't give away any great opportunitues to them and take our chances when presented and we should be through,Spurs,Yes,jagpwvt,t1_jagoy0x

He has settled at Madrid in his decade there becoming a club legend with guaranteed Champions League football every season, he‚Äôs almost on 400k a week as it is, which is more than Kane‚Äôs salary by a factor of 1.25. This would totally break our wage structure and we wouldn‚Äôt cash out that much for a 37 year old.",Spurs,Yes,jai0y8n,t1_jahxoex
"Bro our least weakest position is CM. Sorry to burst your bubble but it isn‚Äôt an extra ordinary CM that‚Äôs going to propel us to a title challenge

It‚Äôs an insane CB that will

Which isn‚Äôt Modric",Spurs,Yes,jaijg1s,t1_jahxoex
"Strange that you think our midfield options are poor long-term; it's the part of the squad I'm most comfortable with. Hojberg is the most senior player and is 27. Skipp and Sarr seem like real talents too, and we've White coming up through the ranks, who by all accounts could be a world-beater. And that's ignoring Bentancur and Bissouma!

Agreed that we need to strengthen our CBs. However, think we need to think our GK strategy through a bit more though, I wouldn't mind us paying over the odds for a good keeper as they are so so so important. Get that right and we're sorted for another decade. Get the CB right and we're sorted for a season or three.",Spurs,Yes,jah4d2w,t1_jah2bk0
Feel like we need to have a backup/ younger replacement for son as he is only going to start slowing down in pace. Still think he is an amazing player just feel like he is going to start losing the pace that made him so go on the counter attack.,Spurs,Yes,jah3rj5,t1_jah2bk0
">  Also, Hojbjerg himself is probably naturally more of a DM himself

No he isn't, when we bought him to play a DM Southampton fans told us it's a bad fit for him, and that he's a B2B",Spurs,Yes,jah512v,t1_jah4qlf

"Potter hasn't been at all helped by the ownership. He has been placed into an impossible situation that is only going to begin getting sorted in the summer when they get rid of at least 10 players. 

But at the same time, he doesn't inspire any confidence at all and seems unable to get anything out of his players. He looks totally out of depth. Experience at the top level is really important.

Very few managers make the step up into a big job like that without having either played for a top team or managed one.",Spurs,Yes,jaguf86,t1_jagtsz7
"Oh yeah for sure. Boehly and co have destroyed the entire infrastructure at Chelsea. They changed far too much far too quickly, both off the pitch and on it.",Spurs,Yes,jagvchc,t1_jagv76g
"He doesn't have a plan. It's been months, and he still has no idea what his matchday squad should look like. He's having them play a style that clearly doesn't suit the players' abilities and refuses/is unable to have them play any other way despite months of poor results. As Robbie Earle said on the US broadcast, the players look like they've already quit on him.

Yet you still have people defending the job he's doing and making excuses for him (likely because he's the young English fancystats guy). The latest one is how he just needs more time to get all the new players to work together. Forrest replaced basically their entire squad this year, yet it didn't take Steve Cooper nearly as long to get his team working together and playing the way he wanted.",Spurs,Yes,jahgpx3,t1_jagwx73
Ego and arrogance will be their downfall. They seem to believe they can do no wrong. They have not even considered that these players could flop and what will happen if they do.,Spurs,Yes,jagx374,t1_jagvxfe
"It's not about being rated. If you come in to a club in January you need to start playing straight away without much training. The least you need to be able to do is understand what your manager is telling you and communicate with your team mates. 

It's easier in the summer when you can assimilate with your team mates, pick up on the language a bit and learn from training sessions.",Spurs,Yes,jaguplw,t1_jaguif8

"Not really. It just shows the fine margins in football and how 1 or 2 matches can change entire narratives. 

Our results against the rest of the league are exactly the same as Arsenal - yet they are talked about as the best team in Europe and we are having an awful season! And that is all down to 2 games.",Spurs,Yes,jagv8lw,t1_jagpovw

Not much of a boy at 45.  But understand not everyone can stay positive.,Spurs,Yes,jahnk16,t1_jahkt62
"Agree. Losing a one off league match to any opposition is only 3 points dropped out of 114 at the end of the day, but we genuinely have a really good chance of silverware in this competition right now considering there are only 2 teams left I think we'd lose to in a final",Spurs,Yes,jahqgt8,t1_jahlecg
"I‚Äôm not having that either, his ball winning and the way he helps compress the pitch by getting so tight is key to us actual keeping possession higher up the pitch",Spurs,Yes,jaltojn,t1_jakss78
Bad fit for this system...like so many other players it seems,Spurs,Yes,jak6h00,t1_jak40xh
"The real problem is he‚Äôs not a great passer, which is fine when he‚Äôs surrounded by passers but not when flanked by Lucas and Son",Spurs,Yes,jakfsyc,t1_jak6nt0

"I don't really know what you mean?

I'm aware Eccleshare is an arsenal fan but hes very positive about spurs and at the very keast doesn't act like covering the club is a chore that gets in the way for him!

My point on Spiers beign a Wolves fan is I can't think of a more depressing club to cover/follow than them. You would have thought he'd be delighted to get away from that for half a season.",Spurs,Yes,jai5k7f,t1_jai533d
"Yeah absolutely. Spiers is obvs a good journo but deary me just try and be a bit positive and cater to your audience a bit

He said we aren't comparable to UTD beciase if you take out kanes goals we would be midtable....despite the fact if you take out rashfords goals, UTDs 2nd and 3rd highest scorers have less goals than our 2nd and 3rd highest.",Spurs,Yes,jai681z,t1_jai4v2z
Yeah. His tactical analysis is really good but on the pods and stuff it really comes across like he's looking to just stick the knife in wherever possible!,Spurs,Yes,jai7e4a,t1_jai5pt2
"Even aside from the fact he seems to hate covering the club, Spiers just has so much less charisma than Charlie as well.

"Have you listened to the Athletic Football podcast this week with Chappers? It's a spurs special one and honestly as you say it's like he's got a gripe against the club or something. JPB almost feels like he's sticking up for the club by the end of it.

It's basically like how I would cover Arsenal so maybe he just doesn't like spurs! And I know this all makes me sound like a whiney little bitch but it is a but taxing to listen to when you pay money to do so!",Spurs,Yes,jai6uwt,t1_jai6hmt
"You know what mate you may have actually hut the nail on the head here. 

Originally I was thinking that maybe Daniel Levy had denied him a parking permit or something, but maybe its just his schtick and his way if doing things.

"It‚Äôs really the stubbornness to not even consider mixing things up that I find frustrating.

Knowing that the system hasn‚Äôt worked well when we have to create, he has shown zero flexibility in adjusting his tactics.

And personally the final draw was him starting Son + Perisic again. That combo has clearly not worked all season, and we finally seemed to come alive a little. Knowing how critical that position is, why go back to what never worked?

Yes, we need to replace a lot of players and rebuild. But given Conte‚Äôs stubbornness, I have zero confidence he‚Äôs the man for the job unless the board is willing to pour hundreds of millions and get the exact world class players in Conte‚Äôs mold.",Spurs,Yes,jala4gu,t1_jakjq3k

"Absolutely. After the summer we had, I‚Äôve stopped caring about top 4. We didn‚Äôt bring in a single game changer, our best transfer in the past 5 years was when we were in ECL (Romero) and when we got knocked out embarrassingly and weren‚Äôt sniffing at top 4 (Kulu and Benta).

"Hahaha, I‚Äôve mainly ended up in this position because I live close to Sheffield and I‚Äôve never had chance to see a Spurs game (I can‚Äôt afford it basically).

"Yeah I know its very annoying. 

Guardian pod literally did all Chelsea for 20 mins, which was all very similar to when Chelsea lost to saints anyway. And the only thing they mentioned was Skipp looks older than he is, and someone said he was just a solid player.

He has a very poor Sonny and similarly poor form Kulu (or Moura who is just shit)

you are absolutely right. Sanchez and Dier today..... Relegation backline. Now you know why I rate Romero so much. He at worst is a top half CB. We need any kind of quality.  GIVE me Zabaryni now!

"I mean I know we are mocking right now but I reckon long term Enzo would be magnificent for Chelsea once he adapts, add the likes of Rice/Caicedo/Bellingham joining our rivals then our midfield clearly pales with respect to them.

"Mourinho would be fine with these players imo

First of all, Son would still be firing, I physically can‚Äôt believe what Conte has done with him this season

Kane goes back to creator/playmaker instead of jogging 5 miles a match

Romero is a proper world class CB, exactly what he was missing

Perisic is experienced and he‚Äôs wanted him before

Bentancur is a quality midfielder, Skipp is more developed, and these two are better than Winkssoko. Even then Bissouma is another option

Richarlison is exactly the kind of ‚Äúintelligent cunt‚Äù he likes and actual backup for Kane

Kulusevski gives him an actual useful player on the right wing, great work rate and hold-up play

Royal is a good defensive fullback, miles better than Aurier who conceded a penalty or dangerous FK every other game

Even Lenglet is better than our CB options from that season


Our current squad suits him more than his actual one

Idk why every manager we hire insists on Dier tho",Spurs,Yes,jajq8m1,t1_jajoyu3

Agreed the service wasn't great but his link up play was non existent. Constantly falling over or trying ambitious flicks around the corner to nobody. He was miles off it.,Spurs,Yes,jajns54,t1_jajnffh
"At the time nobody was saying it was a 4. Point me to your comments at the time saying it was a 4.

I was underwhelmed with not getting in a proven RWB but even then I was pretty content, as was basically everyone here. Bissouma was a good signing for a great price, nobody could tell he would suddenly forget how to play football. I still think he will come good. Likewise Richarlison - at the time I wanted Jesus but I wasn't disappointed at the Richy transfer, he's a PL proven attacker who starts for Brazil and in theory provided backup for any of our front 3. Again nobody could foresee him falling off a cliff. Perisic was one of the world's best LWBs and already played under Conte. Lenglet and Spence low risk backups with high potential upside. It's very easy to criticise in hindsight.

Also look at 2021 - that is now looking like a 7/10 window minimum with Emerson and Sarr now performing, Gil the only blot. There's a decent chance the same thing happens with this last summer's window.",Spurs,Yes,jakgnh8,t1_jak7t6j

"the point was depth. It seems everyone forgot what was the talking points end of last season, and that's fair, this season has been long and disastrous. The talking points at the end of last season were that our XI was good, except for the wingback positions and we just needed more depth. That's why we spunked 150M on these depth signings + Perisic which Conte then proceeded to barely integrate with the exception of Perisic.  
However, there was a solid group of people that were unhappy with our January window, specifically over the lack of big name signings. They were probably right given how now the talking points are that our signings suck and our starting XI isn't good enough.",Spurs,Yes,jajumt3,t1_jajoaj2

I would love to upgrade.  Bring on Bastoni or Gvardiol... hell I want them both.  But right now, it doesn't seem that is practical solution for the Club, even if we as fans want it.",Spurs,Yes,jaiqowv,t1_jaioo5g

"From a managerial perspective, I think we missed out on not trusting Poch and then Mou as well. Conte last season played the Mourinho way with two new additions and some tweaks. I guess backing Mou would have been a better choice in the long run. Conte this season is trying to play his own way and failing spectacularly so far. It wont be wrong to say that we play the worst football in EPL. Anyway I don't expect to win trophies supporting Spurs. Gave up that dream a long time ago. I just want to see some decent football.

He shouldn't have gotten sacked in the first place so I get it. I'm just worried man, ENIC has shown me before they won't back Poch.",Spurs,Yes,jai1q19,t1_jai05nx

Bentancur is by far our best midfielder. When PEH is in it he‚Äôs great, but we‚Äôve seen his form go up and down many times. Bentancur gives you consistently good performances.

"I've found the simplest way to see if a player, especially if it's a defender, is any good or not in terms of technical ability.

It's just looking at what they do when under pressure when they have the ball at their feet or have a free header. You watch players like a Thiago Silva or Lisandro Martinez and they always calmly pass to a teammate and work their way out of trouble the vast majority of the time.

Then you watch Dier and Davies and Sanchez and my eyes bleed. Open headers, time on the ball and they just hoof horrible long balls or head it straight to the opposition",Spurs,Yes,jajxa61,t1_jajwo4r

Levy could find a player and the team/player just may not want to deal.  Fiorentina seem set to keep Milenkovic.

Maybe a player wants to stay in a certain league/country.  Take them out of the population. Many players just stay in their home leagues (see bayern).

I'd imagine Levy also isnt looking for guys who are on the wrong side of 30 otherwise why not try to keep Toby around?  So take out them, too.

The pool of players that fit what would be most ideal starts to get really small, really quick.  Just saying it never as simple as we want it to be.  You can choose to accept that or not.

"That sounds like a plan cheers, I‚Äôll have a look when I get chance at lunch for some tickets and I‚Äôll message back here. Failing that, it‚Äôll be up the spurs for me against Milan haha. 

Thanks again, better keep an eye out for games closer to me in the future a lot sooner, help to get my points up.",Spurs,Yes,jagqo17,t1_jagqf2e
I think they might have looked worse against Palace,Spurs,Yes,jair2tc,t1_jaiqw5t
"To be blunt with you, to get in for a chance at away games, you first need a season ticket when you said you cant make it to London often. And then you need to attend most cup home games for about 4 years to even start scraping the points cut-off for some games.",Spurs,Yes,jagr0y3,t1_jagqo17
