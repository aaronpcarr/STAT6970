"Looking at the transfer talk in here, I am starting to realize just how strange our situation will be this summer.

This summer, regardless of if we finish 1st or 2nd, we will have more ""brand equity"" and ""market pull"" than we have had in over a decade or more. We are a young club, with what will be viewed as a top manager, in the top league, while teams like Chelsea and Liverpool look out of sorts and wont have the CL to sway potential transfer targets. 

Combined with our financial prudence this past winter and the increase in revenues that are to come, we will have more opportunities to strengthen our team than ever before. I've been looking forward to being in this position for a long time. 

At this point though, I was expecting Xhaka to still be bang average, to have a lack of a permanent RB, and the LW and CF positions clearly needing upgrades. Instead, Xhaka has had a late career renaissance (can we depend on this?), Ben White has shown great at RB for 3/4 of a season (can we depend on this?) Martinelli and Jesus have been great but the former has clear limitations when patient play is needed, and the latter still has a question mark regarding true goal scoring ability. Not to mention Partey has been a huge cog for us but... well you know.

The huge fork in the road, and a decision that will likely echo on for many years to come, is how much we change vs. how much we keep constant this summer. Unfortunately (or probably fortunately) our starting XI seems to have no clear weak spots to improve, despite also having maybe only one or two players that would be considered world class by typical (sometimes stupid) standards.  

It is hard to argue we need a world class player to step in to any of our starting XI positions at present, yet how many of our starting XI are we truly 100% comfortable with playing in UCL knockout rounds (should we get there) while battling the top x teams in the EPL come the 2nd half of next season? 

If we don't spend, and certain players like Xhaka/Martinelli/Gabriel/Jesus drop off next year... then it is possible the following summer we no longer have UCL football and no longer have the ""brand equity"" we have this offseason. At that point, we may not be able to attract the high-level quality of players we need.

However, if we buy top quality players to fight for spots with our starting XI this summer, how will it effect our team chemistry and the confidence of players like Martinelli, Jesus, Gabriel, Xhaka, etc...",Arsenal,No,jf4pxjv,t3_12ccqs3

"I suspect potter had little to no say on the transfers they went with considering they just kept overpaying for strikers. 

I would imagine that lack of control will put a lot of coaches off.

"He‚Äôs their Willian, a senior player the manager knows to pin down one end while they clean up the others. 

Their plan is very similar to ours so far, but fortunately their marquee winger Antony isn‚Äôt very good. Think Lisandro is alright? 

So they have a rebuild as big as ours to do, but without anything like Wengz‚Äôs best gift to us: a functioning Hale End that gave us a few free hits in ESR, Saka and Eddie (their best internal solution had other career interests). However they do have infinite money and influence glitch going for them. 

So really the next season is pivotal for this iteration of their ‚Äúproject‚Äù. If their signings in summer work, they have some foundation to build else they have even more deadwood and the comedy will continue.",Arsenal,Yes,jf2euzu,t1_jf20umh
"The thing that worries me is that the more Liverpool are under pressure the better they play (at home).

Bournemouth away? Utterly fucked

"City take 1.9 points per game from away games. They have dropped points in 43% of their away games this season. They have a goal difference of 12.

In contrast, they gave 2.6 ppg at home with a GD of 33. They've dropped points in 14% of home games.

There is a massive difference in City home and away.

This is why I don't understand people's perception that City will go the rest of the season unbeaten. Their away form isn't great and they tend to perform worse after playing in midweek.",Arsenal,Yes,jf1dd2v,t1_jf1c32o
"They call it the emptihad for a reason. 

It‚Äôs also probably not a coincidence that Artetas focus was making the emirates like anfield.

I would imagine all these things are related.",Arsenal,Yes,jf1ccld,t1_jf1c32o
"Man City are very knew club. Their longer term fans would still recall the times they were managed by Stuart Pearce, but I doubt the new fans would realise Kevin De Bruyne shares the record for Winning City player of the year award with ‚Ä¶.Richard Dunne, who have both won 4 each. 

They are unveiling statues of Kompany, Ageuro, Silva and likely more modern players, I heard Yaya Toure might get one. But you sure as fuck won‚Äôt see any scenery of Man City prior to 2009 around the Etihad.

"Trossard has done nothing wrong to be benched to be honest. Actually, he might be the best crosser of the ball among our attackers and creates a ton of chances that way by pinging in dangerous crosses into the box every time.

Him and Martinelli constantly swapping the left and centre could really destroy Liverpool.

I'd still start Martinelli-Trossard-Saka and bring Jesus on later. A fresh Jesus later on in the game could cause chaos for Liverpool.",Arsenal,Yes,jf1fqan,t1_jf16s17

"Still mad they lost that game. It was a bad draw in my books. 

But then, it's their antidote. They look lost when you decide to have the ball and know how to hide it. They look insane vs coward teams because they have every tool to break a bus or overwhelm you. That's why with better finishing and a referee favor at the end, we win too. City just punished them better.",Arsenal,Yes,jf459nf,t1_jf3wsrg
"I dont think they are even that bothered. We said the same thing a year ago. It was ""bad"" they were losing Bissouma, but a year later Caicedo is 10x the player, worth 3x as much and they made good money off of Yves.

Cucarella also looked amazing for them and the ¬£60m they got for him now looks among the best business done by a selling team.",Arsenal,Yes,jf4h6sk,t1_jf49fdr
"I think Ferguson will probably stay, because he‚Äôs very young and is all but promised a major role he can use to develop at Brighton. He has plenty of time to make a move later. I know Brighton fans see Buonanotte as a replacement for Mac Allister‚Äôs inevitable departure. Idk what they‚Äôll do about the other two, but I recently saw an interview with (iirc) their director of football who talked about how they recruit and I got the impression they‚Äôd probably do a good job of finding replacements. Obviously you‚Äôd expect the well to run dry eventually, but maybe their scouting, recruitment, and development is good enough to avoid a Southampton situation",Arsenal,Yes,jf4b5di,t1_jf49fdr
I mean Salah is always god against us and not to mention jota,Arsenal,Yes,jf109ip,t1_jf0z32b
"I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more Martinelli or Trossard, rather than Jesus. I tend to default to Martinelli, but I wonder if Trossards chance creation gives him the edge in such an important game.",Arsenal,Yes,jf17h71,t1_jf16ui8
Start Jesus sub in trossard. Yes trossard has been amazing but Jesus is different gravy and has looked super hungry.,Arsenal,Yes,jf16zqs,t1_jf16ui8
"Trossard has to start.  He‚Äôs been one of our best players  and been consistently delivering since he joined.  He does not deserve to be dropped.

You can‚Äôt just drop form players because the other player ‚Äúlooks hungry‚Äù or because of what we saw they were capable of 6 months ago.  You keep playing the form player until they give you reason to drop them.  Otherwise you have man management problems.

Besides, having the ability to sub on a full energy Jesus for the last 30 minutes against Liverpool‚Äôs decrepit back line will be incredible",Arsenal,Yes,jf1c84b,t1_jf16ui8
We absolutely cannot bank on getting a draw at the Etihad. We're the massivest of underdogs in that game. We have to maximize points in every other game and that means getting a win at Anfield,Arsenal,Yes,jf19lv0,t1_jf18vji

I don‚Äôt know the answer to either question.

If it‚Äôs between the two of them then as Nketiah is already in the team, I feel like we‚Äôre more likely to sell Balogun with a first refusal option or whatever than try to bring him in and loan/sell Nketiah at the same time.",Arsenal,Yes,jf23cdu,t1_jf1ok9l

Salah might exploit Zinnys space on the wing but you honestly think he won‚Äôt move in deep to help Trent from Martinelli and Jesus(or worse Trossard).

"Havertz is fine, but you see a bunch of these kind of players a year.

At a team like Leverkusen or worse teams, good players really stick out. A player as good as Havertz will have the team built around their strengths. See Grealish at Villa, or basically any time a great player is at a non ""elite"" club.

These players almost always struggle, or have their offensive numbers crater when they join a bigger team. Grealish doesn't care because it's City and they can win with him being their 5th best player or whatever. Chelsea can't afford havertz to do the same.",Arsenal,Yes,jf1heuy,t1_jf1d2se

"Incredibly tough first job to learn how the Premier League works. He speaks Spanish and establishing trust within the squad will take time. Also so many unsettled new players and a lot of pressure from fans to succeed quickly. Sounds like a learn-on-the-go job, will be surprised if it succeeds",Arsenal,Yes,jf13bty,t1_jf11gvz
Whoever the manager be but with that bloated squad don't see a success any time soon .,Arsenal,Yes,jf11txh,t1_jf11gvz
Better pick for them than Nagelsman IMO,Arsenal,Yes,jf1314k,t1_jf11gvz
He was fantastic at Barcelona but his Spanish NT side looked toothless,Arsenal,Yes,jf1358b,t1_jf11gvz
"I don't rate him. I know he won loads with Barcelona, but he had that team at the peak times. He was deeply average with Roma which people forget, and he hasn't really impressed me with Spain either.

I wasn't keen on him when he were linked with him either. I think he would struggle in the PL and Chelsea.",Arsenal,Yes,jf18bik,t1_jf11gvz
If I supported Chelsea I would prefer having Julian,Arsenal,Yes,jf1cnp7,t1_jf11gvz
Weghorst is bang average,Arsenal,Yes,jf1k7yn,t1_jf1k3it
"idk if i agree, what we're doing is working so well even without a 9 like that. liverpool with firmino, city pre haaland (and bayern post lewa?) broke all sorts of scoring records without a traditional 9

yes there are lot more 9s available now, it seems to be coming back but i don't think it's a necessity. maybe teams are better equipped to handle a more 'false 9' type system, which might lead teams have proper 9s, but i think it depends more on the players around them

with goalscoring wingers like martinelli, saka, trossard, x, a jesus type who allows them space might be more beneficial. his type of player definitely more beneficial to our overall attacking play. sort of like how ronaldo scored more goals than weghorst, but weghorst in the team resulted in united scoring more goals (weghorst is shaped like a traditional 9 but actually drops very deep). again, just depends on personnel around the striker",Arsenal,Yes,jf1u5z2,t1_jf1k3it
I dunno. We just play so much better with a false 9 like Jesus or Trossard than we do with Eddie up front. I don't think we necessarily need a traditional 9.,Arsenal,Yes,jf2dyan,t1_jf1k3it

"Reuell Walters played with the first team during preseason and has been on the bench for some games. I think it‚Äôs the most likely one to be integrated into the first team the soonest if there‚Äôs a need for a right back (with Tomi out so often).

Did anyone expect him to be good? He's a dude that wasn't good enough for Burnley and brought in because they needed a replacement for Ronaldo. Just a stop-gap until they buy a proper striker in the summer.,Arsenal,Yes,jf16hbr,t1_jf1662f
Yeah Ten Hag is a good coach but he has a weird thing for transfers. Back at Ajax he picked up Klaiber and Labyad from his earlier stint at FC Utrecht and they were both absolute shite for them.,Arsenal,Yes,jf16e7u,t1_jf1662f
if they keep on losing the hate will start to happen,Arsenal,Yes,jf16ej2,t1_jf1662f

"Bench Trossard or Jesus. Whoever looks best in training or fits the style Arteta wants to start the game with should start.

If he wants a slower start to the game with fresh legs on the bench, start Trossard",Arsenal,Yes,jf1aaw7,t1_jf175kj
"I think it's going to be trossard bench. Jesus is back in form and clearly our best CF, saka undroppable and rested, martinelli will absolutely smoke Trent. Trossard can come in for any of those 3 in the 2nd half.",Arsenal,Yes,jf1bu3r,t1_jf175kj
"Trossard is such an impactful player, and maybe due to lack of data with the others coming in from the bench, I'd say he's got the most to offer coming off the bench",Arsenal,Yes,jf1chff,t1_jf175kj

"I wonder how long before we see Kiwior on that LB spot for the last 10 of a match. I have a hunch he is backup to both spots on the left side of defence. 

Think 2-1 up at the Etihad. It could make sense to have four centrebacks (White, Saliba, Big Gabi and Kiwior) and Tierney on at left mid. Depending on how the game is going.",Arsenal,Yes,jf13k6u,t1_jf12j0x
"IMO this will be our last big splurge, and we will sign around 5 players. 2 inexpensive backups, and one defender, midfielder, forward, like arteta usually likes to do",Arsenal,Yes,jf12pyq,t1_jf12j0x
"For me I could see Holding stay on for one more season as a emergency back up (behind two players at RCB). Considering our long season next time, the fact he is considered an important player for morale in the squad and does not seem to have qualms being on reduced play time, I could see this scenario play out (same with Elneny at DM)",Arsenal,Yes,jf190wy,t1_jf12j0x
"I think it's the next natural step for the Holding Elnenys Cedric of the squad to be sold and upgraded for players that fit the system better.

If we'd used Tierney more I don't think I'd advocate for a defensive signing at all.",Arsenal,Yes,jf1a82i,t1_jf12j0x
"I think people mean left 8, but idk",Arsenal,Yes,jf44tjy,t1_jf44nam

BRING IN JUDE,Arsenal,Yes,jf4tghn,t1_jf4pxjv
"I think this was always going to happen. The better we get, the harder it becomes to identify players who would truly improve us.

I think our entire approach towards transfers will have to change. It's no longer about getting rid of useless players or ""deadwood"" and buying players to fill gaping holes in the squad.

It's about having multiple competing players for each position. It's about replacing 8/10 players with 9/10 because that's what it comes down to against Bayern and Madrid in later rounds of CL.",Arsenal,Yes,jf581uy,t1_jf4pxjv
"There's still time to implement Boehly's revolutionary 4-4-3 because I need all of Jesus, Saka, Gabi and Trossard to start and annihilate them at Anfield",Arsenal,Yes,jf34202,t1_jf3348w
The West Ham/Newcastle game is more interesting anyway. More goals and we still have to play both these teams,Arsenal,Yes,jf3hwg2,t1_jf3ain1
"Another point of view, they have lost at least once in home this season, meaning they are not unbeatable",Arsenal,Yes,jf5bfar,t1_jf5b5r4

Kolasinac was decent, Willian made sense but didn't work out and Lichsteiner was ...yeah.",Arsenal,Yes,jf1ip8u,t1_jf1ihz5
Yaya Sanogo is a modern legend.,Arsenal,Yes,jf26ndl,t1_jf1ihz5
"Kolasinac wasn't really a flop; he played 118 times for Arsenal, even if he wasn't great. Cedric did exactly what he was signed to do - people overlook that he was backup, and just about the only senior pro in the squad for a while, and I don't know how much more long-term than seeing out his contract he could be expected to be. 

Ultimately, Arsenal haven't really been in the market for first-team free transfers in recent years, so we shouldn't have expected much from any of the squad player and backup recruits.",Arsenal,Yes,jf2fiua,t1_jf1ihz5

Imagine an Enzo - Rice - Odegaard midfield,Arsenal,Yes,jf22dwz,t1_jf1ztvw
"Given that Arteta has said he wants to win games in the final third, this would fit with his 'choosing violence' approach. Maddison's pressing is underrated.

That said, I really think Vieira was the last signing we'll make in this vein for a while yet, with both and ESR, per Arteta, capable of playing both of those advanced midfield roles.

"We really don‚Äôt. There aren‚Äôt many RBs in the world better than Ben White, and certainly none that are readily available on the market. If you mean a rotation player that‚Äôs in the Zinchenko mould, then yeah maybe.",Arsenal,Yes,jf49e8c,t1_jf45p5e
"Besides LCM, I don't see any position needing upgrading. Any other position just needs quality depth or another profile for dynamic changes(i.e instead of an overlapping rb, an inverted rb and etc)",Arsenal,Yes,jf4bnep,t1_jf45p5e
Who we gonna get that is a significant improvement over White? I just don't see any. He's been unreal for us. We'll just add depth to that position.,Arsenal,Yes,jf48ifd,t1_jf45p5e
"Obviously, depth. But in terms of starting XI, this is a really good and difficult question.

I'd rate us just about across the board the way each starting XI is playing as a solid 8/10. Saka the one exception, maybe an 8.5. It's not easy to improve on an 8. Mbappe, sure, but he's not available. Even BW. Are there RB's available that are an obvious upgrade?

If you include not just how we're playing now, but expected output over the next season, I'd say Xhaka's probably the spot you could improve on the most dramatically. He's playing well, but I'd be least surprised if his form were to drop significantly.

It's going to cost minimum 100M to land any player that immediately improves the team. And I'm not sure anyone's available that walks into our starting XI. Anyone at any position. So it's probably not worth spending to go for that outside our two aging midfielders. Probably best to go with our existing team and build depth.

Might be nice to go for another 100M+ forward. Selling Nketia and Balogun both could fund that, and then you have Trossard, ESR, and the new guy as depth for the front line.",Arsenal,Yes,jf4a4xi,t1_jf45p5e
"In terms of the starting XI, outside of midfield, I could see an improvement at CF if the right player became available. Ben White has made a terrific adjustment to RB, and I think his play and his partnership with Saka have been an underrated factor in our success. I don‚Äôt think we can meaningfully improve on Ben with the players that are expected to be available.",Arsenal,Yes,jf4cd63,t1_jf45p5e
like a tomi replacement? white is too good this season only rival for toty is trippier,Arsenal,Yes,jf49a5t,t1_jf45p5e
Who is the top signing at RB? I am genuinely asking. I don‚Äôt really see any options that are an improvement on White.,Arsenal,Yes,jf4d43f,t1_jf45p5e

"I'm torn tbh. 

They are a different team at Anfield. But then again, they got bodied by Leeds at Anfield. They were awful vs Chelsea at home, awful vs Wolves and Leicester lost because that CB they have is legit a joke. Their only convincing game was the United game. 

I have no idea how it will go. On paper, our left and right side shits all over them, and Partey, Xhaka, Zinchenko and Odegaard shits on their midfield. But I remain unconfident",Arsenal,Yes,jf273wu,t1_jf23u2k

"It's not a myth in the sense of being fiction -- our bid on Vlahovic was confirmed -- but that player has to be a lot more than 'a tall 9', the same way that Arteta has pushed Eddie to become more than a poacher.

Balogun is hard to get a read on considering the league he‚Äôs putting these numbers in. I suspect people are getting a little ahead of themselves. 

If Nelson was going to be kept I feel like we would have heard some noise by now. I feel bad for the lad but he might just be unfortunate in that the teams trajectory is beyond his ceiling and therefore Edu would rather part ways and bring in a higher ceiling to replace him - or we already have it in Marquinhos. 

I suspect they are open to signing a striker who would actually compete with Jesus - at the moment nketiah doesn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs despite me rating him quite a bit more than the general opinion - a lot of it is style tbf.",Arsenal,Yes,jf1bj7w,t1_jf190hl

"People were actually okay with Isak. I remember the sub high on him during that one January window and I think that one time he was balling in the Euros. The problem was his release clause so another group didn't think he was worth it. 

Other people wanted him because we badly needed a striker in. Anyone at that point. There were calls for names like Jonathan David. 

About Newcastle's football, every time I watch them, they are running over teams. They took the game to Chelsea, Spurs and United. Hell they managed to get 3 into City's net. The reason they sat back vs us was because we were too good( as their one player said) and kept playing through their onslaught. 

Their problem is finishing, not haram ball. They had a stupid goalless draw vs Leeds where the ball deliberately refused to go in. 

Also, Maddison might not make them scary. If they actually add another fighter in Scott, then some pacy winger like Diaby, that's not good news. Any defensively solid team with a transition of Diaby is bad news.",Arsenal,Yes,jf44x80,t1_jf3x20m

"enrique would be better for chelsea. he's a better man manager/personal coach and that team definitely needs one. spain were boring because of the lack of outlets and 1v1 wingers out wide which chelsea currently have.

would be better for us if chelsea get nagelsmann",Arsenal,Yes,jf2sa2z,t1_jf2micd
"It's not like Enrique hasn't coached any other team other than Spain.  He's a positional play coach, which may mean he slots in with what Potter was attempting to do.  While Spain was hardly inspirational or exciting, I think it at least shows he can coach his basic concepts at a simplified level to a group.  

Nagelsmann, in my mind, is synonymous with playing without a striker, which may suit the current player pool.  I'm not sure if there are the right type of defenders there to really make what he wants to do work.

Both are pretty contentious people though and I don't feel too much heartburn about either.  If I'm being honest (and possibly stupid) I'm more concerned about the likes of Ange Postecoglou, who has shown he can come into a club in a bit of turmoil and refocus things.",Arsenal,Yes,jf2tpsu,t1_jf2micd
"Nagelsmann is too similar to Potter IMO.  Young, doesn't have the clout, will end up pissing off a spoilt Chelsea squad and probably falling out with the dumb executives or anyone with an big ego.  A lot of the things I read around why he was sacked at Bayern are the same things for Potter at Chelsea.  Chelsea have also recently built a nasty habit of throwing their manager under the bus when it gets hard, I don't see Nagelsmann being able to fight that off when they hit that wall.  I haven't forgotten Tuchel went the same way, they wanted him gone, and if it can happen to him it can happen to Nagelsmann.

Enrique has the clout and if he can endure Barca's execs he'll be fine.  He's proven he at least wants his teams to play the same way as your Potters, Nagelsmanns, but remains to be seen if he can do it at this level and building from a team that has a rotten culture with far too many senior players.",Arsenal,Yes,jf2vj47,t1_jf2micd
"We've dealt with pacey players all season. Arteta seems to have learned since the defeat at Old Trafford, we haven't been hit on the counter like that since.

"I‚Äôm not really discrediting him, I think he‚Äôs a great manager who only works well in certain parameters - which is absolutely fine. 

He just doesn‚Äôt seem to have the personality or ability to take that next step up, and a large part of it is the lack of being a people‚Äôs person really. 

It‚Äôs hard to be at a top club unless you have that charisma & charm in abundance, we‚Äôve seen many coaches who people rave about but just have lacked that in one way or the other (Steve McClaren is meant to be a top, top coach - but we all saw what happened with England for eg).

It isn't that weird: 

1) they play 3 difficult games in 8 days, players will need rest.

2) Some players put in a shambolic performance against Man City, they needed to be dropped.

3) Some players were actually ill. Rumours of little knocks/niggles too plus Salah was fasting and the game was late (that could have had an impact in the decision making).

This is literally laugh out loud funny. I can guarantee you that one thing Klopp didn't consider even for a moment when picking his team was the effect on Arsenal's 'title challenge'. The thought won't even have entered his head.,Arsenal,Yes,jf2bd2n,t1_jf26vlf
"I mean to me it just looks like he was trying to make a move which could allow them to get a result against both teams.

Chelsea are shit - Klopp probably thought that the team he put out should be enough to sneak a win. Then he has his best players available to try and secure the win over us as well.

Makes sense to me. I think the angle that people are forgetting is that Chelsea are very bad. He wasn't intentionally throwing, he just probably thought it'd be enough to pick up the win.",Arsenal,Yes,jf27q8z,t1_jf26vlf
"You're quite the victim if you genuinely believe this. Klopp tried something new against a supposedly also shite team. Salah was also with thigh problems before the game. I doubt klopp cares in the slightest about the title race. You literally just proved the OP correct.

Give your head a wobble.",Arsenal,Yes,jf29h10,t1_jf26vlf
"Is Trossard deadwood? I'm not saying sign finished players, I'm saying signing another 21 to 23 yr old CB will be bad for their development. We can't afford to give gametime for players like that when we're in a win now situation.",Arsenal,Yes,jf1bbfl,t1_jf10hqp

Arsenal fans at the moment get nervous about anything. Its the byproduct of being quite bad for a long time. Essentially a form of imposter syndrome I guess.,Arsenal,Yes,jf2bynj,t1_jf2bm9x

"never seen a fanbase so sure of something so uncertain 

people act like we‚Äôre playing a relegation tier team that is weak at home",Arsenal,Yes,jf2dtol,t1_jf2bm9x
City also does not really depend on Grealish to score. His main schtick has been carrying the ball and being a wide playmaker for them which is a very niche role. Havertz has a lot of a mismatched load on him with his very niche qualities somewhat resembling those of a striker while not being good at the basics of what a striker should be good at. Weird niche player who some manager could maybe make something more complete of if he is lucky.,Arsenal,Yes,jf1j8jk,t1_jf1heuy

"Yeah i listened to that one too. Its decently informative if you haven't followed the youth sides at all.

I gave the podcast a sub because of that episode, it was quality all the way around i thought.",Arsenal,Yes,jf2pzvo,t1_jf29q6r
"Cheers mate, what about America? I'll watch the WHU game but wanna see Utd get bullied by Brentford again",Arsenal,Yes,jf2kdgz,t1_jf2ibqv
I think you‚Äôre right but at the same time I think trossard has to start given he scored a hat trick at anfield,Arsenal,Yes,jf1822v,t1_jf17ecb

"Why would it be an ""absolutely not""? Hes killing it in ligue 1",Arsenal,Yes,jf4adv3,t1_jf446ko
"I agree but I get why he said it. Anfield is by far the easiest of these three games right now, if we don't win it then confidence for the other two goes down quite a bit and we obviously can't afford to lose/draw all 3.",Arsenal,Yes,jf11y85,t1_jf11str
"But if we don‚Äôt win against this Liverpool side at Anfield, how do we expect points against City or Newcastle away?

Unless you‚Äôre also expecting City to drop loads of points, that many losses doesn‚Äôt win the league.",Arsenal,Yes,jf12ggx,t1_jf11str
Based on what would you put in Kiwior at the Etihad??,Arsenal,Yes,jf14b9o,t1_jf13k6u
"He‚Äôs overvalued. A great player, but we can get two starters for the price of Bellingham. Overpaying for single stars is very much not the model that brought us success",Arsenal,Yes,jf4zmaj,t1_jf4tghn
"And the more expensive those players are. 

The good thing is, regardless of whether they win the league or not, this is a pretty damn complete team. I trust everybody in the starting lineup. So as you say, it's not about filling any gaping holes as much as adding depth and fine-tuning this really young, really talented core. 

Won't be easy to keep hitting in the transfer market, but add 3-5 more Trossards -- not necessarily in terms of $$$ but impact -- over the next year or two and we should have our best window to contend since the Henry super teams.",Arsenal,Yes,jf5care,t1_jf581uy
"Losing just once at home is a sign of strength.

They're in a club with us, City, Man U, Newcastle and...Brentford.

So far we've failed to win away at Man U, we did beat Brentford but if we continue that 50% success rate against teams of this level we will almost certainly lose the league unless City seriously fuck up elsewhere.",Arsenal,Yes,jf5bvi8,t1_jf5bfar

I'm wondering if Ndidi would be worth looking at... haven't heard his name much the past two seasons but he was nasty for them at one point,Arsenal,Yes,jf2gcd5,t1_jf1k27d
Agree its the space left by gabriel and then covered by holding that could be exploited by someone like nunez who is fast and could get in the box quick goalside of holding. They scored at the emirates this way because gabriel didnt clear an aerial ball on his side and saliba was split from him and that space in between got exploited with no midfielders tracking.,Arsenal,Yes,jf35rs5,t1_jf2vemk
"i was just under the impression that White still prefers to play CB, but doing a google i can‚Äôt find any quotes to that end tbh",Arsenal,Yes,jf101yw,t1_jf0zu03
"Arteta sees fixes where we don't even see problems. 

We had White at CB and he brought in Saliba into the XI. Nobody wanted an upgrade on white, we got one.

We had Tierney at LB and he brought in Zinchenko. Nobody wanted an upgrade on Tierney, we got one.

We had Leno, we paid ¬£30m for Ramsdale, nobody thought that was a priority, it completely changed our team.

Arteta continues to suprise us. And I think a huge surprise this summer will be prioritising a RB. We'll all shout about how we need a CM, CDM and backup RW first but that won't matter and then next year we'll all wonder how we upgraded a position that didn't need upgrading.",Arsenal,Yes,jf10zro,t1_jf0zu03
No way we are selling Tomi. His versatility is too valuable in our back 4. And Arteta loves his versatile players.,Arsenal,Yes,jf106no,t1_jf0zxpo
They've both barely been injured this season,Arsenal,Yes,jf142gq,t1_jf0zxpo
"Fun fact, Rangnick had three less points in his season at this stage than United do currently under the 'transformational', 'world class' Ten Hag",Arsenal,Yes,jf181el,t1_jf17gyt

"Getting in a midfielder shouldn't stop you bringing players in other positions though? All our attackers have a similar physical profile, so having another option would be beneficial.

"yes but i look at the table and seemed beeing first comfortable and very far from Pool, after 3/4 of the season. I d fear more a current inform Newcastle that is very structured.

"It baffles me that people didn‚Äôt know trossard was good before we signed him. He was easily Brighton‚Äôs top player for the last two seasons, and one of the best players outside the big six teams imo.",Arsenal,Yes,jf462ce,t1_jf42xcu

"I agree with Trossard even though I haven't really seen too much of Mudryk. Mudryk was always going to be a gamble, albeit one that might have been world class. 

But Trossard is reliable, has played in the PL before and is incredibly versatile in the front 3, we can play him anywhere. Perfect signing imo, I couldn't be happier.",Arsenal,Yes,jf63ykl,t1_jf42xcu

"Considering the form Flo is in, it's not wild to think we'd receive a 45-55m bid. Eddie has proven he can compete in the league, still very young with a lot of potential and of course has the infamous English tax. It's not insane to think we could get 100-120m for both. Ferguson would cost us a pretty penny though, considering how much Brighton wanted for Caicedo.",Arsenal,Yes,jf1qiby,t1_jf1m6eh

"Vlahovic isn‚Äôt more though. 

Arteta clearly wants every outfield player to be comfortable with the ball in midfield areas. They might specialise in certain aspects of the game but they can all either advance or drop into midfield throughout the game.

Should a people who were historically oppressed, systemetically exterminated, expelled and marginalised now turn around and do the same thing to others using that treatment as justification?

We should be handpicking the absolute cream of the crop to bolster the squad. He's a special talent and every indication shows he's only going to get better. I do get your point about overpaying on single positions but the club has been careful with its finances and with CL football a certainty maybe it is time to push the boat out on such a talent. Anyway, even if we were in for him there is a good chance we'd get gazumped by Real Madrid, City or even Liverpool (although that's looking much less likely) but if we did get him even for what I'm sure will be an exorbitant fee I'd be celebrating.",Arsenal,Yes,jf5gdy3,t1_jf4zmaj

"1) Nobody in our attack in the first half played well. Leeds marked Xhaka and Odegaard out of the game meaning there was little progression to our forwards. Trossard didn't play great for the same reason nobody did, it was tactical.

2) Leeds played with a back 5/6 at times, Trossard played in his less favoured RW position, unfamiliar with √òdegaard and White's movements, that will improve with experience.

3) When Arteta adjusted in the 2nd half, everyone played better and we scored 3. Trossard was key in our 3rd with a fantastic assist.

I don't think it has much to do with change of ownership. They had good recruitment which led to success which in turn brought European football. Recruitment went downhill but nobody realized the magnitude of the situation before they missed out on Europe. They were left with a bloated squad and wage bill for a team only playing league games.

"Okay. How about the points City dropped to Palace and Southampton during the title race last season? You say West Ham were still a very good team last season, Liverpool are still a very good team at Anfield this season. Let‚Äôs not forget that they beat City there as well.

The narrative you‚Äôre trying to push, that both of those teams were absolutely perfect and flawless in the final run-ins, was only true in 18/19 at the absolute peak of their rivalry, and this is what a lot of people will want to use to justify a meltdown on here if we don‚Äôt win at Anfield. I understand the nerves are crazy right now because we haven‚Äôt been in this position for a long time, but you guys need to chill.

It‚Äòs not just because of this one game though. We were in a similar situation last season when Ben White got injured and Holding had to cover for the remainder of the season.

"They couldn't spend last season because they were fucked by missing out on Europe. They were only able to spend a lot before because they sold their good players for hefty prices and had Europe. FFP was a hot topic amongst LCFC fans and journalists this summer.

They've also brought in enough players until this season. The only problem is they brought in deadweight on big wages such as Vestergard and that other 0 - 9 defender. Those players are refusing moves and are too shit to play especially in a relegstion scrap.

They were stuck between a rock and a hard place before the season started. Either they sell key players and try for a rebuild while battling relegation or they sell enough to dodge FFP and challenge for Europe.

You said West Ham were still a very good team.

This was all in response to OP saying we don‚Äôt deserve to win the league if we don‚Äôt win at Anfield because Liverpool are 29 points behind. City and Liverpool have dropped points to notably worse teams during the title race. It happens. And City themselves have dropped points to Liverpool at Anfield this season.

Everyone knows its been 15 years since they won a trophy, but they're currently looking at Europa League next season, have debts of ¬£600m which will likely restrict summer spending, and their squad profile is atrocious. Their latest marquee attacker signing has yet to score a league goal and is tied down until 2027, Son's form has fallen off a cliff and he has seemingly lost his burst of speed he used to have, and Kane is hardly looking a certainty to stay. Their defenders have been signed for the purpose of a 3/5 at the back system (Romero, Perisic, Porro, etc), whilst Lloris so clearly needs to be replaced. On top of that, there are horrendous culture issues in terms of attitude and commitment. Additionally, the likes of Mourinho and Conte (both who have achieved some huge successes in recent years) have been there, left, and said there are fundamental problems that exist.

What manager is realistically going to want to turn up and work with they're given in terms of a 3/5 at the back squad profile, culture issues, shoestring budget and all the issues in terms of Son no longer performing, Kane not committing to staying and Richarlison being a shadow of his former self?

This year arteta has blown them away, and put the balance back as it should be. But if you don't want to see a repeat of the 2016/17-2021/22 Spurs vs Arsenal league positions in your lifetime then them missing CL should trump all other rivals failures. 

Remember how you felt before the Spurs - Liverpool CL final. 

If they don't get this right and miss multiple years in a row, it will hurt them a lot. More than us even winning the league will.

"It's not that much better in terms of the actual players we are identifying. 

The last regime got us saliba and martinelli, aubameyang and Tierney let's not forget. And we've had our share of flops since then. 

It's the joined up thinking (wanky term sorry), whereby the football side identifies the spaces, the technical directors identify players who will fit but if they fail they have an upside. 

They've done a lot of work to focus on character as well rather than just technical ability. Which is smart becuase that's failed us massively in the past. 

Loans department has done a lot of good, where I think players like tavares, lokonga, Mari, pepe, would have been much bigger problems had they been in our squad still. 

All joined up, working to one goal.",Arsenal,Yes,jerzrui,t1_jerwze8
"There is a development pattern forming.

Several times now, we've made an attempt to sign a certain profile of player on the cheap, and then signed another (or two other) much more expensive version.

The most obvious example of this is probably Tavares and Zinchenko, but I'd argue that we're about to see it again with Sambi and Rice/Caicedo, and that we've already seen it play out with Mari and Gabriel (and Kiwior).

To put it another way, if we'd paid ¬£37m for Zinchenko, we'd still be very happen with him right now; that amount got us, in essence, a punt on Tavares that didn't work out, and Zinchenko the following summer.

Sambi cost about 3x Tavares' fee, but it's still a fraction of what we're about to invest in our midfield. Had Sambi worked out, and developed, as hoped, to the level of, say, Caicedo, we'd have made out like bandits.

I think this is something we'll continue to see, and I'm fine with it, because I have so much belief in Arteta's coaching and the club culture under him.

The other peculiar angle is here is the deals we *didn't* make: not ones where we missed, but where we decided not to proceed.

Probably the most notable example of this was the move we made for Arthur last January, in comparison with the offers we made on Zubimendi, Caicedo, and eventually the Jorginho stopgap signing this year. Per Ornstein, Edu and Arteta had were completely behind getting Arthur on loan with a 40m option for 18 months-- notably the same 18 month term that we signed Jorginho to. Despite Edu and Arteta both wanting it, the 'club hierarchy' (Ornstein's words, clearing referring to KSE) shut down the Arthur move. This is one of the few examples we can identify of the club *not* backing Arteta, but the implicit reasoning behind it in light of Jorginho is interesting.",Arsenal,Yes,jes2d1q,t1_jerwze8
"Edu did oversee a pretty fundamental change in our recruitment team, but I think aside from that, a lot comes down to the understanding between Edu and Arteta of the type of person they both want at the club.  

Aside from that though, I think the culture and environment at the club has radically changed.  The level at the club right now is *fucking high*.  Saka, Jesus, Martinelli, Odegaard, Xhaka, Gabriel, Saliba, White, Partey and Zina are an obscene group of (1) talent and (2) professionals.  The manager has much higher expectations too.  Despite that, the environment doesn't seem cold and harsh, it's welcoming.  Players talk about the team as ""family"" and there is an obvious cohesion in the group.

"It's not necessarily the right way to look at City's development. I follow City a lot because Haaland is really fun to watch, and they are worse now but it's not because they have the best striker in the world (duh), it's because they don't have proper inverted fullbacks for Pep's new system

With Haaland up top (instead of a false 9 that drops deep) they became vulnerable to counters and pressing. Rodri is great but he still needs Bernado Silva or Gundogan to pair up with to control the midfield as part of the rest defence, similar to how we are at our best when it's Zinchenko beside Partey. But when one of them drops deeper, suddenly you don't have someone to link up with Haaland, leaving him isolated and ineffectual which happened earlier in the season

Now how does a proper inverted FB figure into this? Ironically, Zinchenko would be perfect for them right now, as he would just tuck into midfield, so that Gundogan etc can stay up top as false 8s. But earlier in the season, neither Sergio nor Cancelo could play this controlling role beside Rodri. 

Why doesn't Cancelo work here? It's because he doesn't naturally invert deeper where he is needed in this system, he inverts further up field in the attacking inside half space. You will know what I mean if you watch his touch maps last season, he was often occupying very advanced areas, ahead of Silva. This worked when they played false 9s up top to drop deeper to create space and link up, not when you have a true 9 like Haaland. Cancelo is also a problem for other reasons, like his tendency to occupy the same spaces as Grealish who likes to cut inside.

Pep found a makeshift solution, by playing Rico Lewis who inverts from RB into DM beside Rodri to restore balance such that their 8s can stay further up. And it's worked, there was an immediate uptick in form when he entered the first 11. Now, it's John Stones doing that. He played inverted RB recently. But clearly, these are solutions that are makeshift. He's even tried Bernado Silva at LB. That's reminiscent of us playing Xhaka at LB, and it happens because you want an LB who can invert, and sometimes when you have none you plug a midfielder there. Pep is sorely lacking a good inverted LB. But when he has that, expect them to do even better lol 

So people are kind of missing the actual reasons why City don't look as good as last season and end up with wrong conclusions. They see the addition of Haaland, but not the massive departures like Zinchenko. Will City's midfielders score more eventually? Yes, when they get better fullbacks. Right now their 8s are sitting deeper because they suffered massive losses in the FB department, and that's why they score less. It will change after a transfer window or two

tl;dr does Haaland really improve city isn't necessarily even the right question to ask, it's really, what are the changes in aggregate, and what are the biggest ones that cause them to look worse: it's their fullbacks or rather, the lack of.

Also a big part of him being there is them saying he better not go anywhere else. But if you have the goal scoring records that he has I can‚Äôt imagine him not getting it.

We watched City do this for years and laughed at their results. I'm in no hurry to declare their project a failure just yet. All it takes is a favorable fixture list and a good run of form for a lot of those players to build confidence and challenge.

80 points is the threshold for mathematical qualification. It goes down as spurs and Brighton drop points.,Arsenal,Yes,jerj0fo,t1_jerin2y
"Just on a points basis, we can no longer finish below 8th with all the games left to play. However that doesn‚Äôt take into account those 7 teams playing each other for the rest of the year and therefore not being able to all pick up max points",Arsenal,Yes,jerkpmk,t1_jerin2y

"I don‚Äôt think we have a leader like that, they seem to really like each other and have a proper partnership. 

Saliba is definitely the calmer one and that maybe indicates a leadership level? But that‚Äôs largely due to role in team, Saliba taking on more of a sweeping role like van dijk in the managing of a high line.",Arsenal,Yes,jeuktxa,t1_jeuf10o

"There are plenty of good managers out there. I'm not as worried about Poch, he doesn't seem to handle big personalities well and Chelsea have a lot of personalities to manage. He was ran out of spurs for a reason, and that reason was being 14th in the table in November after being in the champions league final. 

He's more of a known quantity, and i'm not as concerned that he would somehow elevate Chelsea who have proven themselves to not have patience with mid-table results. 

Pochettino at spurs benefited from good timing for other top sides. United and Arsenal were in post-saf and late-wenger era turmoil. liverpool were in a period of figuring themselves out with rodgers and then took a couple years for Klopp to get that team clicking. City also had their two worst seasons since 2010/11 during poch's first two seasons (last pellegrini and first pep year). This also coincided with Chelsea winning the league with jose, sacking him the next season, hiring conte and winning the league with him the year after. 

I don't doubt he can motivate players, but i doubt chelsea's structure as well as the general landscape of the premier league today and moving forward. City aren't going anywhere as long as they have Pep, and we should continue to compete in the top 4 (at a minimum) as long as we have the squad we do and continue to invest. 

Below us, liverpool aren't finished as long as Klopp is there. With good investment this summer they should bounce back and klopp is a better manager than poch. United with ETH are perfectly fine, and they can spend with chelsea and are a more attractive destination at the moment. Newcastle can outspend almost anyone and it seems inevitable they'll be in the top 4 race for years to come with their backing. And hell, Aston Villa have been the third best side in the league once Emery came in and they could break into the europa spots if they continue their form. 

Whether Brighton, Fulham, or Brentford are able to keep up their form in future seasons as their players get poached is another factor, as well as Spurs in a similar position to chelsea of struggling with identity and being impatient as clubs they consider to be peers out-perform them. The general landscape of the top half of the PL today is far more competitive than it was during Poch's seasons at Spurs. And his fall from grace coincided with Pep and Klopp taking over the league. 

And lastly, i heard the same things about Spurs guaranteed to achieve success with Jose and that led to nothing. And then the same with folks worried that Conte would achieve success at Spurs, which led to nothing for them but more embarrassment. Just like how the spurs directors have absolutely failed to demonstrate a cohesive and savy strategy, Chelsea under Boehly have done the same. Seemingly no strategy in the transfer market, over-pay for a lot of players and expect a manager to make it work while also needing to off-load players not in those plans.",Arsenal,Yes,jesgujb,t1_jes4qks

"The way Liverpool play this season, Salah is most dangerous on the break i.e. when the fullbacks are out of position. The battle won't be Salah vs the LB it will be Salah vs big Gabi.

The best way to defend their counter is to limit turnovers in awkward positions and aggressively press when they do happen. 

The only reason to maybe play Tierney would be to overload down their right and bully Trent",Arsenal,Yes,jerkc04,t1_jeripjy
"Liverpool will have a Fabinho, Henderson, Elliott in midfield. It‚Äôs a poor midfield. We can strangle them in the middle with Zinchenko inverting. The best way to beat Liverpool is to own the ball and make them do a lot of defending.",Arsenal,Yes,jerj6l6,t1_jeripjy

But playing Tierney over Zinchenko means we are going there not to have ball all the time and control the tempo which goes against everything Arteta has built",Arsenal,Yes,jerjrvi,t1_jeripjy

"Mate, this Holding out bandwagon needs to die but way more importantly why on earth do you think the guy who has never stopped Salah and Liverpool before suddenly will now?

Love Tierney but he's been roasted by Salah whenever we've played and City have literally just shown Liverpool are most vulnerable if you take control of midfield which is the whole point of Zinchenko.",Arsenal,Yes,jerl48n,t1_jeripjy
"We need someone who can stop him from breaking away. Blanco has nunez covered on the left but I'm worried about salah on the right.

I don't think arteta will start tierney anyways and he's barely played in the last few months. Not confident holding can handle gakpo in the box either, very desperate for saliba to come back for this one",Arsenal,Yes,jeriykc,t1_jeripjy

He's probably Barcelona bound,Arsenal,Yes,jesutas,t1_jesqc2g
Play the long game. Was Toney as good as Eddie is now when he was 23? Look at Eddie‚Äôs improvements just in the past year alone and believe. Strikers mature in their late 20s on average.,Arsenal,No,jesq4ur,t1_jespbt3
"I would take it. 

It's unpopular here but a tall competent striker is stuff of my dreams. 

The other problem is that Eddie elevates clubs like Brighton to a level where they can actually be more scary.",Arsenal,No,jetyjyo,t1_jespbt3
Yes without question. I love Eddie but Toney is basically a Kane regen. Put him in this side and he becomes the most prolific striker in the league bar Haaland imo.,Arsenal,No,jesr0o9,t1_jespbt3
"I wouldn‚Äôt tbh Jesus joined us in his prime and probably expected to be a starter, he won‚Äôt be happy being 2nd choice striker after just one season and he‚Äôll probably look to leave",Arsenal,No,jesruvp,t1_jespbt3
"Yes. Our wing situation will be a bit tricky because we may have to push Jesus out to LW and that's detrimental to Martinelli, but toney for us would score like 25 goals",Arsenal,No,jesq4o0,t1_jespbt3

"Gabriel CAN make recovery runs he's been doing it all season. He's covering a huge amount of space when Zinny inverts and moves upfield. 

Holding cannot against faster attackers when playing in a high line. He's absolutely fine when against slower players or if we're sitting deep. Let's not pretend he's useless. Sadly, Ben White will need to give him a lot of Saliba doesn't come back vs Liverpool.",Arsenal,Yes,jes5em0,t1_jes3p2c

"> ...you just get to see why a Holding-Gabriel partnership is untenable versus top teams. Both can't make recovery runs

Gabriel can't make recovery runs?

lol

White and Thomas certainly did have to do a good deal of work to support Holding, but that's a surprise to no-one. Even Holding's biggest fans acknowledge he's nowhere near Saliba's level.",Arsenal,Yes,jesfvm5,t1_jes3p2c
you will have access to tickets but wont get them due to the crazy demand.,Arsenal,Yes,jesuj1b,t1_jessblg
I just hope goddison is the first away game of the season on a nice sunny afternoon,Arsenal,Yes,jeu1pgd,t1_jetzzzz
Tuchel is a criminally underrated manager. He literally fixed the team in less than a season and managed to get 3rd last season. He even did decent at the beginning of the season.,Arsenal,Yes,jerhzw7,t1_jerhoyh
"Tuchel is and will always be a ticking time bomb. Sublime tactician that he is, he's a horrible man manager and is virtually guaranteed to lose the dressing room within 2 seasons...like Mou.

He'd already lost the dressing room at Chelsea so it was right to move him on. Their only problem is they've got no quality in upper management to build longer term.

They're going to go and hire another boutique checkbook manager but they'd be better served looking for their own version of De Zerbi.",Arsenal,Yes,jerkr2w,t1_jerhoyh
"Fair enough with Rangnick, although I still stand by that while United were a hot mess, he also wasn't immune to criticism. Like, if they were only a 5/10, he still had them performing at a 3 or 4. He always looked lost on the bench.

Mourinho is a bit different. They were clearly a mismatch, but Mourinho chose to respond by throwing his toys out of the pram and playing awful football. He gets away with taking a lot of the blame because the timing of being fired right before a cup final is hilarious, as well as being able to point at his success with Chelsea and United while leaving out how badly those stints ended as well.",Arsenal,Yes,jerjhka,t1_jeriqtj
It‚Äôs also because Mikel is the real deal and a genuine elite manager unlike Potter and the other pretenders,Arsenal,Yes,jerhsp4,t1_jerhmgt
"My point is that fans of those teams continously act like Arteta *only* did well because he was given time, as if anyone could do it with the same resources provided.

Potter clearly wasn't going to turn it around, even if you gave him another two years. Conte finally got ""his players"" and was still gone before the season even ended.",Arsenal,Yes,jerhz4g,t1_jerhmgt
"What he mean is, not all manager succeed after given a lot of time. Even if manager A and B was given the same time, the result could have been different. 

Mikel was given time, but because mikel is also good we are succeeding.",Arsenal,Yes,jeri5gj,t1_jerhmgt
"> Yes, over a few windows, we spent quite a lot

Other fans are also talking about our net spend as though we didn't spend the final 5 years under Wenger recruiting players we would eventually have to pay to leave. If you look at the actual players in our current team in isolation it's a fairly cheap squad compared to other title contending teams. Our top 3 goalscorers have 35 goals between them and cost a combined ¬£40m.",Arsenal,Yes,jerlw1h,t1_jerkzrg
"No one gets it right all the time.

Even prime Wenger had Cygan and Stepanovs",Arsenal,Yes,jerm0nd,t1_jerkzrg
"I classify those signings as under the Raul regime - every signing since Raul left has been either really good (Partey, White, Tomi, Jesus, Zinchenko etc) or a relatively cheap risk (Tavares, Sambi)",Arsenal,Yes,jerlze9,t1_jerkzrg
I was watching Sancho yesterday and he really looks like a pale shadow of his former self. He just doesn't look exciting and a winger NEEDS to be electric and exciting.,Arsenal,Yes,jerlnjz,t1_jerkqdp
"Their first goal was fine, moment of Rashford brilliance. Second goal absolutely criminal. Spilling the ball from the corner to that dwarf of a CB who heads it in. They‚Äôve only scored three times from set pieces all season as well.",Arsenal,Yes,jerrrje,t1_jerrn4h
"Imagine Nagelsmann taking orders from the likes of Levy man üò≠

"Gabriel will definitely be drawn to defend the wide areas against salah and its not allowing the cross to come in for the likes of nunez and jota. Gabriel needs to have a really good game. Against liverpool at home, gabriel/saliba made a few errors that allowed liverpool to get back into the game.",Arsenal,Yes,jerkxk2,t1_jerjm29
"I don't know why he says 'the greatest collapse ever' as well. Liverpool 'bottled' it from this exact point in 18/19. They're the only team to have run out this far in pl history after this many games and not won.

If we lose at City and draw at anfield and win everything else, whilst City win everything, City win the title. I hardly call that a 'collapse'.",Arsenal,Yes,jerth9d,t1_jert5yx
Yeah Liverpool fans talking about lack of injuries when their core players have managed to remain injury free for 2-3 seasons with such an intense style of play....and the season they faced with injury crisis they barely got top4,Arsenal,Yes,jerug24,t1_jerst2y
"All with his so-called ""weak foot"", too.",Arsenal,Yes,jes1gi7,t1_jertmma
I think if he‚Äôs coming on it‚Äôs got to be for Jesus. I‚Äôve not been convinced by him on either wing in our system but as false 9 he‚Äôs been outstanding,Arsenal,Yes,jeruqlg,t1_jertatg
"Martinelli is definitely the best suited against Trent, some of his best games were against Liverpool, but I think since that's so much the case we might see Milner at RB or something",Arsenal,No,jertjdv,t1_jert37o
He got caught trying to evade an account ban and caught an IP ban,Arsenal,Yes,jevkq0u,t1_jevkgwm
"People speculated a lot that he had created multiple accounts to troll on this sub, but the smoking gun evidence was him commenting on or r/coys with his rob account, and then accidentally replying to the same comment chain with his alt account he used on this sub. If I remember correctly, he referred back to the rob comment in his alt comment, but using the words 'my point was', so it was very clear he had forgotten to switch back to his rob account, and so he finally got banned for trolling.

The absolutely irony is the amount of times he's called other supporters pathetic for spending time on r/coys replying to his brainless comments, when the man himself did the exact same and worse. Literally the definition of no integrity.",Arsenal,Yes,jew7e8g,t1_jevkgwm
So glad we don‚Äôt have to deal with Mane right now,Arsenal,Yes,jerwh5k,t1_jerjkd4

Zina is going to show him levels he didn't even know were there.,Arsenal,Yes,jeszbpp,t1_jeswc1r
"I know he‚Äôs one of their best players, but that‚Äôs just completely embarrassing to lose like that at home. Milan may have a psychological advantage going into the CL games now",Arsenal,Yes,jerh89s,t1_jergwne
"That's being obtuse and unfair on Milan.

Saelemakers, Leao, Diaz and Tonali were all brilliant.",Arsenal,Yes,jergzw9,t1_jergpmc
Damn. He must have had the game of his life to destroy them in their own yard. Wonder how this will affect both teams mentally for the CL matches,Arsenal,Yes,jergwrj,t1_jergpmc
"Is Osimhen much more important to Napoli than Saka is to Arsenal? Napoli have a team full of very good players, it's surprising that one players absence caused them to suffer this shock defeat. This current Arsenal team would not lose 4-0 at home if Saka was absent.",Arsenal,Yes,jerqc15,t1_jerp83s
I‚Äôm on my knees with my maw agape,Arsenal,Yes,jeu32xb,t1_jeu2bwe
"I disagree. Occasionally Pep will tweak a players role, but that's about it. His JDP fundamentals remain, ALWAYS, and there's  a little fluidity - and sometimes a role change - within that. Every manger ""tinkers"" a little.

Potter and Nagelsmann completely change systems game to game. One they're setting up for transition actions, then next they're diverting attacks wide with wingbacks, the next they're compacting the centre with inverted full backs. You can't ask players to be able to execute different tactics to an elite level every 3-7 days.",Arsenal,Yes,jerryyg,t1_jerpggf
Pep?,Arsenal,Yes,jerph19,t1_jergs9q
This is very underrated in being some of the worst punditry ever this season. He should‚Äôve been ashamed with this kind of analysis.,Arsenal,Yes,jeu853c,t1_jeu6w72
"Agreed, but prior to the City game I saw some people thinking that Liverpool would prefer to see us win because of their rivalry with City, which didn‚Äôt make much sense.",Arsenal,Yes,jerwlkf,t1_jerwbuc
"Sure, but it was annoying to watch how ponderous they were against City knowing full well that they‚Äôll turn into the globetrotters against us at Anfield this weekend.",Arsenal,Yes,jes2wdr,t1_jes2pus

You‚Äôre right! I did say almost lol,Arsenal,Yes,jeuqw7b,t1_jeuoel1
He owes us anyway for the discounted deal he got on Fabregas.,Arsenal,Yes,jeup1v9,t1_jeujeyt
"It's mile better than the last regime.

Raul brought in 13 players, 4 worked - Tierney, Saliba, Martinelli, Leno.  Then there's Guendo who kinda did.

However Martinelli and Saliba both needed cooking time so can we count them compared to players who may still end up cemented in the first team like Vieira and Marqunhos?

Its also worth noting that only 2 signings from that era are actually good enough to play in our best XI so really they made 2 good signings and neither were instant impact players which is what we needed at the time.",Arsenal,Yes,jes188s,t1_jerzrui

"illegal in france and mandatory in spain i believe, but not illegal here. definitely uncommon though which makes it a shit tier rumour all the same.",Arsenal,Yes,jesxfje,t1_jeswz64
Basically he watches for his job but not for fun. I can imagine him complaining because he'd already watched everything he needed to for analysis and then they asked him to watch more football and was like WHY??,Arsenal,Yes,jerpjoc,t1_jero4kc
"I think the same. He probably would like to play for England but he's not particularly devastated if not. More than that, he wouldn't show that he was upset even if he was. He's just too cool for that.",Arsenal,Yes,jerr8hd,t1_jerqxmq
"I'm sure Ben would watch video analysis as instructed. He's not going to get away with any nonsense with Arteta or previous managers like Bielsa. The video analysis is often edited sections of games which highlight key points that players need to be aware of rather than full games.

To me, Ben seems like a very motivated professional who wants to do the best job he can. He's interested in what's important for his job and his team.  He just doesn't seem that interested in football generally and doesn't bother to pretend that he is. Absolutely fair enough in my view. He's doing a brilliant job for the team and seems like a great team mate.",Arsenal,Yes,jes3swm,t1_jerwslw
"he wouldn't elevate us. at best he's depth, but I think he's fallen off this last year",Arsenal,Yes,jetkedf,t1_jeth765
Nah,Arsenal,Yes,jetpd5p,t1_jetmt4v
"If it happens, it's definitely going to be one of those tricky away games like Soton, Everton etc. They likely would have dropped points against Palace if Olise didn't have his bird brain moment.",Arsenal,Yes,jetkkmr,t1_jetgein

"People don't pay attention to how us and spurs are basically in exactly the same place financially and people seem to have forgotten they finished above us every year since the leicester season. 

That can't happen again to us. 

And they can't establish themselves as a more commercially successful club than us that would be a huge issue for us.",Arsenal,Yes,jeu63qy,t1_jeu5bhk
"I think it's niave to say Spurs can't build on success, we've seen them build on it to get them into this conversation for top 4 year on year.

Did we think 20 years ago we would see Spurs finish ahead of us 6 years in a row?

Would we have predicted a CL final for them?

We should never forget that happened.

It took one good manager and a few lucky decisions in the transfer market and they went from midtable PL obscurity to above us in many measures of success.

Yes, they've fallen multiple times at the final hurdle of actually winning something, but the very fact they made it to that hurdle is something that should concern us massively.

United's finances are well known, of course they've overreached with their wages, but they aren't going anywhere regardless of how many players they have to let go on frees this summer or pay to leave.

And that's if a takeover doesn't happen, which it looks very likely.

Spurs have financial stability but they can't consistently spend big to get themselves back to the top if they fall out, they could get trapped in a way that united can't. 

United if not this year, will always be able to compete financially and will always be a factor in the race for the top 4 if not more.",Arsenal,Yes,jeub9y6,t1_jeu7aa3
"We‚Äôve never thrashed Utd and it‚Äôs really frustrating. City have often scored 4+ goals against them. Same with Liverpool. Even Spurs destroyed them at OT, and Chelsea beat them 4-0 once. Our best result are two 3-0 wins in Premier League era",Arsenal,Yes,jerht4o,t1_jergvxc
The first United goal was really good tbf. The second one was just bullshit corner defending,Arsenal,Yes,jergxob,t1_jergvxc
Yeah should never have been that close. We did basically constantly attack the last 30-35 mins it could have been worse for them if we clicked more. Would have been such an annoying draw,Arsenal,Yes,jerhioy,t1_jergvxc

This is the correct approach. Just nervous is all.,Arsenal,Yes,jevvfvj,t1_jeuchkv
Maybe but in the reverse fixture we played our best 1V1 defender as LB against Salah and it worked. I think he had like 0 touches in the box or something,Arsenal,Yes,jerkgqk,t1_jerkc04
No matter how we line up we are not keeping more than 55% possession at Anfield,Arsenal,Yes,jerjb62,t1_jerj6l6
"Agreed. Get zinchenko to do his thing, try stay with salah. We defend man to man with the ‚Äúback 3‚Äù if zinchenko is stranded, and partey covers a ton of space. I love Tierney but we don‚Äôt need to start him, play our game not theirs",Arsenal,Yes,jerou97,t1_jerjrvi
">not to have ball all the time and control the tempo which goes against everything Arteta has built

This is not true. Arteta has shown that he is willing to pragmatic if the situation really demands it. We did a very similar thing in the reverse fixture with Tomiyasu and that was at home and when we did not have to play Holding",Arsenal,Yes,jerjxq0,t1_jerjrvi
">Mate, this Holding out bandwagon needs to die

I dont think its unreasonable to be worried about the 4th choice poor ball playing CB to be playing against Liverpool away

"Boehly clearly wanted a completely fresh start where he implemented all of his own guys, which from a business viewpoint makes sense. When someone takes over a company, there's usually a reshuffle.

But you either do it immediately with a clear idea of who/what you do want to put in place before the transfer window opens, or give it a season while you figure out what you want to put in place. Doing it right after a big spend transfer window so that the new guy has players he doesn't want and no preseason, is madness.",Arsenal,Yes,jerkawd,t1_jerhzw7
"Genuine question, would he have succeeded at Chelsea? Or shit?

The first two things are what people said about Trossard too,Arsenal,Yes,jetl7wv,t1_jetkedf
"I'm not saying it isn't a red.

"he‚Äôd be in the starting lineup by next season lol you do not pay that money for a substitute im sorry. Arsenal don‚Äôt pay that money for a substitute, let me clarify haha",Arsenal,Yes,jev73d2,t1_jev5wzg
"Yes Spurs have undoubtedly done well to make themselves a ""top 6"" side that gets invited to the Super League. And you are right in saying that we shouldn't discount their ability to improve further.

But the fact still is that as a club they still have a few levels to go. Actually having a sustained period of a few years where they are a top 2 team in the league and win some PL titles and become one of the top 5 or so CL contenders in that period is uncharted waters for them. They might get there, they might not. They have been better than us for 6 years and consistently reached CL but they have yet to use that to elevate themselves to that level. There seems to be a sense that they've plateaued and making another top 4 would be a continuation of that plateau. They can't really attract those true elite players. 

United, on the other hand, have reached that territory several times and they were considered a European powerhouse on the same level as Barca or Bayern as recently as 2012. After Fergie retired, they've failed to get any projects going at all and generally see-sawed between CL and EL. But you do get this sense that if they do get something going, they will probably take it all the way. And with ETH, there does seem to be a resemblance of something being built. The culture is better, their play is better and they won a cup which will buy him some time to build something. If they do get CL, it will put them on the track of where we know they are capable of going all the way. They have always had the financial might to buy elite players too.",Arsenal,Yes,jev61ss,t1_jeub9y6
"Bogey teams exist, no matter what high standards fc supporters might think.

"We outplayed them but they took their one decent chance superbly and got one ridiculous one that doesn't get scored 99 times out of a hundred.

But we won and we won just as they thought they'd got a draw. If you're going to do it late then you might as well do it very, very late and maximise the pain for the opposition.",Arsenal,Yes,jerhnqd,t1_jerhioy
"The problem there is that they won't win the league like that because the lower teams will just be happy to let no one have the ball and play for a draw and he's been brought in to play 'the united way'.

Also you're right on the age. This may be the equivalent of Auba in his first season under Arteta but Rashford is about to get the Auba level stupid contract which means it's highly likely the late auba fun is going to hit Man U soon and I don't see the united board sanctioning selling Rashford over keeping ETH.",Arsenal,Yes,jerz92u,t1_jerxq0t
"I assume DDG can play possession, he just doesn't for Man U. But yeah they need way more than just dumping Ronaldo for their clearout.",Arsenal,Yes,jesl444,t1_jes1w6m
"Nice find, it‚Äôll probably take a bit post Covid for finances to go back to normal before anything changes. What annoys me is although it‚Äôs unfair, the spending is good for the league so nothing will change.

"Are you serious? Players like Ramsdale are part of the journey we began in that transfer window, who have taken us to the level where we are leading the league with 8 points. But that doesn‚Äôt mean we keep doing the same transfer policy if we want to achieve higher goals. It‚Äôs called evolution, when you reach a new level you go for better alternatives in order to improve. Pretty basic stuff",Arsenal,Yes,jetu9xn,t1_jets8sf
Wenger must be proud of this Artetaball can‚Äôt get much better than that days.,Arsenal,Yes,jev0oqo,t1_jeur2m3
"They do play keep ball to kill off games once they've taken a comfortable lead but that's when they are trying to mount challenges on multiple fronts.

But I don't know if they are defensive overall. They still do amazing damage in attack and do it with a lot of technical skill. Pep's City sides occupy 4 out of top 10 spots in the list of goals by team in a PL season.

His Barca teams were scoring over 100 goals a season on average.

I found the VDB Spanish sides somewhat defensive even with all their possession and quality. Generally passing about to keep the ball but Pep's sides I'd associate with relentless chance creation.

"The first one makes no sense. It's not like Qatar decides who should get the world cup. They can influence some things (like where do they get to stay, which stadiums he gets to play in etc.

It's Fifa who oversees the tournament, selects refs (who come from all around the world), etc. We would need to assume that Qatar paid bribed Fifa and all the refs to help deliver Messi this world cup for this conspiracy to work.

Besides, even with every ref in the pocket, it's not like they can guarantee anything. Unless they paid Gvardiol to lose Messi in their 1 on 1, paid the Dutch to lose in the shoot out, paid the French to lose in the shootout, etc.

Maybe the simpler explanation is that Argentina was just really good. They won the Copa America and were unbeaten in 35 matches going into the world cup.

"it's not a team award though it's an individual award. it depends on how it's measured. individually he is putting the ball between the sticks more often than anyone thought humanly possible. for many of us, particularly in this group, the award should go to the player who making their team the best team in the country. that's probably the camp I am also in, which is why I though it was KDB for the last like 10 years...",Arsenal,Yes,jerjq4m,t1_jerjfj0
"This kind of analysis is really lazy. 

Using this guy's logic , signing Partey in 20/21 wasnt really that big of a deal because that season ( before  ESR and  Odegaard ) our midfield was dreadful and was the least creative midfield in the league. So that should mean that Partey didnt really improve our midfield or somehow made it worse.

 But thats not on Partey. It was more to do with the fact that Ramsey left and Ozil and Guendouzi were isolated without bringing in any proper replacements leaving us with effectively 0 'creative' players.",Arsenal,Yes,jesx7i3,t1_jerq46l

Mate...,Arsenal,Yes,jerlpqo,t1_jerlmw7
"You might have noticed he seems to have got over that slump recently.

But sure let's take away our starting left back and one of the most important and transformational players this season to replace him with a guy who will give us *less* control of the ball and leave just as much space in behind unless we deliberately ask him not to play his natural game.

There's a reason we played Tomi instead of Tierney last time.",Arsenal,Yes,jerlvi1,t1_jerlkse
"Perhaps it‚Äôs why we want both him & Rice. Just watching them play it feels as if Caicedo has the ability to evade the press a lot better than Rice & tends to turn to find the man with the pass whereas Rice tends to pass back to avoid it. 

Then Rice‚Äôs pace & power is monstrous and suits the Xhaka role a lot more than being deeper and dictating the play. 

That being said, both could play there and have done before - but I think the future fit would be Rice at 8 with Caicedo at 6. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever want a flair player as the second 8 unless we‚Äôre chasing a game",Arsenal,Yes,jerksxy,t1_jerkee8
"Why not? The squad doesn‚Äôt need major surgery. We probably need max 4 players in the summer at a push, after that we‚Äôll probably only need to add 1/2 at a time after that - and that‚Äôs how you know you‚Äôre in a healthy position",Arsenal,Yes,jerl0fl,t1_jerkpbu
"Honestly yeah I could see us doing that. We‚Äôre not in that situation where we needed 6-7 players to overhaul a entire squad anymore, it‚Äôs really going to be about 2-3 top quality players who allow us to maintain our position as title contenders.",Arsenal,Yes,jerlg2v,t1_jerkpbu
"Caicedo is terrific on the ball & setting tempo, the way I see him play is more like a 6 for us and Rice‚Äôs physicality & motor is more of an 8. 

Rice is the best signing we can make this summer, he would be one of the biggest & most transformative signings in the clubs recent history. He‚Äôs nowhere near him in terms of ability as no-one is, but it‚Äôd be a Vieira type impact for us if we sign him",Arsenal,Yes,jerkkx9,t1_jerk8pe

"I will say that I think Mikel was initially saved by the lack of fans in 20/21.

I'm not saying that he's unprofessional. I don't think Arteta would have him if he was. He just treats football like a job and does his job very well.",Arsenal,Yes,jerqrbn,t1_jerq6oy
"Surely not? I thought people really rated Trossard. I did.

I like Tielemans for sure. He could fit the bill if Leicester overall didn't look so flat this year - we'd probably have him closer to the conversation especially if we were in a top 4 race rather than a title one",Arsenal,Yes,jetr23t,t1_jetl7wv
why would he be in the starting line up if all 3 of those players are better than him?,Arsenal,Yes,jev88nq,t1_jev73d2

Nketiah is undeniably a fan favourite also.",Arsenal,Yes,jetyoqb,t1_jetx3qq
"We only signed him to an 18 month deal.

The reason he left Chelsea is because he wasn't playing in the last year of his contract, which is exactly what's going to happen here next season.",Arsenal,Yes,jetb323,t1_jet0akq

"The refereeing at the WC was definitely a bit biased though we can all agree. He has plenty more of you want to follow, if not, no problem",Arsenal,Yes,jetsa39,t1_jetogbj
"I get that, but I would prefer players to stop playacting to get attention from the referee (regardless of the fact that referees encourage it by giving attention to the playacting). This is just my assessment of where I want the game to be, not where it is now. But I understand where you're coming from, too.",Arsenal,Yes,jeu8y15,t1_jeu5ajj
"It's why it was always Messi over Ronaldo. Messi, in every single team, elevates everyone around him whilst also being good at putting the ball in the goal.

Haaland is not in that category. Nothing about this city team, for all intents and purposes, seems better off for his arrival. It's pretty much the same but different. If they win the CL, it will have been a long time coming and neither more nor less likely than any other year for me.

KDB as you rightly point out has probably been the best player in the last half dozen years. This year, it's probably Saka or √òdegaard. They are so very good that the whole team is obviously and functionally better off for them, not simply different.",Arsenal,Yes,jerjxv4,t1_jerjq4m
"Putting the ball in the net isn't the sole measure of being a good player, even if it's a useful indicator?",Arsenal,Yes,jerq7kd,t1_jerkv7i
He most definitely is. Any 20 goal a season striker is worth 20 points minimum. Compare him and someone like Gray. You don't think Kane promises 7 more wins than Gray with his goals?,Arsenal,Yes,jeu72sm,t1_jeu6sp9
Oh I hope I'm wrong then,Arsenal,Yes,jet6mhj,t1_jet5z6a
"Both Xhaka and KdB play as wide/advanced midfielders in a base 433, ahead of a single pivot.

They also have the same number of goals.

One of them, however, has 13 assists, and is a superior player.

KdB does typically play on the right, as √òdegaard does, but all three of them are left-footed, and KdB switches to the left in open play even more than √òdegaard does.

Their heatmaps are pretty telling in terms of similar advancement and width.

As to Sch√§r, he also has the benefit of being far more experienced, and playing in a much more defensively solid team. Saliba is a lot more exposed in our setup, and laying those dropped points at his feet is-- singular.",Arsenal,Yes,jeshg95,t1_jes511l
I don‚Äôt disagree but arteta will play zinny,Arsenal,Yes,jetdr8r,t1_jet4hqr
I really think those issues are exaggerated. I thought he was alright,Arsenal,Yes,jeunal6,t1_jeuhapx
We have to outdo spurs/Brighton as they have the 5th highest potential points total. That total is 79 so 80 points is currently mathematically enough to secure it.,Arsenal,Yes,jerj9h7,t1_jerj5qk
Why are you so sure?,Arsenal,Yes,jesqkb2,t1_jesq2lw
">But in that game Zinchenko wasn't available iirc.

Yeah this is true my bad but Tomi still completely neutered Salah and that was one of the biggest reasons we won imo

>Also Liv's midfield is there to be dominated

I think this is kind of overblown. Liverpool have the worst midfield of the big 6 but its still a decent midfield especially at Anfield. They managed to 60+% possession against us at Emirates and maintained roughly 50% possesion against Real Madrid over two legs. I feel like people are significantly downplaying the Anfield atmosphere and are kind of forgetting that we seem to have a mental blockade against Liverpool especially at Anfield",Arsenal,Yes,jerl48h,t1_jerkm57
"Rice has never played as a #8. He doesn't have the passing of Xhaka, he has a good engine but lacks the agility of Caicedo. Vieira's technique was light years ahead. Rice also has no verticality in his passing.

Good player but if he played in the serie A he wouldn't have this hype around him.",Arsenal,Yes,jerkrk2,t1_jerkkx9
"My cousin's girl's team didn't think so. And my cousin pretty blunt with me if I embarrassed her. But then again you can't generalise a group of people, am I right, Duty?",Arsenal,Yes,jet8pr2,t1_jet6ris
That was more in spite of Milner. Liverpool got lucky with Injuries so they rarely had to rely on him,Arsenal,Yes,jeru1mn,t1_jertviw
"To be fair, before the cash people generally quite liked them as they were almost the dictionary definition of a yo yo club (going all the way down the leagues and back up again) yet their fans still turned up (ironic now) and of course they had to share a city with United.

So when they got cash (and I'm seeing this a bit with Newcastle) there was a sense of 'fair enough, they deserve it' that no one ever felt about those racist fuckers at Chelsea.

Add that to the fact they've spent *so* much, they've probably cheated as well and their old fans keep quiet while their new fans are more plastic than the flags they wave and they're just seen as a sad fact of life, like wasps at a picnic",Arsenal,Yes,jewnd6e,t1_jeuit4o
I'm not sure Fergies pride would allow him to be seen to be backing a failure.,Arsenal,Yes,jetyigq,t1_jetybcu
"Because the club would‚Äôve went through hell to pay ¬£88m for him? He wouldn‚Äôt be some rotational player.

‚Äúlet‚Äôs break out transfer record for a player who won‚Äôt start most games‚Äù does not make sense. Down the line he‚Äôd start on LW even though i can‚Äôt see it, i just don‚Äôt personally rate him that highly",Arsenal,Yes,jev96zc,t1_jev88nq
"> just wished we could completely destroy them once though

Maybe next year when they inevitably ditch Ten Hag!",Arsenal,Yes,jeripxp,t1_jerie68
Nketiah is far from a fan favourite. People are saying he should be 4th choice striker. He's 100000% underrated,Arsenal,Yes,jetyu7d,t1_jetyoqb
"I get what you mean but sadly the key to that happening, in terms of the players incentives, is refs being able to recognise things without the play acting.

Remember when that ref in the Southampton game basically punished jesus for being honest in the penalty area and not going down?",Arsenal,Yes,jex5gly,t1_jeu8y15
"Exactly. You and I aren‚Äôt in agreement of how we think this ought to be judged. But it being an individual award means that‚Äôs open to the other interpretation. It‚Äôs subjective. It‚Äôs not like saying which team has the most points over 38 games which no one can argue with. It‚Äôs like in the 20/21 season who was a better manager, pep for winning the league with a squad bought for a billion pounds or dyche or potter for keeping burnley and Brighton up on shoestring budgets? Or someone in between who played brilliant football and finished four or five places above where everyone expected them to based on spending - like poch did at spurs   - One could argue it either way, I don‚Äôt think there is a right or wrong way to determine who is the better player for the year and there are still people claiming Ronaldo‚Äôs hat tricks in Saudi make him untouchable compared to Messi.",Arsenal,Yes,jerplyv,t1_jerjxv4

"We don‚Äôt want agility or nous in that left 8 role, we want a monster. If we did, we would be seeing Vieira & ESR being slowly integrated into it this season, it just hasn‚Äôt been the case. 

There‚Äôs more evidence of Rice succeeding in that 8 role with us than there ever was of Ramsdale being good with his feet for example - he has all the ingredients to replicate then become a miles better version of Xhaka in that slot. Add the intangibles to that and you could not ask for a better fit. 

It‚Äôll be a gigantic blow if we miss out on him, I think he‚Äôs severely underrated",Arsenal,Yes,jerkye1,t1_jerkrk2

"I don‚Äôt think we actually do. The idea is great but I think this is where our system differs a lot to Pep‚Äôs. 

Personally I‚Äôm not too moved by Mac Allister except when he‚Äôs in that pocket of space but I think Mikel values the physicality Xhaka brings & his constant running as opposed to running a mirror of Odegaard‚Äôs side. 

We‚Äôll have to see in the summer and how we evolve for next season but from what I‚Äôve seen and where I predict we‚Äôre trying to go I think we want Rice as our left 8 for the foreseeable future, and feel that he can significantly improve & showcase more of his skillset than being lumbered down in midfield with Noble & Soucek since he was a teen",Arsenal,Yes,jerlo5k,t1_jerlcup

A recently fit Gabriel Jesus retaining his ""utter pain in the arse"" factor by way of dribbling, deceiving and being in the right place., which we all love about him. The trickiness of Trossard is always a joy to behold. 

A commentator once said ""You've always got a chance when you've got Theirry Henry"". As true as that was - for he was utterly immense - I am beginning to believe that we've got a chance whilst we have several of ours. 

For years and years we lacked this variation. For years and years we ranted about commentators going on about how our opponents ""wanted it more than us"".

But we've all got to admit - when we watch OUR players wanting it more than the oppo, it feels flippin' sweet. It's not Brexit without the shitty leg-breaking fouls and we're getting there. It's balling. 

I've dreamed of such a team. A team not only with good instinctive pass-and-move patterns of play, but with work ethic, nuisance value, hunger, maximising existing assets, and simply *getting there first*. 

It may sound silly, but it has given my own mental health an immense boost. Especially as I wondered where the heck we were going 18-20 months ago amidst multiple bereavements in my family. It just feels great to have stuck around, kept watching, never abandoned Arsenal, and to have seen a great big sunshine rise over a hill that seemed so hard to climb. 

Anyway, I wish you all a good remainder of the weekend or indeed beginning of a new week, wherever you shall be. Take care, friends.",Arsenal,No,jep60rf,t3_129ed6z

"Good afternoon lads, overcast day here in North London today. 

Mathematically city can only reach a total of 94 points if they win all of their remaining 10 games. Therefore the title winning threshold to guarantee it is currently 95 points. 

We are 75.79% of the way to this target, each three points we earn is a huge contributor to winning it. 

A 23 point haul is required, which is at least 7 wins and 2 draws from our remaining 9 games. 

Tottenham/Brighton can only reach 79 points from their remaining 10/12 games respectively. Therefore the threshold for top 4 is 80 points. 

We are 90% of the way to this target. Brighton will almost certainly drop more points, so this will likely reduce radically. If we assume 75 points (the standard total) we are 96% of the way to champions league football.",Arsenal,No,jenplfq,t3_129ed6z

"In the midst of our present injury crisis, coming off an international break, that was just about the best showing from our bench options we could have hoped for. They let us give our crucial players some rest and refreshment against a bottom-third side as we enter the final stretch.

Jorginho took 30' so Thomas could put his feet up after an hour, and rest whatever was ailing him in Ghana's last match.

Holding played the full 90', which not only bought Saliba more time ot heal, but allowed White to stay at RB, where he was typically excellent, and snuck in at the back post to score what turned out to be the match winner.

Trossard played 90' so that Jesus and Saka could split 60'/30', which is pretty much the first rest Bukayo has had since he was a teenager.

We even got a little Vieira/ESR advanced 8 pair teaser at the end.

Yes, White and Thomas did have to do quite a lot of work covering for Holding, and he didn't show himself to great advantage on the goal we allowed (though that was more about a pathetic attempt at a clearance and an unfortunate deflection off Zinchenko than it was simply about Holding getting backed in); Jorginho got exposed there as well, and it's probably not a goal happens if Thomas is on the pitch.

But the point, of course, is that they did *enough*: enough to give us a relatively tidy three points, and give more important players their rest.

City lost 1-0 at Anfield but beat Liverpool at home 4-1. We've already beaten Liverpool at home 3-2 and a loss at Anfield isn't beyond the realms of possibility. It would mean, just like City, we've gotten 3/6 points from them.

Regardless of what happens at Anfield, the real title decider is coming up at the Etihad. Remember we lost to City at our place and we shouldn't have. You can't be in a title challenge and give your only other challenger a 12 point swing, leaving with 0/6 points. It simply means we need a result at the Etihad, to me that decides everything.

Again narrative is really important going into this game. We both win all out and we could potentially go there with an 11 point lead on the board.

And players will start to lose confident in the style of football we played today if arteta change tactic to counterattack football every time we lose.

ETH process? **Bullshit**.

Pundits say **ETH style is like pep and us**, **but why they play like spurs** counterattack football? Because they are not ready? If they are in process then it is okay to lose while playing the style they want to play.

Like respect the fact that it's Liverpool away, that it's a ground we've not done well at, and change our formation to deal with that. 

So Tierney as LB, Xhaka drops back to play in a double-pivot with Partey, and Odegaard as our lone 10.

">I was just laying here in bed thinking about how we're (potentially, but deep down we all know we're) going to finally get ours this season 

ANULO MUFA of course.

I think the issue simply is that nobody believes it yet. Everyone here looks at City, and looks at our fixtures list, and looks at the table, and looks at injuries or potential injuries, and then thinks back to previous painful seasons and is just waiting for it to all fall apart.

If we had to put our house on it, no doubt the majority here would back City to win the league.

There won't be a release until we all believe it's actually about to happen.",Arsenal,Yes,jencz8v,t1_jenbwhi
I think we got nervous or city pressed us too hard and we lost possession in bad places leading goals. Not having partey also affected the way we build up from the back,Arsenal,Yes,jenim8j,t1_jeniepz
"Yeah, from what I remember there were little individual mistakes that people made that led to goals for City. Like Tomis back pass",Arsenal,Yes,jenjdcc,t1_jeniepz
"Injuries and bozo moments are easy way to look at it but ultimately Pep realised that our ability to play out from the press was diminished with a player like J20.  

He could press the hell out of our defence because no one was able to receive  the ball with that amount of pressure forcing us to go sideways leading to errors. This is why Partey is the key piece to beat/drawing city at the Etihad.",Arsenal,Yes,jenr9gv,t1_jeniepz
"Actually, we did something that day that just doesn't happen to City. We kept the ball from them. They had 37% possession at the Emirates - that doesn't happen to City. They don't let it happen, unless it is beyond their control.

We lost that day because of defensive naivety, a lack of experience and a killer edge. I also feel like we have a bit of a mental block regarding City that we need to get over.",Arsenal,Yes,jentan1,t1_jeniepz
"We lost due to individual moments. Tomiyasu gave away a goal, nketiah missed a good chance, xhaka fucked up two excellent goal scoring opportunities and Gabriel gave the ball away for the second goal",Arsenal,Yes,jenj87c,t1_jeniepz

"Arteta may be using a similar shape to what Pep used in his early PL years but I think the brands of football are distinctly different.

Arteta has said ESR and Vieira can both play both of those advanced midfield roles; there's no real difference there.,Arsenal,Yes,jenlr38,t1_jenlgdm
"Did a little BBQ research project on that a few months ago, and concluded that ESR makes marginally more sense in the right-8 with the current lineup, and worth noting that‚Äôs where he‚Äôs appeared in the rehab u-21 games, etc.

In possession, if you look at the left like a rotating diamond of a pushed LB -> left-8 -> wing -> striker, Vieira can potentially project well in all four rotation spots, which helps Martinelli cut in, Zinchenko join the line more, etc. Vieira has a thing to his game (deep power crosses with his left) that we haven‚Äôt seen unleashed yet, and him doing that from the Zinchenko spot will result in some goals, as well Zinchenko joining the front line more. Meanwhile ESR isn‚Äôt quite as interesting as a crosser/through-baller further back.

On the right, he can stay up and be more direct (i.e. Odegaard doesn't flip with White often), and stay in that right-channel, and has some good chemistry with Saka. In the mid-block, that means he‚Äôs also in the front-2 (with the striker) instead of the mid-four, which is better for him, too.

Still would be fun to see ESR/Martinelli flipping and causing havoc together on the left. It's all marginal, but I dig him over there on the right.",Arsenal,Yes,jeo448w,t1_jenlgdm

"If we win the league this season this sub won‚Äôt have to post useless games like the CL victory against barca in the first leg where we ended up getting knocked out anyway or the Welbeck winner against Leicester where we ended up bottling the league anymore, tears in my eyes",Arsenal,Yes,jen0uxk,t1_jen0fhc

I think you need Jesus to stretch Liverpool and make them afraid of the ball in behind.,Arsenal,Yes,jeraqzz,t1_jer6eex
"I think Jesus will start, only played 60 mins while Trossard played the full 90 (probably compensation from Arteta because he plans to start Jesus). Jesus thrives in these big games, not to mention he has a great record and always has a blinder against Liverpool.",Arsenal,Yes,jer7piw,t1_jer6eex
Literally any front 3 made up of those players I‚Äôll be happy. Whoever doesn‚Äôt start comes on as a sub and causes problems against an exhausted Liverpool back line.,Arsenal,Yes,jera0oj,t1_jer6eex

Darwin and Gakpo are good players. Nunez especially is going to be a fantastic player for Liverpool.,Arsenal,Yes,jen0eib,t1_jemzhwp
Darwin is on 18 G/A. His team is just shit.,Arsenal,Yes,jen135t,t1_jemzhwp
"Cucurella was arguably the best LB in the league last season. But again, one season wonders exist all the time.",Arsenal,Yes,jemzl7a,t1_jemzhwp
"Tbf, every PL team is loaded and any good player would cost a bomb.

We got lucky with Trossard, thanks to his contractual situation and Chelsea for going all in for Mudryk.

We got lucky with Jesus and Zinchenko because of Arteta's relation with the players. Doubt City would sell us anyone in the future.",Arsenal,Yes,jemzr31,t1_jemzhwp
Darwin will come good eventually. He has the tools to be a prolific striker. Gakpo has shown some flashes. Joao Felix is a legit talent playing for a garbage team at the moment. Don‚Äôt have high hopes for the rest of the players you listed though.,Arsenal,Yes,jen02du,t1_jemzhwp
"it's going to happen to us too. It's impossible to avoid bad buys when your optimal signing is being chased by Aston Villa (remember when they were confident of signing ESR?)

Having to gamble on flash in the pan players like Mudryk means a lot of expensive mistakes that are pretty difficult to recover from.

Chelsea still haven't recovered from Lukaku. West ham is now a relegation battler because they tried to replace Antonio with Scammaca and failed. Rodgers is showing again at Leicester how bad he is at talent id and shit has learned the hard way that you should never buy a player for the express purpose of strengthening you bench (easiest way to create deadwood).

We will have challenges deciding who to take Xhaka's place. You can see we've already failed with Vieira, ESR, and to some extent Sambi.

Unlike most, I genuinely don't believe we are looking to sign Rice. He's right footed, and isn't a Partey replacement (since he's more box-to-box). That will be the first opportunity to get it wrong and unbalance the first team. Finding that left footed B2B player with the same level of press intensity with be difficult, and when we do, odds are that we'll be forced to play way over the odds for him.

Jury is still out on Kiwior's potential. Tomi now officially being Injury prone also needs to be replaced.

In the next 2 seasons, We'll have to replace,

Xhaka
Trossard
Jorginho
Tierney
Tomi
Partey (if ""you know what"" ends up happening).

Screw that up and suddenly you're a panicky midfield that can't string together 4 passes and an exposed backline that can't stop counter attacks.

It's pretty easy to see how quickly fortunes can change.",Arsenal,Yes,jen603n,t1_jemzhwp
Felix the best one that there by a big gap and he‚Äôs on the same list as some of those players haha,Arsenal,Yes,jen2jrg,t1_jemzhwp
"I think Trossard has to start as he plays well against big teams, especially Liverpool. Then Jesus has to start because he loves scoring against them and they're petrified of him. Saka is a guaranteed starter if he's fit. Martinelli has to start too as he's in hot form. 

Fuck it, we'll have to play 12 men.",Arsenal,Yes,jen9v2c,t1_jen8vmb

"That‚Äôs assuming we get 3 points at Anfield, no?",Arsenal,Yes,jeo38wn,t1_jenyymx
"Not quite. For instance if we lose at the Etihad and then City draw a game we can afford another loss. So we don‚Äôt quite need to match. 

I do think our points lead is a bit misleading. If City beat us at home and win their game in hand it is only a 2 point game. Really need at least a draw, which is a big ask at the Etihad.",Arsenal,Yes,jeo4g2y,t1_jenyymx
Why? The traditional big 6 being out of CL is kind of good for us.,Arsenal,Yes,jeonbfs,t1_jeol6m7
Why did you want a draw?,Arsenal,Yes,jeom08j,t1_jeol6m7
"It‚Äôs only soft in terms of him not getting murdered by a tackle and winning it; Ayling left his leg high up, contact was clear and the pen was clear still.",Arsenal,Yes,jen4b32,t1_jen3wbw
"I still can't see it being anything other than a pen.

It's not like it was a slight scrape and then Jesus leaps to the ground, he was running and his knee got kicked.

I don't even think it's a dive either, which you alluded to, but he was fouled and that put him down.",Arsenal,Yes,jen6xxm,t1_jen3wbw
That was a clear pen. Ayling's leg touched his knee. No debate.,Arsenal,Yes,jen7tyb,t1_jen3wbw

"Well, players want to play.

No one loves sitting on the bench. 

While a ton of footballers are overly confident in their own ability, it is then the job of that players agent or other reps to find a spot for a player where they aren't a Reiss Nelson level talent competing with Saka.

A big reason Saka, Martinelli etc have improved while you see people here doubting Vieira is because the former have been able to play.

18 months ago plenty of people here said Arteta dislikes young players, dislikes Gabi, can't coach an attack etc.",Arsenal,Yes,jeo9nwj,t1_jeo7uyt
Well it looks like Rice and Caicedo prefer us so those are good signs you‚Äôre right. It probably also depends on the position because they see we need long term midfielders but if they can‚Äôt get playing time then Arteta won‚Äôt be enough to sway them,Arsenal,Yes,jeo8k0e,t1_jeo7uyt
"It‚Äôs like the peak Arsene era; do you want to develop under a great coach known for developing young players alongside great players, or do you want to earn more money going somewhere else?

Honestly even Arteta is not at Pep and Klopp level. He is showing signs of great manager but let him win few trophies before we compare with him those two,Arsenal,Yes,jeovw5c,t1_jeovfz9
"eh idk, ten hag isn't even playing his ideal football bc man utd's squad is so tragic. the antony fetishism is concerning tho with talent ID but unlike potter there's a more substantial 'trust the process' with him. i hate saying this btw bc i only want the worst for man utd but i think they'll come good unfortunately. arteta is still the best pep pupil by some distance tho and the most likely to overcome and better his mentor",Arsenal,Yes,jeoxanr,t1_jeovfz9

Yeah ngl if we mess up with xhaka we may end up like Liverpool with Elliott physicality is 70% of in the English league,Arsenal,Yes,jenfyvy,t1_jenekgg
I don't think so. The main attribute Xhaka has that we probably won't be able to replace/replicate is his stamina and durability. He can pretty reliably play every game and he doesn't pick up injuries.,Arsenal,Yes,jenf74f,t1_jenekgg

Well more like 50% supportive 25/25 on neutral and Artetaout.",Arsenal,Yes,jen1e70,t1_jen128f
"That burnley run which we ended by beating chelsea 3-1 was miserable, a significant chunk of the fanbase (I'd say like 30%) mainly because Tuchel and Ancelotti were available then.

The worst was definitely post City 5-0 drubbing in the 21/22 season. Anything Arteta out on this subreddit was insanely popular. I'd say about 80% of fans were vehemently arteta out by that point. We'd come off the back of a miserable season and started the new season in the worse way possible. It's easy to say in hindsight injuries and the terrible squad had caused those miserable 3 straight losses, but a lot of people's vision was completely clouded by:

1. Spurs being 1st under nuno after winning 3 matches (didn't last long lol) while we sat 20th (below norwich, no goals scored etc.)

2. Most pundits and rival fans taking easy potshots at us because we'd been bad for 2 seasons now, criticizing every signing made, (this is before most of the arsenal fans realized that most pundits didn't have a clue of what we were talking about.)

3. We left signings VERY late after the prem had started. At the start of the Prem most fans were furious that 'not enough' had been done. 

Common narratives at that time from the transfer market that exacerbated everything surrounding the club:

 -  Ben White is servely overpriced and too short to win ariel duels, he's too ""soft"" and going to be another ""John stones"". (The height bit came from google which listed White at 1.82m then, also what are Arsenal doing signing a random english brighton player for 50m when Varane only cost 40m etc.)

 - Links to Ramsdale were stupid and severely overpriced, he'd conceded over 70 goals the previous season and gotten relegated 3 times in row. Even though this seems insignificant now, _a lot_ of fans were pissed because we had just sold Emi martinez the previous season.

 - Lack of attacking midfielder. It's important to remember that at that point of time the narrative was that Martin Odegaard was going back to Madrid and not coming back to Arsenal. A LOT of fans were still divided on Ode and whether he was really good enough. The quoted price was 52m - which seems like a steal now, but a lot of people were still saying he wasn't good enough etc. (remember we got him for 34m). Most fans thought that was unrealistic. A lot of fans wanted maddison instead. Earlier in the season we had missed out on Buendia (lol) and half the sub was in arms losing a player to Aston Villa. This was made worst by selling Martinez from the previous season, and the fact that we had been drubbed by villa the previous season as well. Maddison was quoted by all sources to be at 80m or some ridiculous price that we couldn't pay.

 - It's also important to remember that the transfer reputation of Arsenal was VERY different. Especially Chelsea were signing a lot of players then. To make matters worse, Chelsea had also won the CL. Fans had nowhere close the same level of trust in our scouts. The narrative was that we were still skint and didn't spent. Most fans thought we should've spent more and were incredibly angry that the club had failed to pay up for Aouar the previous seasons and gotten outbid by Aston Villa. In hindsight, it's amazing that we didn't.",Arsenal,Yes,jen3k7b,t1_jen128f
"Me one of the very few who stood by Arteta  during the low, yes I was abused by a lot of ppl here. I would say 30% still back him at those lowest point.",Arsenal,Yes,jen5b8q,t1_jen128f

I wasn't on reddit then, but I did keep up with twitter and most of the arsenal podcasts. There was a lot of frustration and a lot of people were 'Arteta out' , I was too.

Stones is rb though he just inverts into dm with ball,Arsenal,Yes,jen8kf0,t1_jen5xdu
Difference is they are way worse than we ever were and it's blatant that Potter is a large part of the problem as the issues Chelsea now have are the issues Brighton used to have and stopped having when he left. As bad as the early Arteta days were he did at least win an FA cup to give himself a bit more time and had people who knew him talking about how much of a genius he is which Potter doesn't have and Potter has no connection to the club and that probably also bought Arteta some patience,Arsenal,Yes,jend8r7,t1_jencus7
"Chelsea currently has a far, far better squad in terms of individual quality than our team when Arteta first took over.",Arsenal,Yes,jendjhz,t1_jencus7
"Wanting someone out doesn't mean you think their a shitty coach. You can be a bad fit for a role. Or you can get a job at the wrong time.

Also the question is why are Potter teams always underperforming xG? You could excuse it cause of player quality (relative) at Brighton. The fact it's carried over suggests it's a Potter problem.",Arsenal,Yes,jene36k,t1_jencus7
"Arteta won an FA Cup in his first half season of management and the only thing that kept him his job in 2021 was the lack of fans and the poor squad.
 He's an exception",Arsenal,Yes,jenefmi,t1_jencus7
"Brighton fans used to be frustrated with the lack of attacking football under him, and add to that Chelsea being where attacking players go to die - terrible combination, as much as I rate Potter",Arsenal,Yes,jend2hm,t1_jencus7

Willock is far behind from what Ode can offer.,Arsenal,Yes,jeninmn,t1_jenh8aw
"I would have love to have kept Willock, but that was just too good a deal for all three parties at the time.

Willock wanted to play more than we were going to play him -- especially as we were moving on √òdegaard -- Newcastle wanted a quality young midfielder, and we got offered a reasonable fee during a summer of expenditure.

This is often posed, as below, as 'upgrading from Willock to √òdegaard', and on those rather arbitrary terms, it makes even more sense; I agree with you that, in reality, we were signing √òdegaard either way.

My feeling is that the decision to sell Willock was more about a balance of a long-term projection of ESR (who signed his new deal about three weeks before we sold Willock) as an advanced/wide 8 of a more wingfieldery sort, the temporary, transitional reality of continuing to play Xhaka in a double pivot with Thomas (though this only went on a few months more before we switched to 433), and a preference for a player like Sambi or Rice (or Bruno G), who could play as an 8 or a 6 in out setup, which is something neither Xhaka nor Willock can do.

When it's viewed as 'selling Willock to buy Sambi', it looks a lot less appealing in retrospect, but it still does make *some* sense as an attempt by Arteta to get a player who he believed was also a viable backup 6, and potential long-term Thomas successor. On this assessment, Arteta probably viewed Willock as more of a 'pure 8': neither an ESR/Vieira wingfielder, nor a 6/8.",Arsenal,Yes,jenjzo2,t1_jenh8aw
"Does he even regularly start for Newcastle? We used that money to buy Odegaard, no issues with it personally. And I think the fact that he isn't great in possession was an issue for Mikel, not that he was bad, just not great at it.",Arsenal,Yes,jenhu91,t1_jenh8aw

"Trossards a more wing forward than Martinelli. He doesn‚Äôt take on his FB as much as Martinelli does.

"Yeah man, I think the game will be won in midfield. And it looked like City had an extra two men on the pitch for that 2nd half yesterday. Although Real Madrid in UCL is just a completely different level lol. I kinda wonder what place the players are in mentally rn. Like last season they were absolutely brilliant whereas now they've lost heavily to Real in UCL and City in PL. Surely their players must feel they've regressed a bit",Arsenal,Yes,jenvqns,t1_jenu3af
"You can not buy it as much as you like but Liverpool away are relegation form, Liverpool at home are third in the table and have lost once while also equalling the biggest win in premier league history",Arsenal,Yes,jeo0edg,t1_jenu3af
"Definitely shouldn't be scared about going there, the pressure is on them to get a result seeing as they're chasing but it will be an interesting test of character to see if Arteta goes pragmatic.

Edit: As Mein and Umpire pointed out, this is incorrect.",Arsenal,Yes,jeoyb4e,t1_jeoxnn7
"Er, that also has the caveat of City winning **all** games.

In other words, City has to win **all** games and then hope that at least one result of an Arsenal game ends in a draw (in your example it's the Liverpool game).

City has to rely on another team's result to go their way. Arsenal can simply focus on the actual games that they're playing in, no third-party involved whatsoever.",Arsenal,Yes,jen6yam,t1_jen5y29
"Trossard is PL-proven, developed, and has slotted in well. His transfer surpassed all my expectations.

However, you can't help but wonder 'what if?' at the prospect of Mudryk being in a more nurturing environment to develop. There is an exciting and good player there waiting to be unleashed, that much is clear.

Still, he is still an unfinished product, and would not help as much with our current title run-in.

Thankfully, it's not something that we actually need to worry about.",Arsenal,Yes,jen7pg2,t1_jen6v74
Don't over think it.,Arsenal,Yes,jen7l2s,t1_jen6v74
"No. 

The wage and fee we were offering was a lot more reasonable on the whole for a player that would take time to adapt. Arguably a similar price to someone like jesus overall. 

Chelsea went to another level paying the guaranteed bonuses and giving him a top wage. That was dumb. 

And he's gone into one of the worst environments with guaranteed playing time with s manager who hasn't got an established identity. 

That's a hard place to do well. 

Put him with arteta, his non negotiables and a very settled squad and clear hierarchy you could see a different side to mudryk. 

I don't think it was mad of arteta and co. To want him. 

As for Vs trossard+jorginho. I think when we didn't get him we pivoted to going all in for PL. Before that I think we were still hedging our bets a bit.",Arsenal,Yes,jen9do6,t1_jen6v74
"There's a difference between playing for Chelsea under Potter and playing for Arsenal under Arteta.

Chelsea's squad and individual players aren't terrible.",Arsenal,Yes,jenabys,t1_jen6v74

"Napoli and Barcelona are good.

But this is always a bit misleading. The non Bayern/PSG/Barca level teams get less revenue. So, they have weaker squads because of the difference in revenue. If Napoli competed in the PL they would add a few good squad players and be right there with us.",Arsenal,Yes,jepbpth,t1_jepb0ty

"That's not a an easy question to answer as it would require a lot of assumptions, but I can say that I am very glad that we have Trossard right now.

Guy has hit the ground running and has slotted-in so well that we look deadly going forward without Saka.

Mudryk, at the end of the day is not as PL-experienced and is having trouble adapting to the PL, but I think you cannot discount the (alleged) circumstances of his transfer to Chelsea and the fact they are historically a dead-end for young player development (see: Salah + KDB)

I'm sort of happy that we don't really have to wonder.

P.S. I am also of the opinion that landing Mudryk was not worth the price of entry.",Arsenal,Yes,jen60zt,t1_jen5rl8

Martinelli might put the final nail in TAA‚Äôs coffin.,Arsenal,Yes,jepqaqr,t1_jepq2hm
Last season still hurts for me. Brentford can have CL.,Arsenal,Yes,jepvy3b,t1_jepvh2d
Adama,Arsenal,Yes,jepx9f3,t1_jepw7qs
He did it against Leicester,Arsenal,Yes,jen2hq3,t1_jen0nea
"Damn you're absolutely right. Almost half of the outfield team, fucking crazy",Arsenal,Yes,jer4ks9,t1_jer2jho
Thanks‚Ä¶.Arsenal was my introduction to the sport in general. I started watching matches for the first time midway through college and the first one I ever watched on television was Arsenal vs. Chelsea‚Ä¶.Arsenal won that match. I‚Äôve been hooked ever since üòÅ,Arsenal,Yes,jer49n9,t1_jer202u
Winning at Anfield takes a lot of pressure from Eithihad,Arsenal,Yes,jer69a0,t1_jeqryz3
But the injuries happened after the first 20 minutes. They didn't happen in the extra time,Arsenal,Yes,jen4wa8,t1_jen0yhq
"I think it's a blessing in disguise we lost the penalty shootout. We could easily have played 120, lost 2 to injury and scraped through on pens, which would have had us playing more EL games.",Arsenal,Yes,jen5xi9,t1_jen0yhq
"Just don't see us giving up the midfield control, we can dominate the ball given Henderson and Fabinho are past it and Zinchenko is really good aerially so hopefully can deal with the long punts to Salah.",Arsenal,Yes,jen5t9t,t1_jen12o3
"I'm sure it'll be Zinchenko, but he won't be asked to deal with Salah, Gabriel will cover that side as he does so often.

The Liverpool that turned up at the Etihad yesterday couldn't keep hold of the ball at all and their only outlet was trying to counter. If they counter on us, Zinchenko won't even be at LB to be the one to deal with Salah.",Arsenal,Yes,jenaxma,t1_jen12o3
"They‚Äôve gotta play in what looks like an even bigger (more depressing) bloodbath against the blue scum at Stamford bridge midweek haha. 

If they lose to Potter‚Äôs Chelsea, I mean fucking hell. We HAVE to win at Anfield.",Arsenal,Yes,jen5ond,t1_jen4hhf
"Not for me personally. The Leicester season at this point we were 3rd, 11 points behind with a game in hand.",Arsenal,Yes,jenhbk2,t1_jenghgf
That's the wrong side,Arsenal,Yes,jeplgp7,t1_jepi2wm
"pace to run in behind, remember city with pacy wingers sane and sterling? yeahhh i dont wanna see that again",Arsenal,Yes,jepceam,t1_jepboz6
that he is better than grealish and would hence make them better (on paper at least),Arsenal,Yes,jepc2xu,t1_jepboz6
he's better than their wingers? mahrez and grealish aren't world class and don't offer anywhere near the threat of leao. last time city had truly great wingers they got 100 and 98 points consecutively,Arsenal,Yes,jepm8z6,t1_jepboz6
Salah‚Äôs work rate stank before Klopp. Personally I think Leao is different to those two. His profile is insane,Arsenal,Yes,jept8yu,t1_jepnk3l
"It's really funny with Leao he's has like 50% good games 50% trash and every game the comments here always call him either trash or class, few recognizing that he's just an inconsistent player with average work ethic.",Arsenal,Yes,jeprjyn,t1_jepnk3l
"This guy has some of the worst defensive stats of any winger in Europe and they all want him at arsenal. Smh my head...

I'm so glad we have a fantastic recruitment team who don't just look at tiktok clips.",Arsenal,Yes,jepqqbs,t1_jepnk3l
Leao‚Äôs technique overall is night and day to pepe,Arsenal,Yes,jeq3kcv,t1_jepnk3l
"It's Pep, they spent like that before Pep and wasn't this much of a consistent robot.",Arsenal,Yes,jen1p5z,t1_jen0uxm
Yea for sure thats's what I meant,Arsenal,Yes,jeqq9zj,t1_jeqq1ah
"Oh yea.

Figure updated to ¬£25m",Arsenal,Yes,jeohon3,t1_jeoeutm
"Haha apologies my man, just noticed he regularly comments on all 3 subs",Arsenal,Yes,jenfgyc,t1_jenfcol
Deputise him.,Arsenal,Yes,jenfu13,t1_jenfcol
We acknowledge him as a clueless yank.  Upvoted by this American.,Arsenal,Yes,jeprgko,t1_jepr8dp
I'm sure Potter doesn't mind. He's a man who values xBag more than the actual bag and he's probably content since his representatives gave their all :),Arsenal,Yes,jerawsx,t1_jeqxcrj
Even so,Arsenal,Yes,jer6f63,t1_jeqxcrj
"Vitor Roque linked by a reliable journalist, these striker links will keep coming. 

Nothing to do with Jesus, the links are more of an indictment on Balogun/Nketiah",Arsenal,Yes,jepbzmz,t1_jepa8ep
"We keep being linked to a striker. Credible ones too, from Tammy Abraham to Vlahovic to Hojlund, it seems we are looking for a technical target man. I think Jesus was going to be Striker B to Striker A or rather the other way round and RW cover. I think Eddie and Balo might be moved on",Arsenal,Yes,jepokdn,t1_jepa8ep
He said he wants to wait until the summer. Let‚Äôs see if that‚Äôs still true,Arsenal,Yes,jephw3o,t1_jepgyei
hope he doesnt do a number on us,Arsenal,Yes,jeph4xl,t1_jepgyei
"Upon rechecking their historical results, you‚Äôre absolutely spot on, warra nonsense results checking from me, fair play. Hopefully this means they carry on dropping points.",Arsenal,Yes,jeovu3s,t1_jeouzbl
"Wish people would stop saying this, it's simply not true 

They're not as good as their best teams but they're well within title winning form from previous seasons 

We could get 91 points and lose to them",Arsenal,Yes,jen8wwl,t1_jen41tg
They looked like that team again yesterday though,Arsenal,Yes,jen5eno,t1_jen41tg
True op is overanalyzing but city still are formidable challengers,Arsenal,Yes,jen3vzp,t1_jen3rtu
We lose a lot of press resistance when Partey does not play.,Arsenal,Yes,jenjiov,t1_jenim8j
"On a side note, partey and white's health are so so important in our run in considering we dont have great alternatives. And odegaard and gabriel too actually scrap that they are all too important pieces. We have to manage how they prepare during training, their recovery very well in between the weeks and hopefully the illness bug stays away from our camp. Cant have last min absentees on matchdays!",Arsenal,Yes,jenkvsg,t1_jenim8j
Spot on.,Arsenal,Yes,jenla90,t1_jenim8j
Can't help but think if we drew that match we'd be 8 points ahead of City and league would probably be settled.,Arsenal,Yes,jenoe2r,t1_jenjuin
"Seeing as though United will soon be owned by Qatar, I'd rather Newcastle be in CL, IF it means United not making it. United with CL and all that money would be nightmare",Arsenal,Yes,jenzwvf,t1_jenvxkl
lmao,Arsenal,Yes,jeohoq3,t1_jeohb4m
Slander suggests it's untrue,Arsenal,Yes,jeoiho3,t1_jeohb4m
"On paper yes. But they are really unbalanced. Right now they have 3 players with the same profile - Havertz, Mount and Felix. I knew immediately that if they go with Havertz and Auba as strikers into the season that they won‚Äòt finish in TOP4.",Arsenal,Yes,jep5o4t,t1_jep52c8
They have a big squad peppered with real quality but what is their average? Where is the consistency across the 11? How do you build a balanced 11 with the profiles they have?,Arsenal,Yes,jep79im,t1_jep52c8
"I think thats intentional too. They wanna push traffic to the foryou page so they can push ads/force you to see stuff they wanna see. 

Elon basically ruining twitter tryna bridge the gap between TikTok and that. Also trying too hard to monetise it and losing the essence of the app.",Arsenal,Yes,jeno5ii,t1_jennt2z
I'll look into it. Thanks,Arsenal,Yes,jeofxak,t1_jenwhff
A little part of me thinks maybe we should have Trossard on the LW to tire out TAA and then bring Martinelli on to run at tired defenders,Arsenal,Yes,jenroqg,t1_jenreb3
After buying him out of Brighton for 20m. Clown behaviour all round,Arsenal,Yes,jep193v,t1_jep0u33
"defo, i‚Äôm liking bennacer too",Arsenal,Yes,jep8wno,t1_jep8se5
"We literally gave Saka a break yesterday.

Arteta said Trossard could play all three forward positions, and here we are.",Arsenal,Yes,jenfjwk,t1_jenf3to
"Just feel that down the line, it's Xhaka's place up for grabs and the way the squad is shaping up, ESR may find himself a bit surplus to requirements. Something to keep an eye in the summer.",Arsenal,Yes,jenmbrn,t1_jenlr38
I wouldn‚Äôt mind him sticking around to get Rice get some of that football intelligence skills training,Arsenal,Yes,jen5kac,t1_jen58j6
Nah there was i rmbr after the villa game i think people would say partey might have to fight for his place on first team,Arsenal,Yes,jenoyi2,t1_jen6rzn
"> ...but I don't think anybody considers him anything more than a stop-gap.

There were idiots claiming he'd bench Thomas lol",Arsenal,Yes,jenffuw,t1_jen6rzn
Haha that would be amazing,Arsenal,Yes,jeonxdm,t1_jeont1k
"Lol, it's a tough question because of the dislike of both teams.",Arsenal,Yes,jeonvm4,t1_jeon2m4
Yes,Arsenal,Yes,jeonis2,t1_jeon2m4
"Not a fake fan, just a fan that doesn't have a good grasp of the present situations of these clubs.",Arsenal,Yes,jeoo0n5,t1_jeon2m4
"Sure but Spuds isn‚Äôt really a threat so might as well fill a CL spot with a non competitive team. 

Plus, who wouldn‚Äôt love to see Utd only make Europa league, get desperate and try to sign players with over inflated contracts. But to make themselves financially solvent they‚Äôll have to get rid of players already on over inflated wages, which will be a tough task on its own. 
Almost a Chelsea 2.0 situation if you will.",Arsenal,Yes,jeoojtl,t1_jeon919
"That's an interest way to look at it. They do get a lot of other revenue, also depends on the new manager?",Arsenal,Yes,jeonsdv,t1_jeon919
Still a bigger chance of winning PL than whoever goes to Topspur I guess,Arsenal,Yes,jep2m1o,t1_jep2du8
"¬£40m payoff?

The man's just going to sit on a beach and drink *all* the rum",Arsenal,Yes,jep2tva,t1_jep2du8
"They have a great squad, what are you even on",Arsenal,Yes,jep59j7,t1_jep3dnt
no that‚Äôs Trent,Arsenal,Yes,jeru8wf,t1_jerbn91
No he is a lifelong Arsenal supporter. I don't think we need him but he has been very vocal about his arsenal support growing up.,Arsenal,Yes,jennoz5,t1_jenm9ck
"Yeah I'd love him, but would take a huge transfer fee for him to leave",Arsenal,Yes,jeoknzx,t1_jeokcu9
Wouldn‚Äôt he play 6?,Arsenal,Yes,jeon2al,t1_jeokcu9
Trossard scored a hat-trick at the Field. Might put too much pressure on Jesus but I get what you mean.,Arsenal,Yes,jer80mh,t1_jer7piw
"Everyone will *want* to beat us, but if *that* Liverpool or *that* Chelsea turn up against us, they won't stand a chance.",Arsenal,Yes,jen3861,t1_jen2p6y
Hope no one falls for this shit and the club remains in mid table where they belong,Arsenal,Yes,jeoj27g,t1_jeoighx
"Damn. Hopefully he continues his poor run of form for a long time. Unless of course, we somehow buy him. But we already have Fabio Viera, similar but Mount is right footed. So..we shall see",Arsenal,Yes,jeoiy0b,t1_jeoieaj
"Brighton deserve it, but once again their finishing just hasn't been good enough.",Arsenal,Yes,jeov7j5,t1_jeouyc2
"No way. Spurs all day because they'll fuck it up. I would like United to be as cucked as possible, thanks.",Arsenal,Yes,jeov939,t1_jeouhw4
"Signing the german potter, oh shiver me timbers.",Arsenal,Yes,jep9e2g,t1_jep99qr
Oh wait until they meet Ivan Toney & the gang,Arsenal,Yes,jepqlps,t1_jepp3wq
[deleted],Arsenal,Yes,jen1p7w,t1_jen135t
8 goals in the Prem for the price he commanded. Mane had 16 league goals in his ‚Äúdrop off‚Äù season before he left,Arsenal,Yes,jen27ii,t1_jen135t

I think Nunez will be a a good player in a good team. But he's not gonna carry you or do it by himself.,Arsenal,Yes,jen0i5i,t1_jen02du
"Felix absolutely deserves to be among those names and he's not better than Darwin or Gakpo. Fancy touches tricking people again, he's another useless footballer like Havertz.",Arsenal,Yes,jen5hd6,t1_jen2jrg
Nunez would have headbutted him lol,Arsenal,Yes,jenqyqb,t1_jenqbpy
oops! edited lol,Arsenal,Yes,jenrigz,t1_jenqbpy
[deleted],Arsenal,Yes,jenqeqt,t1_jenpqgm
Utterly useless to the point Arsenal bid 60m+ pounds on him üòê Give your head a wobble.,Arsenal,Yes,jeo3b26,t1_jeo2kq6
Arteta is better than Klopp. With Pep i'd be more hesitant to say but this season absolutely Arteta has been more impressivel.,Arsenal,Yes,jeowwek,t1_jeovw5c
You aren‚Äôt delusional. He‚Äôs not good enough for us.,Arsenal,Yes,jengnu3,t1_jenggoz
I think that you and I are agreeing,Arsenal,Yes,jenifu5,t1_jenggoz
I think it's needed in midfield. Especially in the prem you need to be able to control the game in different ways because different teams throw different things at you. You need the technical ability to stay in that fight Vs City. And you need the physicality to stay in that fight Vs Newcastle or Palace or someone like that.,Arsenal,Yes,jeo5uj5,t1_jeo51m7
"Not to mention the shambles that was Arsenal 19/20 managed to beat them too, one of our funnest games",Arsenal,Yes,jeptmuq,t1_jep9ovz
">But what motivation does Napoli have to play well in this game?

Winning the league, possibly.",Arsenal,Yes,jepltyw,t1_jep9swj
"Serie A has changed, a lot. It‚Äôs a much more exciting league these days, even if it seems like maybe the quality has dipped a bit. I like that there‚Äôs some room for teams to compete for silverware in a way that just doesn‚Äôt exist in Germany, France, or Spain. The Premier League is still I think the most even of the top five leagues, and the quality is the best, and I love it by far the most, but Serie A is a lot of fun now",Arsenal,Yes,jer6rku,t1_jer67g9
"This team has shown that they can overcome mental blocks. Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Selhurst Park and Amex are all 3 stadiums which we did poorly for and we won at all of them.",Arsenal,Yes,jenacl2,t1_jena9rx
Disagree. Tottenham could have came back in the second half if Ramsdale didn't have a good day.,Arsenal,Yes,jen9ixc,t1_jen96e1
He‚Äôs the slowest CB since Mertesacker he‚Äôs not playing RB for anyone.,Arsenal,Yes,jendh78,t1_jencds1
"He is too weak, not gonna work",Arsenal,Yes,jendjhk,t1_jencds1
You know sometimes you remember something random and it won't go away until you spam the DD?,Arsenal,Yes,jendzzr,t1_jendra2
Boardman gets paid,Arsenal,Yes,jennwr0,t1_jenl00v
To be fair many of rhe times ive lurked they have been fully admitting we're playing genuinely good football. We make it kind of hard to be as delusional as you say they are,Arsenal,Yes,jeo0nnh,t1_jeny8sj
"It's a home game.

We are conceding whether you like it or not.",Arsenal,Yes,jenqzqy,t1_jenks7h
"I could be wrong, but by my calculations, taking 30 points from our final 30 would be advantageous.",Arsenal,Yes,jenkjtx,t1_jenjzah
"95 secures the title, whether we get that early or on the last day.",Arsenal,Yes,jenqqw7,t1_jenjzah
Elliott is overhated. Kids 19 he'll come good.,Arsenal,Yes,jengm1r,t1_jenfyvy
"Truly. At r/coys and r/chelsea they're all calling for a project manager but they don't seem to understand that sometimes you have to be shit to become better. I'm glad we came through it. Hopefully we'll only get better! Whether we win the league or not, this season has already been a huge success. It has got me watching Arsenal again and i can say the same for many fans.",Arsenal,Yes,jen22qh,t1_jen1cz8
"Yeah that was about as close as I got too, I would have still been sad it didn't work out but at a couple points the hope was burning very low.",Arsenal,Yes,jen3p0q,t1_jen1cz8
The funny thing to me is the portion of fans here that try to brag as much as possible about the fact that they supported Arteta from day 1 until here are often the same people that call for Holding‚Äôs head anytime he is forced to start a game,Arsenal,Yes,jen20xt,t1_jen1e70
"How were those games? I watched the Chelsea game yesterday. They were pretty dominant, but Villa took their chances and Chelsea missed a few sitters. Was it the same during the torrid run? Were the other teams just lucky? And were unlucky?",Arsenal,Yes,jen1tz8,t1_jen1e70
"That‚Äôs just not true lmao; if anything, it was 70/30 in favor of Arteta Out. We were playing terribly & our offensive tactics solely consisted of spamming crosses & hoping for the best",Arsenal,Yes,jena9yf,t1_jen1e70
"Wow. Thank you so much for typing all this out. 

I‚Äôm glad I decided to put my mental health first and stopped watching football for a while. I don‚Äôt think I would have made it out of that patch. 

Great job by the board to trust Arteta when it would have been easier to sack him. I feel he‚Äôd show the same respect to the club when bigger clubs come calling eventually. 

I‚Äôm just gonna bask in our glory and revel in rival fans‚Äô misery. Wish United were still shit.",Arsenal,Yes,jen40c9,t1_jen3k7b
Match threads are the worst place. Even today you'd find people not happy with Arteta. Yesterday a guy wanted Jesus sold in the summer.,Arsenal,Yes,jen2y3o,t1_jen2jnx
The one thing I'd say in his defense is that Chelsea like Brighton under Potter (he didn't really get the full benefit of Ferguson) don't have a real striker. Not convinced he's set them up optimally though.,Arsenal,Yes,jeng3gd,t1_jene36k
There's still more than enough finishing quality in that squad to do better with the chances they're making.,Arsenal,Yes,jeni5qw,t1_jene36k
"I think any manager would struggle with a 30 man squad, majoring of whom has joined this season",Arsenal,Yes,jenecin,t1_jendy4d
Klopp delivered in his 1st full season and had an abject squad. Awful comparison.,Arsenal,Yes,jeneex8,t1_jendz0m
Irrelevant to the conversation being had,Arsenal,Yes,jeniqz0,t1_jeninmn
"Why would he have to be a regular starter for them to be useful here? I never said he should start here.
 

We could blatantly buy Odegaard regardless of Willock. If you think we had to sell to buy I have a bridge to sell you. A nice rainbow coloured one with a pot of gold at the bottom.",Arsenal,Yes,jenid9n,t1_jenhu91
No timing like God's timing ü´°,Arsenal,Yes,jeohny5,t1_jeogwdy
"I see this argument all the time and I really don't get it. Have Chelsea been boosted by having Pulisic?

American have been exposed to football for decades now. I feel like most of the people that have some interest have a club already.

And this ethatvarent interested are probably already invested in NFL/NBA/MLB or Hockey etc",Arsenal,Yes,jeo5d88,t1_jeo42vk
Trossard has been the most in form forward in the last 4-5 games,Arsenal,Yes,jen1zvj,t1_jen1xi4
Loooool Jesus on the bench vs Poolü§£,Arsenal,Yes,jen1bsz,t1_jen11d5
hilarious.,Arsenal,Yes,jen1ak9,t1_jen11d5
Un(fortunately) I‚Äôve only been post World Cup.,Arsenal,Yes,jen7dy7,t1_jen735g
It's fine we'll just wear the white kit and they'll shit themselves thinking Real Madrid have come back for more,Arsenal,Yes,jenzg0w,t1_jenvh5i
I wouldn't be pragmatic actually. They have huge fixture congestion. We will be well rested in comparison.,Arsenal,Yes,jeo9t5e,t1_jeo8g9v
I take it back that attack was crazy,Arsenal,Yes,jeoafp4,t1_jeoa8qg
"No if that happens they give a CL spot to the next country down.

You only get five spots if the team getting cl quali *don't* qualify through the league",Arsenal,Yes,jeozkc5,t1_jeoyb4e
"Not really. Only the top 4 gets UCL AND if someone outside the top 4 wins UEL (or UCL for that matter) they get to play UCL. The 5th place isn't going to get UCL just because someone in the top 4 won the UEL. The 5th place is guaranteed (mostly) UEL next season assuming they didn't win UCL or UEL in the season where they finished 5th.

On the outside chance that two clubs outside the top 4 wins the UCL AND UEL, then the fourth drops to Europa League, because a maximum of five teams from a country can play in CL.",Arsenal,Yes,jeozgcb,t1_jeoyb4e
that would be news to me,Arsenal,Yes,jeoyfxe,t1_jeoyb4e
"Yeah I know. That's why I said ""could"".",Arsenal,Yes,jen73nn,t1_jen6yam
"Using that logic, I guess you don't rate Arteta and Edu's talent evaluation?",Arsenal,Yes,jen7yv4,t1_jen7iaa
"Barcelona lost to United after dropping out of the CL in the group stage, I really don't rate them.",Arsenal,Yes,jepc6hi,t1_jepbpth
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs his game management that is the issues. How many times did we try defending 1-0 or 2-0 leads only to draw the game because we completely shut down,Arsenal,Yes,jen0n08,t1_jen05g2
"Chelsea aren't a dead end for young player development. Mount James etc

Yeah you would have to make a lot of assumptions.

But I'd also not have paid over ¬£60m for him",Arsenal,Yes,jen6gj5,t1_jen60zt
"to united fans, every players above 24 years old that start the game frequently is world class, while anyone under 23 is wonderkid.",Arsenal,Yes,jer8poy,t1_jeq1n6w
Hmm,Arsenal,Yes,jepslr9,t1_jepsjr8
"Like *yes* but pioli has been playing him a second striker with giroud in a 3-5-2 for most of 2023 and he has been completely ineffective, he finally broke what iirc was an 11 game goal drought today playing LW. Also you‚Äôre right in that his defensive work rate is a huge issue",Arsenal,Yes,jeq8x8p,t1_jepsjr8
lol that‚Äôs why i asked,Arsenal,Yes,jenvuph,t1_jenue6h
Anyone but United,Arsenal,Yes,jesasx8,t1_jes1otq
Murdryk shouldnt be written off just because he plays for chelsea. The man clearly has huge potential,Arsenal,Yes,jeodqbg,t1_jeo9oo9
"Yeah i would agree that we‚Äôre/im definitely spoiled in that our minimum expectations are european football but i also remember getting bantered by villa not too long ago.

Suppose it is always important to remember there are those worse off than you but there are also some better off haha!",Arsenal,Yes,jentp9e,t1_jentc2d
where would he play?,Arsenal,Yes,jepvpyx,t1_jepqnb8
How bout him and tielemans,Arsenal,Yes,jeq7czx,t1_jeq61cb
"Worst idea I've seen on here in a bit, well done.",Arsenal,Yes,jepsjt5,t1_jepr9er
"JWP is mid. He ain't it. He's just a good dead ball specialist, that's it.",Arsenal,Yes,jeptysq,t1_jepr9er
No shot. There is a reason JWP is at Southampton not a Villa.,Arsenal,Yes,jepthg6,t1_jepr9er
"Respect your opinion, but completely disagree. He‚Äôs a CDM so its not surprising his assists are low. He‚Äôs Fulham‚Äôs best player bar maybe Mitrovic and leads the league in tackles. I think he‚Äôd do wonders for us.",Arsenal,Yes,jeojqc6,t1_jeohiyg
I don't think it comes down to that game. A win guarantees but I still think City will drop points elsewhere as well.,Arsenal,Yes,jen1f5x,t1_jen0wyc
"One of Brighton, Fulham, or Brentford I think. All tricky away fixtures and City's away form is meh. I think we get a point at the Etihad as well.",Arsenal,Yes,jen0kvj,t1_jen0h4y
I hope you're joking.,Arsenal,Yes,jeopkx4,t1_jeopdp3
Varane is rubbish,Arsenal,Yes,jeoppyb,t1_jeop8yl
Talent isn't just how good you are on the ball. Joelinton's physical profile and ball retention is far more unique than Fernandes. You can find players like Fernandes anywhere. Joelinton is a special profile like SMS.,Arsenal,Yes,jeoq35v,t1_jeopnmv
"United play a deep block every game and concede 3 or 4 goals every few games. This wouldn't happen if they had good defenders. Schar is no worldbeater but come on, we are comparing him to Varane.",Arsenal,Yes,jeoptaj,t1_jeopnby
Lavia is class,Arsenal,Yes,jeo2xm9,t1_jeo2sd2
Still rattled I seeüòÇüòÇüòÇ,Arsenal,Yes,jeoafw5,t1_jeo5olz

His shot stopping has been great this season tbf.,Arsenal,Yes,jen62qf,t1_jen5ga4
"Were you watching the match yesterday?

He was apologising for his crap distribution and made several one on one snap saves being beaten only by a horrendous deflection",Arsenal,Yes,jen90ik,t1_jen5ga4

">Moyes and Rodgers will...stop getting calls and end up having to drop down to the Championship.

Agree about Moyes, but don't know how Rodgers has ended up here.

Just won the FA cup a few years ago, almost got Leicester top four that season too. I know after the Liverpool stint and that documentary, he kind of became this David Brent figure. But he's salvaged his reputation since then. He's a football obsessive just like Pep and Arteta, and if anyone could keep up with new trends and ideas, thought he would.

Don't understand what's gone wrong there.",Arsenal,Yes,jen1y9v,t1_jen0h4o
"Plus, City will need to play them too so all square",Arsenal,Yes,jeqmb8o,t1_jeqkysd
You mean you wouldn‚Äôt right,Arsenal,Yes,jeq9arc,t1_jeq9848
"he literally paused time and threaded the needle and we have dopamine starved fans making these posts

Understat has Gabi ahead of Saka even.,Arsenal,Yes,jeqf34i,t1_jeqe52o

It's just been his turn on the physio bed. Saka Martinelli and Trossard now have all been fit and in form all season. Any of that changes and he's next man up. Also UCL will stretch the squad further than we were stretched this year.,Arsenal,Yes,jenocy2,t1_jenmbrn

He literally gave an interview where he said he grew up supporting Chelski and going to their games with his old man.

They have a couple of players who they will absolutely make a fortune on: Caicedo, Estupian, March, Macallister and Mitoma. I do not seeing them staying past next season but whatever the case, Brighton will eat good with that bunch. With proper reinvestment, they look like they'll be up in the league for a long time and not just as a selling club. They have shown a commitment to good football, they are good to watch, strong manager who I think understands that they buy low and sell high but is still committed to the project it seems. They are in a really good place.",Arsenal,Yes,jen0ar8,t1_jemzp0j
Nope. Caicedo is worth it. He's in a possession based team and has certain qualities that we want even out of possession.,Arsenal,Yes,jen190t,t1_jemzp0j
I would say that we buy good players that fit our style of play not just player with potential. I think it is the advantage when you have manager with philosophy,Arsenal,Yes,jen0e2w,t1_jemzvyt

I like Arteta more but Klopp built an all-time team. Use our noodles.",Arsenal,Yes,jeoxkck,t1_jeowwek

It wasn‚Äôt pretty for some portions but that was typical Arteta game management. We were always gonna win that. Also now we have Jesus back which adds an extra element of unpredictability to our approach.,Arsenal,Yes,jeni49e,t1_jen9ixc
"If you‚Äôve watched him play you know he‚Äôs a similar style of player to White. Not as good but very similar prototype. Has me thinking that if (big if) there‚Äôs legitimate interest, it‚Äôs to compete with Bennie.",Arsenal,Yes,jene21j,t1_jendh78

"Some fans just don't make sense. Do they really expect a Vincent Kompany-esc player as our 4th choice center back?  Holding does a decent job most times. Shouldn't fans be supportive of the players on the field? Sure, they might not be the best, but it's what we got. Surely giving out positive vibes is not going to harm you and MIGHT actually help the player who is not doing great.

No we were god awful.,Arsenal,Yes,jen2jja,t1_jen1tz8
"It was annoying because we could've gotten a result in some games but there's games where we get outplayed outright but I put that on the player not being up to par.

What made me stick with Arteta was the team still being positive about him, not much you as a fan can do when they all sing praises for him even during the terrible run.

I also don't really know what Chelsea tactics is, during our bad run last season we could still see the shape.",Arsenal,Yes,jen23yu,t1_jen1tz8
"You witnessed how shite Man United was last season under Ole/Rangnick with the incredible defence of Maguire/Lindelof/Telles?

"Well I'll be damned, at least that's what I saw during discussion. I also avoid post match thread after a loss or match thread cause that's where all the low iq hot takes will come out.

It was a lot of crossing but there's build up to even get the ball there which is why I mentioned the shape. Sure as hell can't expect KT to do what Zinchenko does this season and Laca to do what Jesus did.",Arsenal,Yes,jendn3s,t1_jena9yf
Trolls from other clubs posing as an arsenal supporter just to stir shit up and provoke people I assume... what idiot can even refute artetas impact at this point.,Arsenal,Yes,jen3b5v,t1_jen2y3o

Just tell me who would u drop? Viera Xhaka ESR or Ode?,Arsenal,Yes,jenkvfc,t1_jeniqz0
"I'm Canadian, so I don't know 100%, but its a similar sporting culture here as in the States. I think it really depends on how much Balogun is ""branded"" (as much as I personally hate that notion). Pulisic has, anecdotally, made a lot of people interested in football solely because he's been branded as ""the LeBron James of soccer,"" regardless of how much of a joke that is. Americans love to feel like they have some special claim to the game, and new fans largely won't get interested in football unless they think something special is happening. So if the American hype over Balogun keeps increasing on the trajectory it is now, I can see the commercial benefits clearly. It's like with Davies and David here in Canada. Even before our WC qualification, interest was increasing (and it was a LOT harder to get tickets for national games) solely because we had superstars, and could watch big European matches while feeling like we had some personal stake in it. When Bayern won the CL in 2020 with Davies, thats the only time I've seen football news on Canadian television (outside of niche programs).",Arsenal,Yes,jeo6l5u,t1_jeo5d88

"Barca were in a gigantic injury crisis during the CL group stage. More bad injuries during their EL loss. They were without their 2 starting midfielders and Dembele in the second leg. Take Partey, Martinelli and Odegaard out for us and we would also struggle.

"Big concerns about the defensive work rate though. He would have to completely revolutionise this part of his game to play for us. No doubt about his attacking quality though. LW or CF, Leao would be a devastating forward",Arsenal,Yes,jepu6dl,t1_jepslr9
"(Rest of the team has been shit too in 2023 milan actually showed up today so it may be an issue of system for him rather than an inability to play ST, but after the game in an interview they asked him directly what he preferred and he said the wing)",Arsenal,Yes,jeq93fc,t1_jeq8x8p
"A friend took me to see Plymouth Argyle play - his whole family have season tickets (including his grandmother) and as many of them go every week as possible.

It's his passes attempted, completed, received. A CDM should be very high in all of these. He is near the bottom of all midfielders in Europe.

His metrics are very similar to Mctominay, but just worse in every single area except for goals scored.

It's funny because this might be the worst A1 take of the week, or it might not be top 10. It's so hard to keep track.

Joelinton is good at running. He gets 2 goals a season. You can find that anywhere.

Fernandes had a season with 30 league goal contributions. We've had *one* player manage that once in the last decade.

"I get what you are saying, but martinelli hasn't been taking on his man all that much since the wc. And our wingers constantly switch positions anyways, so I think he could perfectly start at lw. Right now you just can't drop martinelli, but when he drops form I would go trossard and vice versa.",Arsenal,Yes,jeo0fwe,t1_jens15x
Trossard for me is hugely versatile. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs in our best XI but for me he‚Äôs the first backup to FIVE different positions.,Arsenal,Yes,jeoe37n,t1_jens15x
There were arguments at City that Jesus best position was RW,Arsenal,Yes,jenhuif,t1_jengh5q
"I think it was a combination of factors tbh.
Odegaard wasn't good in the first half either, white was sitting back covering for holding and obviously 1 game is not enough to build up chemistry.
I'm pretty sure they didn't even train for this. Second half it was much better. I think it's worth revisiting if saka needs a break.",Arsenal,Yes,jeniiz9,t1_jengh5q

"Maybe it‚Äôs the masochist in me, but I prefer a spicy NLD and the rivalry that comes with it than the other London derbies with their respective clubs. 

Ever since the Glazer‚Äôs takeover over of Utd. and Ronaldo‚Äôs arrival at the club around the same time, it became like the poster boy club for the PL  in the US even though we were having our best season to date. 
I guess the excessive hype of Utd. was a bit to much for me  and left a sour taste in the mouth.",Arsenal,Yes,jeorj0d,t1_jeop1a5

Xhaka is the obvious answer.,Arsenal,Yes,jenmb07,t1_jenkvfc

‚ÄúHarder to deal with Trent‚Äù haha Trent has been getting cooked by everyone. I just want him to start. His creativity would help the most,Arsenal,Yes,jen31m8,t1_jen2env

"Yup. Also get five if Chelsea come 10th and win the CL God forbid.

I think there's a limit of five though so theoretically they could both do that and spurs could come fourth and not get CL",Arsenal,Yes,jep08y0,t1_jeozy5k
"True.

That's a different argument to saying they're bad for youth development and I'd agree with this argument. They've wasted so much cash buying players and waiting for them to adjust because they're impatient with their own academy products.",Arsenal,Yes,jen6pez,t1_jen6idr
Does the upside outweigh the downside? The way we play our defensive duties are increasingly less with each game,Arsenal,Yes,jeputal,t1_jepu6dl

"He is a good player but Joelinton is as well, just for different reasons.",Arsenal,Yes,jeot4v7,t1_jeopzp1
The people that constantly bring up his stats must not watch him play. I don't see how you think it's impressive that he gets those stats when he constantly makes the riskiest passes. It will come off once but waste possession 10 times beforehand.,Arsenal,Yes,jeor9j6,t1_jeoqqst

Shame man not a fan of state owned clubs. Just hope they either go back and decide to keep them lol or Ratcliffe somehow wins or something,Arsenal,Yes,jeo3il9,t1_jeo2h3w

"He averages less dribbles than each of those players by a significant amount. No one said he can‚Äôt take players on, he‚Äôs just worse at it than Saka and Martinelli.",Arsenal,Yes,jenty0m,t1_jentcf2
There's no way you think Trossard is as athletic/explosive as Saka??????,Arsenal,Yes,jeny6yb,t1_jentcf2
"Wonder how you rate grealish/mahrez, not really the most dynamic wingers out there either?",Arsenal,Yes,jeo1fbg,t1_jenxt4y
"just seems to be suboptimal to remove our 9 from the 9, but yeah, he's good enough to play there if needed. a proper right winger just makes sense, specially with champions league coming up",Arsenal,Yes,jenj7kc,t1_jenhuif
"a more like for like replacement suits the right side dynamics more imo. trossard/ jesus there is good and it works in the sense of giving our current options enough minutes, but a left footed winger would be a great addition",Arsenal,Yes,jenjl7f,t1_jeniiz9
"They have *one* good mf under 28 and zero good goal scorers, period.",Arsenal,Yes,jep6avf,t1_jep65zq
"Don‚Äôt think so really. 

They have one true winger who‚Äôs not taken to league well, 3 or 4 ss / 10 types all of whom like playing off of a proper cf that doesn‚Äôt exist in their squad, no dm etc.

Also They don‚Äôt have new owners yet and I reckon it is becoming increasingly likely the Glazers stay and don‚Äôt sell (or sell minority stake). 

As a Londoner the scum will always be bigger rivals than United. The rivalry between United just isn‚Äôt what it was in the Wenger Fergie days. Yeah their online fans are annoying but who gives a shit about their dumb fans. 

No UCL for Spurs means they are even more fucked than they already are, and no UCL revenue for Daniel Levy and his business organisation. United will always be uber rich. It won‚Äôt make that much of a difference if they get UCL or not I‚Äôm afraid.",Arsenal,Yes,jeowr1c,t1_jeovz06

"My point is simply that just because we're interested doesn't make him a good player.

He's thoroughly out of his depth, and I'm so glad Shakhtar refused our bid. Trossard was a fantastic pick up instead.",Arsenal,Yes,jeo529d,t1_jeo4qel
"When we brought in Willian, Saka wasn't ready yet and Martinelli was recovering from knee surgery.

"It definitely isn't yet.

We could drop points in a bunch of remaining games.

We haven't won anything yet.

Klopp has won the CL and PL.",Arsenal,Yes,jeoyg4h,t1_jeoxvrb
Yeah see what u saying but like the way I see it is like he built a team that achieved 99 and 97 points in a PL season and got them to 3 UCL finals in the space of 7 years. Argueably should've won a bit more given performance of his teams but being toe to toe with the likes of City numerous times is a big achievement. I think this team Arteta has built in 3 years is kinda close to the level Klopp achieved but I think it's still to early to judge. Probs gonna be end of next season at earliest for me to determine which is better I think,Arsenal,Yes,jeozhw8,t1_jeoxrbw
"Yep, gonna be end of next season at least I think before we can judge. Gonna be interesting to see how we get on next season with UCL football thrown in the mix. Gonna be exciting for sure",Arsenal,Yes,jeoznwl,t1_jeoykun
"Well it's tough in those kind of situations or the American sports before the playoffs.

"Like I said, a lot of assumptions would be have to be made for this specific 'what if' scenario. It's very hard to tell definitively, but I also understand why you can't help but wonder ""what if?""

There is a player there waiting to be developed into something truly great. Even a cursory glance makes it obvious.",Arsenal,Yes,jen6srk,t1_jen6pez
That‚Äôs not quite accurate really. To play for Arteta you have to work hard off the ball,Arsenal,Yes,jepvb5p,t1_jeputal
Could get away with it with a different team.,Arsenal,Yes,jeq3yrk,t1_jeputal
"I genuinely don't care how risky passes are if you're at 30 goals/assists in the league. It's the same reason Pep doesn't care that Haaland isn't involved in the build up. You work around world class numbers.

Again, that's how Alexis had perhaps the best season of the Emirates era.

The problem is when the output is lessened for either player and its at ~15 goal contributions.",Arsenal,Yes,jeork8t,t1_jeor9j6
"I didn‚Äôt specifically mention shot stopping though. Coming for corners / crosses he‚Äôs been shakey this season for example. Ramsdale has improved a lot though, Spurs away for example was a top performance, but I still think there‚Äôs a lot of development before we compare him with the likes of Alisson",Arsenal,Yes,jena0a3,t1_jen9mb0

"Nah, that would be Spurs",Arsenal,Yes,jeojek8,t1_jeoj35n
"Sure, but that's a pretty fucking high bar, lol

I still don't agree with your point that just because he isn't as good of a dribbler as those two, he can't play as a winger in our system",Arsenal,Yes,jenuarn,t1_jenty0m
">athletic/explosive

Those are two different things.

I absoluteley think that Saka is more athletic, he's taller and much stronger. However when it comes to speed I think Saka's not miles ahead of Trossard.",Arsenal,Yes,jenzrde,t1_jeny6yb
Not that high tbh. I think Grealish might be a better LCM. Mahrez is just too streaky for me in terms of form.,Arsenal,Yes,jeo1pp1,t1_jeo1fbg
If we're rotating its a good chance to give someone else a go.,Arsenal,Yes,jenjhri,t1_jenj7kc
"I mean if we can get a good left footer for reasonable money, absolutely. I'd just rather see us get 2 marquee midfielder signings than to splash out 50 mil+ for a rw who might not play a lot. We do have cozier dubarry and marquinhos, but they are probably not  ready to make the jump next season.",Arsenal,Yes,jenkrpb,t1_jenjl7f
"The funny thing is, a lot of it could be fixed with players thay have sold.

Tammy Abraham would help quite a bit.",Arsenal,Yes,jep9n0x,t1_jep7rzy
No...I was thinking of Buendia who went to Villa around the time we signed Odegaard permanently,Arsenal,Yes,jeondnl,t1_jeolobu
"Anything to take the sheen off the apple for me. Spurs are selling Kane either way and investing it poorly. They suck anyway and I must say that it would be so sweet to have folks spending a month talking about their title challenge and then not making the UCL.

Yeah hate spurs but letting Chelsea and Man U win major trophies just to stop them getting CL is too much,Arsenal,Yes,jep45mj,t1_jep139v
Alexis did not have the best season of the Emirates era. I don't understand this obsession with stats. It is common acknowledgement that RVP and Fabregas had better seasons. They were  2 footballers a level above Sanchez.,Arsenal,Yes,jeorwm6,t1_jeork8t
"He's not been bad on crosses either, really not sure where this is coming from.

"Absolutely it‚Äôs a high bar. It‚Äôs 4 amazing players for 3 spots. 

Someone is going to be unfairly left out in the XI. To me it‚Äôs Trossard but I get others might not feel that way considering the form he‚Äôs on.",Arsenal,Yes,jenvbs7,t1_jenuarn
Saka has a much better burst for beating players with the ball or making runs in behind.,Arsenal,Yes,jeo06x9,t1_jenzrde
It's all a part of the package when it comes to beating your man 1v1. If you're fast and weak you just get knocked off it. Sakas far superior strength allows his to complete more 1v1 dribbles.,Arsenal,Yes,jeo0bmh,t1_jenzrde
marquinhos being ready for a role would be huge,Arsenal,Yes,jenmot0,t1_jenkrpb
"Yeh but I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs the level required anyway so it‚Äôs slightly moot i think.

"True mate would be bare funny tho. I actually have quite a bit more respect for them as a club in general than Chelsea, United and City.

"Alexis had the most non penalty goal contributions and highest expected goals/assists in a season in the Emirates era.

You can debate the 08 and 10 cesc/rvp seasons vs that, but its not common *knowledge* (common acknowledgement is not a phrase).",Arsenal,Yes,jeos8s4,t1_jeorwm6
"He‚Äôs bad on set pieces. United home and PSV away. Also all over the place for the offside goal against Brentford. There are plenty of examples.

"we literally don‚Äôt know what these two dudes were saying yesterday , let‚Äôs focus on that first . just blanket blaming doesn‚Äôt seem constructive to me but u do u",Arsenal,Yes,jendqnl,t1_jendlp9
"The point I‚Äôm making is that you keep saying that you ‚Äúchose your words poorly‚Äù. 

That suggests that you could have worded your original comment in a way which would make sense of your reference to the working class, but you still haven‚Äôt given any valid alternative construction of that sentence. As it (still) is, the only possible interpretation of the reference to the working class is to read it as being suggestive that racism is more prevalent in that class.

Leaving it up is all well and good, but only if you are able to show that you were actually misconstrued. So far, you haven‚Äôt provided any alternative interpretation of your original comment, so there is still only one possible way to interpret it. Leaving it up does nothing more than continuing to suggest that racism is more prevalent in the working class.

Edit: I should also say that I am actually interested in hearing your alternative interpretation, if you have one. I‚Äôm actually trying to help and am intellectually curious about this, since you seem adamant that you had a good reason for referring to the working class (and that you are just being misinterpreted). I kind of want to know what that reason is.",Arsenal,Yes,jerpzal,t1_jerj5zf
Spurs were closer than us too. If we were 8 points ahead of City right now everyone would feel more comfortable. Being points clear is a better position than chasing.,Arsenal,Yes,jenkiob,t1_jenk8p6

"I sadly think they get decent fees for most. They refused 40m for Gallagher and reportedly pool want him.

"Haha, sure. I'm happy to agree with all these separate points you're making. He's not doing a great job. But the xG thing is probably connected to the strikers he's had (and bought).",Arsenal,Yes,jenhahv,t1_jenh53v

"Really want Liverpool to win, but blimey the fans don't half make it difficult to root for them.

Was having a discussion yesterday about Bellingham-to-Liverpool, when I was told that ""Liverpool don't spend"". I mentioned that they'd literally just dropped ¬£60m on Nunez, as well as high fees on others like Fabinho, Jota, Diaz, Gakpo, Konate and Keita. My mistake, it seems, was mentioning Alisson and Van Dijk as well.

Was instantly met with ""coutinho money, doesn't count"", and it hit me how many times I've read that over the years. Like, that one sale from 5 years ago funds everything they've done? That's amazing! I figured I'd spend some time this morning looking up their incomings and outgoings just to verify these claims, since it seems to get mentioned almost every time a Liverpool transfer rumour comes up.

Well, it certainly adds up that Coutinho = Van Dijk & Alisson, the fees and timing match up nearly perfectly. So maybe it's the ¬£50m they got for Mane and Ings that makes up for the ¬£180m+ they've spent on forwards since 2020? Oh, that must also cover the big wage increases for Salah, Alisson, Van Dijk, Fabinho, Jota, Robertson and Alexander-Arnold in the last couple of years. FA Documents yesterday also revealed they've dropped more on agent fees than the vast majority of the league, by a wide margin (admittedly Chelsea and City have spent even more compared to that). Nah, that was also probably equalled out by the astronomical agent fees Bayern surely paid them last Summer.

They're so desperate to show they're not like the oil clubs, when nobody ever accused them of it. You can spend money without it being a corrupt sugar daddy, look at United. Just don't go widely in the other direction and act like you're some plucky underdog without a penny to your name.

This ""one match at a time""-thing is a cliche by now, but I think it's a very good mindset and it seems to have helped us. Maybe making a good thing a cliche is something that helps. I honestly think some of Arteta's things can seem a little cheesy (e.g that lightbulb speech, the posters with slogans etc), at least from the outside, but his passion and energy (also cliches haha) seem to influence the entire team, including us supporters.

"Doing some thinking about the run in, if we drop points in 3/4 of our big matches (loss to city, draws to Pool and Newcastle and a win v Chelsea or some combo of the above) for a total of 5 points from 12, and pick up max points in others, we could possibly end up with 92 points. That‚Äôs actually a lower PPG (2.2) than we‚Äôve managed so far (2.45).

For city to match that from their remaining 10 matches they need 28 points from a possible 30, meaning they can only drop points once. They‚Äôve got away trips to Brighton and Brentford, who‚Äôve both shown they can take it to the best this year, and Everton for some propah Brexit football. There‚Äôs also always the possibility that they drop points vs Chelsea if they can do a madness. Could see them dropping maybe 5 points with their remaining fixtures, for a total of 89 points.

Now I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs impossible for city to not drop any points at all, but their current PPG is 2.28, and to do so would require them to match our winning streak in 2002, basically accruing max points from their last 10 matches if the season isn‚Äôt gonna go down to goal difference. 

Add in the likely priority of Pep/City to win UCL over the EPL, I actually think we‚Äôve got a decent chance of getting over the line. 

Alternatively, if our points per game holds, we‚Äôll end up on 94 points and city on 87 which would mean it doesn‚Äôt go down to the final day, which would be great for my blood pressure.

"I'm a big fan of the Ticket Exchange as every time you get a ticket you sit in a different seat with different vibes. The downside of this is that you can find yourself in a block with zero atmosphere. Today I experienced this which I think was due to the following:

* It was one block over from the Family Enclosure

* The American family sat next to me spent most of their time playing on their phones and didn't talk to each other, let along sing.

* The family behind me was at their very first Arsenal game and hilariously got lost in the stadium at half time. I think they missed our 2nd and 3rd goals.

* A group of Americans clearly attending their first ever ""soccer"" game. Lovely group to talk to and joined in the singing only in the 2nd half when they worked out what was going on. They spent over $400 each on their tickets from a tout!

* The many tourists in the area wearing their half & half scarves.

I want this rematch.",Arsenal,Yes,jej7dy9,t1_jej74xq
There was a post 50 min ago.,Arsenal,Yes,jejroh0,t1_jejqw8r
They aren't sacking him with 10 games left and nothing to play for. They'll give him till the end of the season no matter how bad it gets because if not then a new manager will walk into a toxic mess.,Arsenal,Yes,jekc38n,t1_jekbkx4
"Seriously do not worry about Chelsea, they are finished",Arsenal,Yes,jekdm2k,t1_jekbkx4
They‚Äôll either sack him today or he‚Äôll see out the season imo,Arsenal,Yes,jekcixo,t1_jekbkx4

"beat City?

my goodness, what an idea!

why didn‚Äôt I think of that?

beat City!",Arsenal,Yes,jelydbz,t1_jels05q
"That's assuming City go unbeaten till the end of the season, which they probably won't.",Arsenal,Yes,jemm516,t1_jels05q
"I've come to accept that we do not have to beat them. We just don't have to lose. It's okay to beat them, I mean, but going to Eithad with the a great thou art attitude is not it.",Arsenal,Yes,jemrrdx,t1_jels05q
Hope you have a great time mate,Arsenal,Yes,jeisue9,t1_jeipqbf
13 points above the relegation zone is actually fucking horrible,Arsenal,Yes,jekawub,t1_jek8ndi

I yell at the tv during the game lmfao.,Arsenal,Yes,jekkozn,t1_jekjyus
It‚Äôs 1 game at a time brother and there‚Äôs more to life than football,Arsenal,Yes,jekoj2g,t1_jekjyus
"only so much you can do , just try and embrace it . it‚Äôs what makes it so exciting when the good thing happens anyways . if it was all easy and tame this whole thing would lose its magic",Arsenal,Yes,jekvq7h,t1_jekjyus
"Match thread, just don't read too many comments",Arsenal,Yes,jekleej,t1_jekjyus
"BHA (a) and BRE (a) are honestly the equivalent of top 4 away fixtures, those are two very difficult grounds to get good results at.",Arsenal,Yes,jel7kv5,t1_jel3hgp
"This is why it's crazy to me that people are suggesting City won't drop points until the end of the season. They played well today against a Liverpool team who showed them no respect and tried to play them at their own game which obviously was never going to work. The other teams won't be so generous. I think 20 points would guarantee the title, 18 would be my guess though.",Arsenal,Yes,jel5ja1,t1_jel3hgp
"It all depends who have anything to play for.

Conceivably Chelsea and Brentford will have nothing to play for and Bournemouth and Everton could be down.",Arsenal,Yes,jel8f68,t1_jel3hgp
"They‚Äôve reached the 5th stage of grief, acceptance.",Arsenal,Yes,jelgyxa,t1_jelfl4c
"They do this cause they know it will bring more views. It‚Äôs what arsenal fans want to see. Although not all of them, but I can say most of them just do it for the views and deep inside depressed looking at our form",Arsenal,Yes,jelo3jw,t1_jelfl4c
"I think there's a few reasons. One being we're good now and rightfully getting praise. There's really not been much for outside parties to comment on before this, maybe we get praise for a FA cup run or something but that's it. You're not going to get praise for a top 4 finish. Secondly I think we're an absolute goldmine for online content, my youtube algorithm is full of people making videos on how good Arsenal are. I'd say they do good numbers producing pro-Arsenal stuff.",Arsenal,Yes,jeloeyp,t1_jelfl4c
It‚Äôs for clicks,Arsenal,Yes,jemksi8,t1_jelfl4c
"We are easily the best team in the league to watch by the eye this season, from the start till now. So i think alot of neutrals like us for that.",Arsenal,Yes,jemcmeo,t1_jelfl4c
Yeah I think it is safe to assume City will not be dropping many points at all from now until the end. We need to win at Anfield. Draw is acceptable.,Arsenal,Yes,jekx6q6,t1_jekwqwe
"Agreed. We have to turn over Liverpool. If we do that and turn up and manage to scrape a draw at the Etihad (it's going to be tough) then we are tantalizingly close. I'm hoping Brighton away could be a banana peel for them but other than us their run in isn't that tough. Chelsea perhaps, but with how bad they've been I wouldn't bet on them doing us a favour. They might have a new manager bounce going on at this rate when they face them though.

Another thing to consider is that they have a lot of tough CL games coming up that could make their schedule in the PL more difficult to manage.",Arsenal,Yes,jel16pr,t1_jekwqwe
Agreed.,Arsenal,Yes,jein1e5,t1_jeil07z
"Lots of minutes in their legs over the last few years, plus zero midfield protection so they are constantly put under pressure.",Arsenal,Yes,jej5zix,t1_jej4jgh
"Make no mistake, team with most points going to win whole thing",Arsenal,Yes,jej73zu,t1_jej5cca
Really hoping Dyche can do us a solid and frustrate the shit out of city.,Arsenal,Yes,jemedjo,t1_jem4xbi
"Liverpool have been SHOCKING away, a draw would be a miracle. I honestly can see a proper drubbing then another shambles at the bridge only for these wastrels to turn up at home against us.",Arsenal,Yes,jeil5ak,t1_jeikt6h
"I don't put a 0-0 beyond them. City could be a little rusty too.

And lastly, they do turn up against City, I rarely remember them dropping points to City the last few years.

They've been atrocious this season but still beat City at Home which is better than what we did against them.",Arsenal,Yes,jeint2e,t1_jeikt6h
"Whoever advised him is an idiot/selfish prick. I wouldn't be surprised if Chelsea paid the agent a larger fee. 

Anyway, we really need to stop talking about him, it's getting a little pathetic now to see some of the comments making fun of him. Gives off small dick incel vibes",Arsenal,Yes,jek7nve,t1_jek69fa
"i got nothing against him personally and I would make the same call

unfortunately the amount of shit I read on this sub about Edu and Martinelli from our fans who got gaslit into thinking he‚Äôs a world class player has made me very petty when it comes to him",Arsenal,Yes,jekerbz,t1_jek69fa
"Agree, said the same. He looks like a list puppy desperate to please but not sure how to do it.",Arsenal,Yes,jek9ojm,t1_jek69fa
"Nope, he made his bed - could have dug his heels in and got a move to Arsenal, but the money talked more than the football.  I hope he flops unimaginably.",Arsenal,Yes,jekc8g6,t1_jek69fa
We‚Äôll get him in 2-3 years when he‚Äôs worth 30 mill or less,Arsenal,Yes,jekccov,t1_jek69fa

2- OptaJoe has posted the most madness he has in a while. Poggers.,Arsenal,Yes,jeitrfh,t1_jeitlve
"Rodri lucky not to be off the pitch wtf

If anyone lucky it‚Äôs City",Arsenal,Yes,jej1xl8,t1_jej1ubq
"Lol at the idea of Rodri being sent off. He‚Äôs the classic ‚Äòif that was Xhaka‚Äô.

Such a snide of a player and he‚Äôs got away with it all season.

But City are a terribly cynical team with their  rotational fouling.",Arsenal,Yes,jej2it3,t1_jej21dk
"lol Rodri getting sent off

whatever u huffin i want some",Arsenal,Yes,jej2xqs,t1_jej21dk
Agreed but I can bet good money they'll be very serious for our game.,Arsenal,Yes,jej5ltv,t1_jej5c54
"That's not a bad forward line by any stretch of the imagination.

In fact, it's quite good.",Arsenal,Yes,jej6f1q,t1_jej65rr
"I'm really hoping saka is benched because arteta thought he needed rest, and not because he has a precautionary injury",Arsenal,Yes,jej6iq5,t1_jej65rr
"Haaland doesn't create and requires service. If he does get the service, he's the silver bullet.",Arsenal,Yes,jej8ih5,t1_jej7psh
90 + 2‚Äô: Ward-Prowse goal kick zips straight past Ederson,Arsenal,Yes,jejbbks,t1_jejb6w9
"Foreign tourists coming to the stadium with 0 discernible interest in Arsenal is a big problem. Emirates atmosphere has improved ten fold but if you‚Äôre not in the North Bank or Clock End it‚Äôs dead. 

Yes, if you know the seat you should report it. Then they can catch the season ticket holder who is selling their seat to the touts.",Arsenal,Yes,jek560r,t1_jek4bfe
"Yeah agreed, did it against Palace. I won't ever choose seats on the lower halfway line again, the atmosphere there was dead, I also had American tourist next to me. Sweet old lady asked me who Vieira was lol.

I always choose the North Bank, either behind the goal or the wing. Cheaper tickets, and everyone is standing 24/7.",Arsenal,Yes,jek5awz,t1_jek4bfe
"I‚Äôm a ST holder and the number of half and halves and foreign tourists who make absolutely no noise has noticeably gone up. I suppose when you get good again there‚Äôs a period when the atmosphere improves, teaches a peak, and the goes back down again because of the influx of new fans and tourists. It‚Äôs so frustrating because I know people who usually just go to pubs as they‚Äôve been priced out who make so much more noise.",Arsenal,Yes,jek67l4,t1_jek4bfe
Would be nice but PL is not that kind of league.,Arsenal,Yes,jeikj0d,t1_jeijpkk
"I dream of this, but even if we reached 100pts, City would still probably be just a few games behind us. If we can beat everyone and City can beat everyone but us, the gap isn't that big.

The trick will be to loan our Hale End up-and-coming to the midtable teams to chip points off City.",Arsenal,Yes,jeikm86,t1_jeijpkk
Mate...,Arsenal,Yes,jeikgh4,t1_jeijpkk
In the past 5 or 6 seasons only Liverpool during lock down managed to lock the league early. There's so much competition in the epl. Most of the leagues you've said don't even have a consistent top 3 let alone top 6 and midtable sides like Brentford and Brighton who can beat any team on their day.,Arsenal,Yes,jeinjmn,t1_jeijpkk
We really could have done it this year,Arsenal,Yes,jeikr4r,t1_jeijpkk
5 points clear with 10 games to go is about as good as it gets in the prem,Arsenal,Yes,jeionca,t1_jeijpkk

"If you‚Äôre top of the table and you maintain your ppg, all else being equal, by definition you‚Äôll win the league.


Current points can be expressed as games played * ppg, so if you have the highest ppg, you‚Äôre at the top of the league.",Arsenal,Yes,jel8llq,t1_jel20qr
"Chelsea have nothing to play for in the league. Liverpool will be hard but remember we beat Tottenham home and away. They're a better side than Liverpool. Anfield atmosphere is a myth this season, we survived a more hostile atmosphere at the Spurs stadium",Arsenal,Yes,jelqq59,t1_jeloe6p
I‚Äôm quite confident we‚Äôll manage Chelsea. Liverpool away is going to be a problem though.,Arsenal,Yes,jeltylq,t1_jeloe6p
"Never really has, they've a small team, just most of their midfielders and forwards are interchangeable",Arsenal,Yes,jeiu07e,t1_jeito2j
They haven‚Äôt had a scary bench since before the pandemic. The ‚Äúcity can field two world class starting elevens‚Äù and ‚Äúcity‚Äôs second team can challenge for the league‚Äù takes are outdated,Arsenal,Yes,jeiui0h,t1_jeito2j
"If pool win today, we can afford to lose at anfield",Arsenal,Yes,jeiz0iw,t1_jeiyvr8
You are trying so hard to jinx yourself.,Arsenal,Yes,jej4kk2,t1_jej4dm5
We can probably take a loss and a draw but there is no margin for error beyond that. I really feel that we will need a result at the Etihad. Our fate is in our hands but it's going to be really hard.,Arsenal,Yes,jej5mrs,t1_jej4n1c

Jorginho has done well for us. Edu did well during the January window.,Arsenal,Yes,jejvqdo,t1_jejuts7

"2 less games played, that's only if they beat bayern no?",Arsenal,Yes,jekb3v6,t1_jeka6tn
Tactically definitely like pep. His vocabulary is arsene like though. Super into values and culture,Arsenal,Yes,jemch4z,t1_jeln0pz
"I feel he's closer to Pep. Arsene was loyal to the point of fault with players, I like that we're always looking to upgrade and cover for injuries better. I feel like this season for example, Wenger wouldn't have signed first-choice cover for Tierney, we probably would still have Leno in goal, we wouldn't have signed Trossard because of Smith-Rowe coming back. Our season would have fell apart with a Tierney injury, Smith-Rowe being rushed back. Feels like we have the team well covered now and of course you can unlucky with injuries but we're not sweating bricks over a predictable problem we all see coming.",Arsenal,Yes,jels2p7,t1_jeln0pz
More Pep.,Arsenal,Yes,jemryet,t1_jeln0pz
"Defend and play out like Pep, attack like Arsene",Arsenal,Yes,jelo4l0,t1_jeln0pz
"Definitely closer to Pep in most ways.

I don't see many similarities with Wenger.

But I also think he's very much his own man, he's not a Pep clone like neutrals say.",Arsenal,Yes,jelnxty,t1_jeln0pz
In terms of what,Arsenal,Yes,jelneuq,t1_jeln0pz
Pep and moyes imo,Arsenal,Yes,jelo4bw,t1_jeln0pz
"Doubt there's a new signing in our attack. On top of that there's still Nelson, Nketiah, Balogun and maybe ESR.",Arsenal,Yes,jemwn7j,t1_jemup7y
"Anfield or not, we've already beaten them once and we're 30 points ahead of them in the league. 

Our away form is also pretty formidable, they are very beatable we have no reason to be scared of them.",Arsenal,Yes,jek31ju,t1_jek2j92
"We have to win at at least 1 of Anfield, Etihad, St James‚Äô Park. At this point Anfield seems like the place where we‚Äôve got the best chance. A draw is acceptable but really we need a win",Arsenal,Yes,jek3faz,t1_jek2j92
"Bro, we‚Äôre literally 1st",Arsenal,Yes,jek4gcr,t1_jek2j92
what‚Äôs the latest ?,Arsenal,Yes,jektovz,t1_jekt9q6

Brighton are more of a threat than Liverpool,Arsenal,Yes,jeksvfd,t1_jeksn9f

They're only in the top four race because they are only behind us and city at home.",Arsenal,Yes,jeikiqu,t1_jeijc70
"We probably would have had both those 2 had it not been for Boehly. 

On the flip side we‚Äôd not have Trossard.",Arsenal,Yes,jelua58,t1_jelnwz5
"Felix is good

but Arteta is the saviour

any underperforming player that a club is stupid enough to spunk 100m into is saved by the counterfactual where Arteta managed them",Arsenal,Yes,jelyohu,t1_jelnwz5
"Trossard has been wonderful, but Jesus is not being kept out of this team by anything but an abundance of caution at this point.",Arsenal,Yes,jeiou1e,t1_jeiobuh
Happy with either,Arsenal,Yes,jeiosbm,t1_jeiobuh
I'm happy I don't have to make this decision,Arsenal,Yes,jeipn5l,t1_jeiobuh
"As much as it pains me, Trossard. But I'd be more than happy for Jesus to prove me wrong",Arsenal,Yes,jeioq26,t1_jeiobuh
"Not first. He brings so much to the team its unreal.

Genuinely don't know if any other team in Europe has a left back that can do what he can",Arsenal,Yes,jeiqjpw,t1_jeiqg8h
"Mikel‚Äôs system is hugely dependent on an effective overload in the middle of the park. As good as tierney has been for us, even if him or Tomi were in his place at starting LB, we‚Äôd be missing his ball carrying & press resistant abilities let alone his penchant to pick out some really smart passes that break lines especially in low blocks. The assist to Saka at home against Everton comes to mind but i‚Äôm sure there are loads more. Haven‚Äôt even got to the intangibles like his leadership abilities and experience in competing for and winning the league. Without Zinny pushing up to midfield, we‚Äôd be a lot more easier to press in central areas too. Huge player for us, HUGE.",Arsenal,Yes,jeiqzjj,t1_jeiqg8h
"We'd have had to play Cedric on the league because of Tomi and Tierney's injury issues

Pretty sure a new left back would have been bought, Zinchenko was 2nd choice anyway",Arsenal,Yes,jeirmzr,t1_jeiqg8h
"Comfortably second, but Closer to United than city. I can think of at least 3 games that he was pivotal for us.

I‚Äôd say mid 50s in points.",Arsenal,Yes,jeiqtgz,t1_jeiqg8h
We'd be fogged.,Arsenal,Yes,jeirih2,t1_jeiqg8h

"The Club decided to run with vibes rather than properly backing/refreshing the team and this is the result. Serves as a warning signs for us. 

Once Partey and Xhaka's times are up, hope we have good replacements already in within the team. Investing again this summer is key, especially in the midfield",Arsenal,Yes,jej7y8a,t1_jej6pdr
"On the other hand, we play this team next.",Arsenal,Yes,jej8kw6,t1_jej7eaf
Lmao. There‚Äôs a small set of American fans who believe we‚Äôre duty-bound to support Americans in everything they do. It‚Äôs fucking stupid. We have the USMNT for that,Arsenal,Yes,jejmt7h,t1_jejmm40
Let's not forget hat trick hero Trossard,Arsenal,Yes,jek59le,t1_jejw0q7
"He had to be. We can‚Äôt risk him on full 90‚Äôs just yet so close from a surgery. Good he was a bit sad, keep him hungry",Arsenal,Yes,jekhqjm,t1_jekhbnj

Let‚Äôs not act like he didn‚Äôt have a crazy turnaround and at the time performed to a standard where a salary raise made sense to the public eye.,Arsenal,Yes,jel70fa,t1_jel3q3b
"I mean those reactions were reasonable at the time. Xhaka, let‚Äôs face it, was below average to average throughout most of his Arsenal career.

He has been exceptional this season, but let‚Äôs not pretend people saw this level of performance coming. The change in role and reduced defensive responsibilities have helped him a lot and I do wonder how his earlier season performances would have been helped if we had tried to work around his weaknesses earlier in his time here.",Arsenal,Yes,jel7c7a,t1_jel3q3b
You made a spelling and punctuation mistake. You‚Äôre delusional.,Arsenal,Yes,jeior6z,t1_jeiogq7
">Historically it has been a good ground for us, when we were the better team, as we are now.

It's a tough ground to go to, even in Wenger's absolute prime (1997-2005) we only won there twice in the league. But let's hope we can grab a win, they're a team in disarray, their midfield is a mess and their defenders are at sea.",Arsenal,Yes,jeksnkm,t1_jeklbfk
Agree with the first line but we've always had a good team. Good enough to win at Anfield with difficulty. But yeah this team is on another level,Arsenal,Yes,jeklm8u,t1_jeklbfk

"Liverpool have been crap both away and home, which is why i won‚Äôt stop laughing at United. They‚Äôve only scored more than 2 goals at Anfield TWICE! One against Palace and the other against‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..LOL!",Arsenal,Yes,jeiqwuz,t1_jeiqhlj
Newcastle out-xGd them despite having 10 men and spurs are awful. I don't rate Liverpool this season home or away. If we don't win at their ground we're bottlers,Arsenal,Yes,jeir72c,t1_jeiqhlj

"I used to watch them a lot in those bad years( 2018-2021). They are an entire football lesson. Sure they have their billions but they could play Stones as DM and Ake as a winger and still obliterate you.

Whatever happens Martinelli is locked in. He always skins Trent alive for all he‚Äôs worth. Need to exploit that.,Arsenal,Yes,jemvk6j,t1_jemt65k
"Martinelli starts with Jesus and Saka. Their backline is kind of slow and they like pushing their fullbacks up. Martinelli is a god at transitions. 

Matter of fact, unless we are 3-0 up or there is an injury, that should remain unchanged until 80'.",Arsenal,Yes,jemtpfp,t1_jemt65k
Start EM / Jesus/ Saka and have Trossard come in at 60 mins,Arsenal,Yes,jemwgi1,t1_jemt65k
Martinelli/Jesus/Saka. Trossard in around the 60‚Äô,Arsenal,Yes,jemyval,t1_jemt65k
Got to start the pace Vs that defence so Trossard is unfortunately going to be Vs Jesus for the striker position.,Arsenal,Yes,jemzju3,t1_jemt65k
Earlier this break you said we shouldn‚Äôt underestimate them because of the away tie.,Arsenal,Yes,jeimblm,t1_jeilgqu
"It is fucking hilarious to me that fans *still* say this shite.

We are having the season of our lives. And yet, 1 of the 3 games we have lost was against Everton, a team in 15th. 1/3 of the games we have drawn was against Southampton, a team in 20th. We are not alone either, as Southampton have beaten City and drawn with United this season as well. The last time we faced Leeds earlier this reason we managed a narrow 1-0 win.

In the Premier League, anyone can drop points to anyone. This ""no excuses"" crap is just not representative of reality.",Arsenal,Yes,jeiocfs,t1_jeilgqu
Worried about Salah too. Liverpool at home is a different animal. They have 3rd best home records this season. Salah is back on form now so let's hope Ziny will keep him quiet.,Arsenal,Yes,jel4zwh,t1_jel1tgv
"Might be a good game to start Tierney, either way I trust Arteta to set us up to win",Arsenal,Yes,jel22jn,t1_jel1tgv

"They don't talk about it because they know they won't win it.

It's L'Equipe, they're hilariously biased against English teams regardless of the players nationalities.

The fact Henry never won one is just madness.",Arsenal,Yes,jeirxmw,t1_jeirnx4
"With Messi and Ronaldo it just hasn't been a thing at all in the last 15 years.

Individual awards aren't really important in football, Americans ironically because it's French, are the ones who have made it into a much bigger deal than it is imo.",Arsenal,Yes,jeiupy0,t1_jeirnx4
"I think there are two issues re: Owen:

1.	That it‚Äôs obviously quite a political award, and Owen wasn‚Äôt exactly a consensus best player in the world- he had a very good season.  You could say similar about Keegan (and maybe it was still a European award back then?).
2.	Messi and Cronaldo‚Äôs dominance of the last decade and a bit mean that a one time winner in the past seems less impressive than it did before.

It‚Äôs not a great statement for a player to make in a team sport. Everyone knows players want it, but saying it publicly‚Ä¶",Arsenal,Yes,jeis6vi,t1_jeirnx4
Because almost all the best English players are in the premier league. At this league is always overlooked for that award for some reason. So no one bothers to care.,Arsenal,Yes,jeirw61,t1_jeirnx4
Not sure why this is being downvoted btw. He‚Äôs legit not starting.,Arsenal,Yes,jej4vfr,t1_jej4plh

"I disagree on dropping points. We cannot afford to drop the points as Man City have shown that they can catch the 1st place team if the 1st place drops points I.e. Liverpool 18/19 and last season.

"He‚Äôs got pace and nothing else. Had a one on one with the keeper, no defenders anywhere near, and just dribbled it at him like ruined cumshot. It was sad, honestly. Otherwise he was mostly invisible, just not impactful on the game at all. 

I don‚Äôt know what Potter‚Äôs on about over there. They‚Äôve found some lineups that have gotten them some points, but he keeps pulling it apart to rotate the squad and they‚Äôre losing as a result.",Arsenal,Yes,jekx78z,t1_jekphq5
Trossard is starting on the right I heard. Amario Cozier Duberry got added to the squad last minute after playing last night so would make sense.,Arsenal,Yes,jeit15p,t1_jeisnm3
I thought it was weird that he didn‚Äôt take a picture with his potm award‚Ä¶.well we should be able to do it against Leeds without him.,Arsenal,Yes,jeisx9w,t1_jeisnm3
"Illness is fine, we have Trossard who can come in while Jesus or Martinelli play on the right, just make sure Saka gets down that Sudafed and lathers Vicks vapour rub all over his body. As long it isnt a fucking injury, we‚Äôre good.",Arsenal,Yes,jeisvef,t1_jeisnm3

"Dunno, Socceraid uses mixed teams now and to be honest that just highlights the massive physical disparity. It still works because they're better than the celebrities but if it were just prime top level men it wouldn't be pretty.

"A day of challenges with a ball or am advert could work. A game on the other hand, even a friendly, would be a joke - the men would be way too fast and strong, or it'd be embarrassing as they'd be so obviously not trying to do anything",Arsenal,Yes,jeim1ke,t1_jeiivft
Most women's teams tend to be on par with U-16s so I doubt anybody who knows what they're talking about would want that.,Arsenal,Yes,jeijnmk,t1_jeiivft
"Like Gabriel Jesus and Miedema vs Trossard and Mead or something like that?

Idk if it would promote us significantly as it's all Arsenal but it couldn't hurt at all. But I'd definitely watch it.",Arsenal,Yes,jeij6bs,t1_jeiivft

"He didn't, he was already captain.",Arsenal,Yes,jeix5gv,t1_jeiw48v
Emery made Auba captain.,Arsenal,Yes,jeiwnyg,t1_jeiw48v

"He was really well liked.

He was the most senior starter.

He was our best player.

He got dropped/behaved poorly when his form went.",Arsenal,Yes,jeiwpmj,t1_jeiw48v
He wasn't clearly a bad example. There are different types of captains/leaders. He was the social glue of the changing room and he led on the pitch in his performances by being the best player.,Arsenal,Yes,jeix6dk,t1_jeiw48v

35 tops.",Arsenal,Yes,jelgaev,t1_jelcylo

"Absolutely not. 

I‚Äôll rather we take that money and spend it on Rice and whatever position we need to reinforce. The Partey replacement is absolutely key to our success. Our season last year fell apart when he was injured, I‚Äôll rather not see that happen again.

I don't think we need to rely on Liverpool mate lol. I think if we continue winning its going to get harder and harder when there's 5 games left. City have been average.,Arsenal,Yes,jej3ru7,t1_jej3nw4

"Except we were not willing to pay 100M, we were willing to pay a lot if he meets bonuses that are not easy to achieve. We didn't just give 100M to Shakhtar for good reasons, we know there's a good chance he is not worth that much.",Arsenal,Yes,jeiq22c,t1_jeiovib

"They haven't been bad at home. They're third in the home form table, five points behind us but with a game less played at home.",Arsenal,Yes,jeiqzqr,t1_jeiqwuz
They're still 9-2-1 at home. That's decent.,Arsenal,Yes,jeir12t,t1_jeiqwuz
Well City didn't win there did they. Just let me overdose on scouser hopium in peace thank you,Arsenal,Yes,jeirn5b,t1_jeirc6z
Would rattle the entire league!,Arsenal,Yes,jeiszph,t1_jeisw2s
Decades,Arsenal,Yes,jemjo5m,t1_jemgl2r

im guessing the resurrection of Jesus,Arsenal,Yes,jeiwdje,t1_jeiw2dp
"died on friday , resurrected on sunday üôè",Arsenal,Yes,jeiye9f,t1_jeiyauc
He then came back for round 2,Arsenal,Yes,jeizahj,t1_jeiyauc
He rose on Easter Sunday though,Arsenal,Yes,jeizqtv,t1_jeiyauc
"Well considering fans on this sub were crying and carrying on like Holding was going to be the downfall of this title charge it's understandable that people are getting behind him and trying to giving him some encouragement.

He's a back up player, so of course he's not going to be at the level that Saliba is but did a perfectly good job today.

It's nice to give credit where it's due.",Arsenal,Yes,jekj0rv,t1_jek6jua
"yeah, but i think he might be on the bench (just guessing from the illness rumours)",Arsenal,Yes,jeiuqip,t1_jeiuk8i
"Yes. Prec is just a fan but sees the squad as they travel so is always reliable, and I‚Äôve never seen teamnewsandtix get anything wrong.",Arsenal,Yes,jeiuv1v,t1_jeiuk8i
they are a stalker,Arsenal,Yes,jeiwpsu,t1_jeiuk8i
Diaz will be hella rusty tbh,Arsenal,Yes,jej46e5,t1_jej3uko
"They can‚Äôt play Salah, Diaz, Jota, Nunez and Gakpo all at the same time so I don‚Äôt think Diaz coming back changes them in any way

Thiago will help keep the ball and build, but that midfield is still horrific. 

Just think it‚Äôs one of those games where Salah will play like his prime",Arsenal,Yes,jej4ph0,t1_jej3uko
Agree to disagree. Anytime I see him he is the clockwork of their offense. It takes a lot of talent to get a team that are often underdogs in dangerous positions.,Arsenal,Yes,jejsdrw,t1_jejs654
"Wouldn't be mad at that. Counterpoint though, Trossard has already rocked up to anfield and walked away with 3 goals. It matters a little bit at least, depends how much you value that though.

I'm torn tbh",Arsenal,Yes,jeklnd3,t1_jekla2g
"Can't drop him. I know the temptation will be to run the game but we need transitions. If Liverpool want to excite their fans by throwing bodies forward, it will be fun seeing Martinelli race with VVD and TAA.",Arsenal,Yes,jeky87n,t1_jekndps
"no chance imo, he was bagging goals for fun in March.",Arsenal,Yes,jel84h4,t1_jekndps
"https://www.youtube.com/live/1pjDh1KvQHU?feature=share

No there are. They are mighty afraid of us equalling their pl record just like that,Arsenal,Yes,jej1rka,t1_jej1mp4

"For some reason?

It's L'Equipe....",Arsenal,Yes,jeiukub,t1_jeirw61
It happens in the women‚Äôs game as well. It‚Äôs so biased toward players playing in Europe.,Arsenal,Yes,jeius4h,t1_jeirw61

"We can.  You can't peak every week for 10 weeks in a row. You have to manage your performance over the 10 weeks.

I think you can get away with saying something like 3 cup finals. 10 is a ridiculous number.",Arsenal,Yes,jeiuihd,t1_jeiudvg
"> We have to win most of the fixtures this month

So we can afford to drop points?",Arsenal,Yes,jeivt70,t1_jeivl3g
We can literally avoid to drop 4 points. Were 5 points ahead. That's how leagues work.,Arsenal,Yes,jeiw2pd,t1_jeivl3g

The counter jinxes worked,Arsenal,Yes,jeis4lb,t1_jeis13l
"It's at Anfield. They have the second best defensive record in the league at home this season and have the most clinical set of attackers in the league.

We're good at home and away.",Arsenal,Yes,jej5opi,t1_jej5hz1

"We were expecting/hoping they would drop two points at least vs liverpool but instead they smashed them.

So they have +2 points then we were expecting",Arsenal,Yes,jekhq8w,t1_jekgk06

Anfield where we have got smoked every season for years,Arsenal,Yes,jek1xpr,t1_jejzw1m
yes,Arsenal,Yes,jek0b6c,t1_jejzw1m
I think that‚Äôs right. Haaland can score 40 goals if he wants but Martinelli and Saka will be sharing the golden boot when we have a GD of 50 compared to City‚Äôs 48,Arsenal,Yes,jeik1qb,t1_jeijfh8
I'm still not ruling out the possibility it was a massive jebait.,Arsenal,Yes,jeiqm0h,t1_jeiq22c

"I missed out on Leeds because I got picky. I thought I had a few more days but had no luck on the tx.

Honestly all Vieira needs is to bulk up. He's very good technically.,Arsenal,Yes,jelhff3,t1_jekzouw

"Scenes when City drop points at Southampton for no reason. Well, not for no reason, I think City this season often play down to worse teams. Obviously there‚Äôs a limit on this, but think of how they played Palace‚Äîand Southampton are *desperate*.",Arsenal,Yes,jekws30,t1_jekt4rf
"That man U smashing was at Anfield and Liverpool really don't hate City, no one hates City not even United.",Arsenal,Yes,jeikuzm,t1_jeikqfr

nope,Arsenal,Yes,jeis3sl,t1_jeirszl
"Think this is more ridiculous to tell someone trying to achieve something that they don‚Äôt need to try hard in 7/10 games. 

The psychology is very important here. Haven‚Äôt done so well this yeah by taking games casually all the games we have started strongly turned into comfortable wins",Arsenal,Yes,jeiuwzt,t1_jeiuihd
"Lol why are you being so literal? The boys want 10/10. Aim for the stars and you'll at least achieve the moon.

Telling them they can afford to lose games invokes a poor and lazy mentality in the camp. They players tell themselves 10 Cup finals because they want to motivate themselves and each other to go all out in every match.",Arsenal,Yes,jeivgj5,t1_jeiuihd
"Once we've sealed the title but for now, we can't afford to drop points otherwise Man City can catch us up.

Hopefully Man City will drop points considering the run of fixtures they have and the two games against Bayern in the CL.",Arsenal,Yes,jeiw10i,t1_jeivt70

"It was the Big Penny Social (used to be called Trumen's Social Club) in Black horse Lane. They have a massive warehouse style room that is great for big games.

"Not sure what point you are making. It's a ground we've won the league ,how does that disprove what I said",Arsenal,Yes,jel9ysc,t1_jel9t91
Based on what do you think he‚Äôs a good player? Shown nothing apart from a half season in the ukranian league and he‚Äôs already 22. Would give him time if he‚Äôs like 18 and has more time to develop. Was shit in the international games recently too.,Arsenal,Yes,jeks43j,t1_jekqoob
I was literally begging the club not to sign him for whatever we bidded lol,Arsenal,Yes,jelf2eu,t1_jel9fyi
Under arteta. Klopp is paraded around as one of the greatest managers ever to grace the pl but this rookie who's in his first manager job could equal his pl total,Arsenal,Yes,jej2ukj,t1_jej21xs
"And where did I say they don't need to try hard in 7/10 games?

They should try hard in all of the games. They just shouldn't make every game an Al or nothing cup final. Do you understand the mental and physical effort and stress that goes into performing in a cup final? It's unsustainable for 10 weeks.

And to reiterate, I've not once said we should take games casually. You've invented that viewpoint and tried to put it on me.

I actually think Holding Vs Spurs last season is an example of playing with too much emotional energy and losing control. Zidane in the WC final. Lehman in the 06 final.",Arsenal,Yes,jeivicn,t1_jeiuwzt
"Because when use correctly it's a literal saying.  We have 1 shot here, were either gonna win or die trying.

Actually yeah you're right it should be 38 cup finals. If every game is a cup final it loses all significance cause it's just another game. It's pretty simple to follow.",Arsenal,Yes,jeiw1ej,t1_jeivgj5

"Even if they don't, we can take them. Especially with that forward line.

Doesn't matter. They've been mediocre all season, and it's nothing new.",Arsenal,Yes,jej73ca,t1_jej6xys

Stylistically nothing alike, but if you reduce it as much as possible then they are certainly twins.",Arsenal,Yes,jen97jv,t1_jem8rch
"I said we should aim to maintain a peak across 10 games instead of trying to peak for every game. If you've ever seen a peak you know it's impossible to peak repeatedly on demand.

You assumed what I was arguing for and got it wrong. I never said we shouldn't put effort in.

"This is just semantics for game management‚Ä¶so it‚Äôs no difference from what I said. 

My assumption was correct though, you‚Äôre saying the players should manage their load which is the same as not to go all out in every game. That coupled with the idea that we don‚Äôt need to win every game. 

Haha quite ironic from someone who doesn‚Äôt understand the cup final mentality. But great we can end here, you have enough downvotes as it is.",Arsenal,Yes,jej4ru7,t1_jej1lc2
"Yeah, so forget those jokers, their fans, and their sub.

Not worth our time.

Their greatest achievements are simply our failures.",Arsenal,Yes,jejajwn,t1_jejae81
All I‚Äôm saying is I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable for them to be happy with a Liverpool win because a City win would be a blow for them in the top 4 race (and additionally for those who care for our title chances).

1. Spent 8 years at River showing he is the definition of a long-term manager who can carry out a project(more than any of the other linked candidates).
2. Won 14 trophies at River Plate which is more than any of the other linked candidates and that he is a proven winner.
3. Has a defined tactical philosophy that aims to attack the central channels while also getting the best out of our attacking fullbacks in Reece and Chilly. However, he is also willing to be tactically flexible if needed.
4. Has a great track record of developing youth and integrating new players due to an ever-changing squad that would have key players get poached by clubs in Europe every year.
5. Has a fiery personality that would light a fire under this squad(and let's be real, some of them need this).

All in all, I do believe it would be a gigantic risk, especially given the fact that he has no experience managing in Europe, and doesn't seem to speak English to a great degree. And there is no way he deserves 10 million a year given that this would be his first job in Europe. That being said, he ticks many of the boxes we are looking for, on top of the fact that he ticks those boxes way more than any of the other potential managers we are linked to.

The problems lies in the fact we've spent an audacious amount of money, but haven't bothered to invest in a single proven goalscorer. Our possession is usually good, defending generally good (dependant on selection ofcourse), and chance creation is positive, but every game we see countless opportunities with no end product in the final third (last night's game a prime example). 

We turned to Aubameyang in the summer, who has a well documented attitude problem akin to Lukaku, and was rapidly on the decline of his career age wise too. It's no wonder that hasn't worked out. Kai is just not good enough as an out and out striker, never will be - noone is going to get him suddenly scoring 20 goals a season.

Perhaps Nkunku will turn things around, but we definitely need an additional striker signing so we aren't putting all of our eggs in one basket (remember how we signed Timo based on his form and performances for Liepzig).

No Chalobah is a joke. No Datro Fofana is a joke. The fact that Deadwood is going to get more chances over them once the new manager comes in is going to be so annoying. Boehly‚Äôs commitment to young players, Academy or otherwise is proving to be a joke.

Surely whoever comes in will want a striker, another midfielder, and a new keeper.

Even if he isn't a long term manager (proving at Roma so far that if the owners back him, he can be) he is a great manager to build a lasting winning mentality in your players.

"I have a few issues with that approach. First with that would be Lampard is halfway between a caretaker-caliber manager and a permanent one (especially for this club). The feeling of him coming back in a temp role, with his history with the club, at least brings up the question of it turning into a permanent role.

Second, there are two great options at the moment in Nagelsmann and Enrique (I prefer one but would be happy with both), both of whom I would prefer tactically at this point. Unless the one they decide on specifically has a reason *not* to sign on until the summer, I don't really think we'll have any better options come summer. Do you think any specific better options would come along?

Third, tied to the second one, I would rather give one of those two more time to gel with the players than have them switch from three systems in less than a year.

And finally, a manager having the rest of this season to instill those tactics and give players the opportunity to distinguish themselves therein also gives us the summer window to get the club down to a halfway-reasonable number of players rather than the bloated mass we currently have.",Chelsea,Yes,jf21t34,t1_jf1z47h

">My honest thoughts

My honest thoughts. 

>GK hopefully Slonana is the long term answer but one of Mendy or Arrizabalaga has to go and new option brought in this summer. 

Agree with this. I hope Kepa is the one to leave as he has a couple of incapabilities in his game. Mendy should be okayish as a second choice. Send Slonina on loan for about 2 seasons and we will be needing a stop-gap for about 2 seasons till Slonina joins the first team. No one comes to mind currently. 

>CM two of Gallagher, Loftus-Cheek/Mount need to go sign a DM. 

RLC is nonnegotiable. He should leave. Part of me wants Mount to stay, while Gallagher to go on a loan to a team where he can get better minutes. Chukwuemeka and Hallshould be loaned as well. Zakaria should be returned. For the DM, one of Rice, Ugarte, V. Souza or Hjulmand in order of preference. 

>Fwd one of Havertz or Felix needs to be not here next season and in their place a Striker.

Neither ought to be. Return F√©lix and sell Kai. He's done enough damage. Get Enes √únal or Goncalo Ramos or H√∏jlund or Vlahovic if available for reasonable price. Or even Toney as a stop-gap. Play Broja for depth. Also, we need a left-footed out-and-out winger; Facundo Torres is one to look out for.

GK: New GK, Mendy, Bettinelli. 

CB: Fofana, Koulibaly, Silva, Badiashile, Colwill. 

FB/WB: Gusto, James, Cucurella, Chilwell. 

DM/CM: New DM, Chalobah, Kante, Enzo, Kovacic, Mount.

WF: Sterling, Mudryk, Nkunku, Madueke, Pulisic/F. Torres

ST: New ST, Broja.

That's a wrap of 25-man squad.",Chelsea,Yes,jf1gyxk,t1_jf0sxij

"Couldn‚Äôt agree more, squad will be so much better balanced. Tbh I‚Äôm leaning towards it making more sense to sell Mount and Ruben for hopefully 80-90m combined, don‚Äôt sign Felix permanently and also selling both Pulisic and Ziyech for about 50m combined. That‚Äôs 140m right there, hopefully would allow us to sign one Ivan Toney and a solid DM.

"Weirdly, that's helping my outlook because I get prone to thinking ""if we hadn't drawn against Everton, West Ham, NF, etc. we'd be within spitting distance of CL places"".  Not that I think we've been anywhere near good enough to deserve that positioning, but we've had plenty of dropped points against shit teams that would have put us much higher up the table.  But you're right, we're not all that far from being much lower too.

Sad when ""at least we're not in a relegation battle"" is positive Chelsea thinking but here we are.",Chelsea,Yes,jf3kbrb,t1_jf3d2ao
"Enrique has said publicly a few times that he has his sights set on a job in England, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he is our backup in case nagelsmann goes to Madrid",Chelsea,Yes,jf5b41e,t1_jf5645l
I‚Äôd be happy with Ancelotti again. Sure he‚Äôd come back if Real Madrid didn‚Äôt want him,Chelsea,Yes,jf5o9ra,t1_jf5645l
"He is not, he just reckless",Chelsea,Yes,jf0ogcq,t1_jf0nyk8
"Not really, recruitment on the field was mostly down to roman and tuchel - or temporary singings (joao)

Havertz, lukaku, kovacic, aubameyang 

The fact that boelhy actually trying to solve the creative issue romans reign left us (since hazard fabregas left)",Chelsea,Yes,jf0qkmx,t1_jf0nyk8
yes american measurements are clearly the pinnacle of logic.,Chelsea,Yes,jf0vztf,t1_jf0qw21
"Tradition.

Back in the day wages used to be capped at a set amount (¬£20 from memory), then a bloke by the name of Jimmy Hill lead a campaign against the FA to have the cap removed. This eventually lead to a player that's name currently escapes me becoming the first ¬£100 per-week player, and since then wages have remained addressed as such.

You also have to remember football was a working class game, and working class people were also paid per week, so it was also a relatable way of addressing things.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0y9y6,t1_jf0qw21
"I think it‚Äôs the media which like it because it seems the most extreme. ¬£10m a year doesn‚Äôt sound extreme as ¬£190,000 a week when most people are working for ¬£500 a week.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0ugyy,t1_jf0qw21
"I think it‚Äôs a weird hangover from when footballers were viewed similarly to factory workers, who were paid weekly wages. Maybe around the beginning of the 20th century. Now, I believe footballers are paid in the form of a monthly salary, like many ‚Äòcorporate‚Äô, white collar workers.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0tel4,t1_jf0qw21
"I‚Äôm here for the ride personally, after how uninspiring potter was I‚Äôm perfectly happy with having a interim who loves the club and is a complete passion merchant lol",Chelsea,Yes,jf5b8iy,t1_jf4xq1x
I hope Lamps leads us to the third.,Chelsea,Yes,jf5qy6h,t1_jf4xq1x
How exactly is felix world class??,Chelsea,Yes,jf0rwzn,t1_jf0ov6i
Only Kante in that list can be considered ‚Äúworld class‚Äù. And even then Kante MAY have dropped off. Tired of the term ‚ÄúWorld Class‚Äù been thrown around. Like Arsenal kids call Saka and Martinelli world class players. But World Class players would not put us in 11th place. Doesn‚Äôt matter if we had Potter in charge.,Chelsea,Yes,jf0z6wj,t1_jf0ov6i
"Kovacic comically wastes about 4-5 chances a game with his awful shooting and he generally was never good at even passing in the final 3rd. But I'd resign him if we could cuz I assume he can get back his world class ball carrying/workhorse energy, even though it's not been as good as under tuchel lately. He's a great piece.

Joao is someone I am not sold on yet, he might be fool's gold if it's a big fee. He does a lot of things that look great and he's generally good away from the box, but of all of our attackers, his decision making and finishing around the box might be the worst. If it's a good fee maybe, and he's still got a good amount of games left to impress/change minds.

Everyone else I pretty much agree on.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0pi4q,t1_jf0ov6i
"You saw that apathetic performance from Kovacic and said yeah we need to keep him. He‚Äôs been uninterested for a year now. Jogging up the pitch, doing the bare minimum. He doesn‚Äôt deserve to make the team on form let alone sign an extension. We have two young midfielders who have proven better than him this season but they aren‚Äôt expensive transfers so they can‚Äôt play",Chelsea,Yes,jf0r6ar,t1_jf0ov6i
"Side note, Frank really needs to be an assistant under a top coach",Chelsea,Yes,jf1krfy,t1_jf1g77i
He's not done much besides manage a middling Spain squad to mixed results.,Chelsea,Yes,jf1ox7c,t1_jf1hnlp
Bc he‚Äôs a shiny new toy and not Potter,Chelsea,Yes,jf1p9r9,t1_jf1hnlp
He has only managed a fairly shit generation of Spain since.,Chelsea,Yes,jf1z4oy,t1_jf1hnlp
"Lol. We beat Man City at home, did the double over Spurs, Won against Arsenal at Emirates


And the Bayern team you are talking about was head and shoulders above everyone in the Europe, they won 8-2 against Barcelona.",Chelsea,Yes,jf37fbb,t1_jf35k86
Chelsea have beaten exactly 0 teams in the top 10 of the PL under Potter. I dont think his assistant was going to fare any better,Chelsea,Yes,jf3dw6u,t1_jf35k86

We didn't play for a draw we were just shite.,Chelsea,Yes,jf0u89d,t1_jf0tp93
Did we? If playing for a draw means players not being able to finish simple chances then we did. But we created so much.,Chelsea,Yes,jf0tz5x,t1_jf0tp93

"These are some good names, Ivan toney and Joao palinha are so so good. I think we can do with someone better than savic",Chelsea,Yes,jf0q5rz,t1_jf0pmma
We need experienced and tough professionals. We have no character and now azpi is going we only have Thiago Silva as a model pro. Alot of our players seem feckless and immature. Havertz and mount is prime examples,Chelsea,Yes,jf0qmfh,t1_jf0pmma
"I think Klopp will take time off and I honestly can't see him working out here.  
But on a sidenote, I'm quite baffled by his record at Liverpool. The recent years insane form for Liverpool has completely wiped his lackluster start. Klopp ""only"" has a 59% winrate for Pool and it is ""only"" 3 percentage points higher than his Dortmund tenure.",Chelsea,Yes,jf1t0f1,t1_jf1gcn3
That as soon as things go slightly wrong our fans will eat him alive because of his Spursy past,Chelsea,Yes,jf200ik,t1_jf1vd7f
I think Poch is underrated. He‚Äôs been so interlinked with spurs legacy that everyone thinks he‚Äôs shit despite really over performing with the spurs team that he had. Despite that I‚Äôd still rate Enrique and Naaglesman higher,Chelsea,Yes,jf1yol3,t1_jf1vd7f
Would rather be rolled over by Madrid than continue watching as we get rolled over by the likes of Southampton,Chelsea,Yes,jf3cf7x,t1_jf3777f

"Fuck those teams, we arent getting padt them even if we play 10 times this season. This pool team, who we cant score against, got battered by 10 goals against those 2 teams.

This is just to stable the ship. And i would take him a 100 times over potter's leftalong, who literally works and speaks like him. As people are saying, we may need to become pashun fc and these players need to be reminded who they play for.

Lamps + cole, and if jt comes along too, is the best possible thing we can get to invigorate the players, (lacking drogba i guess for the end product)..

The anger from the fans should come if we try to get him permanent. Its absolutely a good thing we arent rushing for julian or Enrique.",Chelsea,Yes,jf62xx3,t1_jf5yrv1
"We ended Spurs' title challenge, it's only natural we end Arsenal's.",Chelsea,Yes,jf44gxn,t1_jf43ut4
the issue has been here for while to be honest probably since 17/18. You can even argue during the 16/17 title win we didnt really  win that many points from losing postions,Chelsea,Yes,jf0z45c,t1_jf0yvsq
"I think the bigger point is that Emery vs Potter has never been a competition

Emery has been to 5 Europa league finals with 3 different clubs (winning 4 of them)

Potters Brighton won 5 home games last season.

If we'd hired Emery I'm certain we'd be 3rd now.  If Villa had hired Potter they'd have gone down this year.

Can't put a price on a top quality manager.",Chelsea,No,jf1sy4j,t1_jf1q1t3
It's almost as though Potter was still in charge. Bruno didn't even look to do anything different from Potter.,Chelsea,Yes,jf0qml2,t1_jf0nugl
"That's actually a very good one. It might be a coincidence, but when he signed a new contract in 2018 worth ¬£150,000 per week, that's when he started to fall off.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0w5b1,t1_jf0u4ia
"Yeah I suppose we don't have big egos in the dressing room either. I think he'll have to make some tough decisions given how large the squad is but it's also short-term so I don't think he'll be fretting too much. I'm sure he rates the likes of Ziyech, Auba etc but think he won't really use them as they are basically gone in the summer.",Chelsea,Yes,jf3dce4,t1_jf36uqw
Who cares? It‚Äôs fucking Rory Jennings. Wasn‚Äôt this guy pretty hard for Potter?,Chelsea,Yes,jf0z9l7,t1_jf0z0nm

"He didn't look shaky much. He won 6 tackles, committed 0 fouls, won 7/12 duels, lost possession only 6 times. For context KK and Wes lost possession 17 and 10 times respectively.",Chelsea,Yes,jf1ca7j,t1_jf0yxvd
"Our defense and midfield was suffocating yesterday, I don't think he gave up anything resembling a good opportunity, but relying on just four attackers was not working.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0q8s1,t1_jf0oxuy
"As well as that, wasn‚Äôt Tuchel the last PSG manager to go for more than a season? And even then it was only 2 seasons",Chelsea,Yes,jf1z1bl,t1_jf1q1f0
"On what planet did Leipzig have better league seasons under Hassenhuttl and Rangnick than Nagelsmann?

"Yeah I know literally everyone else isn't great either but last night... That was like watching Bambi on ice. He really can't keep playing when playing this badly.

"Looks more likely to get goals for us based on his 0 goals for us so far? I won‚Äôt knock him because he hasn‚Äôt been given the chance, but he looks *more* likely to get goals for us? Pure hopium",Chelsea,Yes,jf0zfta,t1_jf0uprd
"He‚Äôs terrible, I think it‚Äôs best for him to get a loan",Chelsea,Yes,jf0w22k,t1_jf0uprd
I honestly thought he was injured with how little play time he gets,Chelsea,Yes,jf107id,t1_jf0uprd
I don't think it's that easy to make a mark in a span of 2-3 days when you were an assistant coach just a few days ago. Obviously he would use the system already there and play it safe anyone in his place would.,Chelsea,Yes,jf34rzb,t1_jf30p3e
"Bruno is not one to blame for our loss. Felix, Kovacic and Havertz not being able to score clear cut chances are one to blame

Edit: *draw. Not a loss. Felt like a loss tho",Chelsea,Yes,jf2qayz,t1_jf2obw5
You're saying Nagelsmann doesn't have experience outside of Germany but the only experience Luis Enrique has outside of Spain is a Roma spell where he was terrible and got sacked after 1 season,Chelsea,Yes,jf17ozr,t1_jf174q1
"Well, for how ridicules it sounds, Nagelsmann has been a manager for a clubs first team for longer than Enriques has.",Chelsea,Yes,jf1tp21,t1_jf174q1

"That's not true at all, some people on here who don't really have a connection with the club, maybe. 


But, there were plenty of people who still wished he'd been kept on even whilst we were having the success with Tuchel. 



I personally was more than happy to keep him when we got rid of him. Things feel right with him as our manager, he's as passionate about us as the most passionate fan and he feels everything we feel and fights with everything he's got. 



In a football climate that is so rotten with greed, people only interested in monetising everything and football teams that have worked on the bases of breaking even for the past 100 years being turned into businesses, there is something that feels so right about having a manager that might not be the best in the world but is as in love with the club as any fan is",Chelsea,Yes,jf3uri4,t1_jf3oajk
Not on Frank. I will always have faith in him to turn things around,Chelsea,Yes,jf3ulg2,t1_jf3oajk
"I‚Äôve seen outrage that he‚Äôs back because he‚Äôs seen as a step backwards, even from Potter",Chelsea,Yes,jf3z4yy,t1_jf3ylod
"agreed with less than 10 games left this season & a UCL tie with Real Madrid, doesnt sound bad at all.",Chelsea,Yes,jf3z0z7,t1_jf3ylod
Both are good coaches and have tactics. What matters is how they manage their relationship with the players and the boards,Chelsea,Yes,jf47y49,t1_jf44i7i
We have the same issues because we have the same players. No coach will change our goal-scoring draught.,Chelsea,Yes,jf1bmi4,t1_jf1ax01
"Zidane is not interested in developing young players, this is why he's jobless for 2 years. His success is by keeping Ronaldo happy.",Chelsea,Yes,jf1ck3r,t1_jf1ax01
Gallardo is my dark horse pick as well,Chelsea,Yes,jf3lxxb,t1_jf2j9xa
I would be lying if i said that i am not excited to see lampard on the touchline for us again tbh,Chelsea,Yes,jf32hfj,t1_jf324fm
"Well we are always in dire straits when the coach gets fired, no matter who üòÇ",Chelsea,Yes,jf3ij08,t1_jf3fwyj
"It‚Äôs a good thing then that Frank is only an interim manager then. Enjoy the ride, a bigger legend doesn‚Äôt exist for the club",Chelsea,Yes,jf3mdaj,t1_jf3fwyj
"He is still better at finishing than most of our attackers, just play 4-3-3 and enjoy",Chelsea,Yes,jf4csig,t1_jf4cdw2
"Pulisic is a false footballer.

Why you'd want to play statistically the worst finisher in the squad at number 9 when he hasn't been able to buy a goal or assist his entire career when we have Auba at the club is beyond me

Pulisic should have played his last game for the club in any position let alone striker.",Chelsea,Yes,jf4jzbq,t1_jf4cdw2
"That‚Äôs a good point.  Anyone who is unhappy with this appointment is either being contrarian for the sake of it, or just being dumb",Chelsea,Yes,jf3d9bq,t1_jf3cz0a
We are still in the champions league. Lampard has managed this team and many of these players. He is uniquely capable to pick up as manager and hit the ground running.,Chelsea,Yes,jf460tp,t1_jf3pori
"In Offense.

4/5 of their main defense started tonight, only Christensen was missing.",Chelsea,Yes,jf3tg8t,t1_jf3ptnb
Shame Broja got injured.,Chelsea,Yes,jf1bth2,t1_jf17961
He's still missing sitters. He's not going to magically curl the ball into top corner must because he plays slightly behind all. He's still a forward. Forwards need to score.,Chelsea,Yes,jf16t52,t1_jf16jih
"Tbf a lot of the spending in the summer was replacing those we lost in the summer of 22. And a lot of the spending like Nkunku, Gusto, Santos et al. hasn't featured yet - while players like Mudryk, Badiashile, Madueke has been brought for the future - not necessarily for immediate impact.",Chelsea,Yes,jf19ljl,t1_jf19348
I know that's my point. We're signing another winger/second striker,Chelsea,Yes,jf1ch8g,t1_jf1b8xo
I was hard JN. But starting to think the players want someone that‚Äôll put them in their place. And that‚Äôs Enrique. The guy managed MSN and Xavi and Iniesta all in the same team. Big egos right there,Chelsea,Yes,jf2ok0l,t1_jf2kn8y
Will definitely give it a listen :),Chelsea,Yes,jf4za57,t1_jf4ijjg
Won more trophies than potter and Nagelsmann. How can you say he‚Äôs nowhere near experienced? He developed Julian and Enzo.,Chelsea,Yes,jf5dx41,t1_jf4bs9v
"honestly, the Ziyech hand outs after his failed transfer sent me.",Chelsea,Yes,jf136ju,t1_jf12k8u
Have you seen Enrique on the sidelines? He‚Äôs as animated as it gets,Chelsea,Yes,jf0z2po,t1_jf0ysx1
What do you make of his club record?,Chelsea,Yes,jf0z5ul,t1_jf0ysx1
"I don't consider Havertz as a young player any more. He's almost played 7 full seasons of Bundesliga and Premier League football. He's a very experienced player.

I'm a huge fan of Havertz, but even I'm doubting him now. You just can't rely on him to produce.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0ssvu,t1_jf0s84c
"Are you joking? Felix the epitome of a what if player, he can‚Äôt score for shit",Chelsea,Yes,jf1dgi0,t1_jf16hrn
He averages 0.08 xA/90. Less than Badiashile. He cannot do anything apart from flicks and dribbling into opponents.,Chelsea,Yes,jf16v44,t1_jf16hrn
He is not performing. Face the reality mate,Chelsea,Yes,jf17l48,t1_jf16hrn
"its anthony taylor.

a chelsea player could be dismembered infront of him and he'd get booked for diving.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0zom3,t1_jf0xs0m
Red card is a huge over exaggeration,Chelsea,Yes,jf13ez0,t1_jf0xs0m
What is Felix creating? He prefers to shoot than make the final pass,Chelsea,Yes,jf159oe,t1_jf154ci
Felix is statistically one of the worst creators in the PL this season,Chelsea,Yes,jf159l3,t1_jf154ci
He will get it when he goes to Tottenham,Chelsea,Yes,jf3zuur,t1_jf3qneg
A striker who's so shit at shooting ? I can't..,Chelsea,Yes,jf1od5h,t1_jf1fyry
If we want Nagelsmann and he wants to wait till the summer then Lamps coming in won‚Äôt be the worst idea. At least we‚Äôll start scoring again and that‚Äôs is a huge improvement from Potterball that Bruno seems to want to keep playing. Besides we will also stop alienating Mount which at this rate we‚Äôre just pushing him to the door.,Chelsea,No,jf24wnb,t1_jf21t34
It‚Äôs been documented that there is a unrest with Bruno commanding until the end of the season. On top of that nagelsmann has been rumored to want to take a break until the summer. If these are both true I don‚Äôt see how Lampard as a caretaker would be bad. I don‚Äôt get how you see Frank turning this possible caretaker into a permanent role. Boehly and co would be stupid to hire him permanent especially after this potter saga,Chelsea,No,jf2gm0v,t1_jf21t34
He was pretty close to it under Lampard and during project restart,Chelsea,Yes,jf2wfit,t1_jf2uulh
"I'm actually agree with all of your points. But, it would piss me if Mount leaves.",Chelsea,Yes,jf1h6fd,t1_jf0u816
Kova was dreadful. Consistently gave the ball away and looked like he had no idea what he was doing.,Chelsea,Yes,jf1li25,t1_jf133xe
"As long as it's not dull Graham it's a positive step.

Graham should have been sacked months ago the fact we gave him so much more time than he deserved was embarrassing.",Chelsea,Yes,jf3115n,t1_jf2zo8z
"That's the point. The propaganda the club was pumping out through newspapers/journalists all maintained that up until his sacking he was the most popular manager ever. That all of the players really respected him and it was an incredible show of just how good of a manager he is that even in this horrible run all of the players looked up to him and believed in him etc. etc.



Some of us called it out as bullshit PR and were told we were idiots. Then he got fired and almost none of the players thanked him for his time here, showing that it was complete bullshit and they were happy he was finally gone",Chelsea,Yes,jf63vi5,t1_jf62dfm
"Yeah I'm not holding out hope and he brings a lot of other needed attributes from the wingback/fullback position, but I feel like if you give reece 3 or 4 shots that he'd probably get every game at striker he's guaranteed to score at least one.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0o0oi,t1_jf0nq10
He kinda does tho‚Ä¶,Chelsea,Yes,jf0mzw1,t1_jf0md3f
"Last time I checked first touch and striking/passing the ball were important technical skills.

His first touch is usually flawless whether in the air or on the ground. He's clearly the best at striking the ball on the team whether it's in the air or ground and whether it's a pass or shot. Can hit any pass he needs to. He's a solid dribbler but not the best on the team in that aspect obviously.

Don't know why you think it's that funny. Have you seen the rest of our team, especially positions that require the most technical skill, trying to do some of the basic components of technical skill?

Edit: Enzo is about the only one I'd maybe put ahead of him when you consider everything. Some other players have an argument for being ahead of him, but it's close.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0moaf,t1_jf0md3f
"Gallardo. 

He had to reinvent his side constantly and developed some of the most exciting players in the world including Enzo",Chelsea,Yes,jf1tnix,t1_jf1rbnp
Ancelotti fits,Chelsea,Yes,jf1s9j0,t1_jf1rbnp
"Ancelotti or Zidane. It's clear the players didn't respect Potter and I don't think bringing in a 35 year old manager in the same progressive vein as Potter is a solution. I don't mind Enrique as much but still think we can do a lot better. Zidane has gravitas, is an imposing figure and all the players look up to him, Ancelotti's record speaks for itself. Would much rather wait for one of those 2, but it's really on them if they want to come here or not.",Chelsea,Yes,jf1uouf,t1_jf1rbnp
"Problem is I see PSG and Real Madrid getting rid of their managers.

Ancelotti I don't see coming back to us, and Galtier ain't it. That's 2 big clubs we'd be competing with for managers. Enrique feels like he'd do well at PSG, and who says no when Madrid offers you a job?

Then what? Just pray someone comes available over the summer?",Chelsea,Yes,jf265n2,t1_jf24oha
"River Plate is a big club, I will not stand Libertadores slander. And before we saved his job by taking Felix I would‚Äôve said Simeone",Chelsea,Yes,jf1teda,t1_jf1sp09
No way you‚Äôre comparing Felix‚Äôs in-game intelligence to Kovacic‚Äôs. Kovacic may be bad with end product but his intelligence in the middle of the park is absolutely top notch,Chelsea,Yes,jf0rnns,t1_jf0rbbl
"Already humiliated, 600 Million and stuck at 11th, hope we recover nxt season",Chelsea,Yes,jf5geof,t1_jf58fz6
"Is there anyone in particular you want?

"Great, so where are the goals coming from?

Or are we going back to the dizzy heights of 7 goals from Jorgi being our season top. Really going to compete with the City/Haaland form isn't it.

Be realistic, yes we're better than where we are in the table, I'm not suggesting otherwise, but we're not solving this without a striker.",Chelsea,Yes,jf11xw1,t1_jf10mh0
"The competition is significantly better this season and will only improve in the next one with Newcastle getting CL football, Man Utd likely being sold to Qatar, and Arsenal getting CL football...",Chelsea,Yes,jf12fug,t1_jf10mh0
"I cannot think they'd be this dense, but the hierarchy seems to be treating the players thus far like teams do in American sports as far as transfers are concerned (where there is significantly less importance in player opinion both in the decision-making and media importance), and I really hope that's not the case.",Chelsea,Yes,jf22dy6,t1_jf20ldy
Nothing this season is gonna stick to whoever gets the last games though.,Chelsea,Yes,jf3el7k,t1_jf3dp36
"Think that line only makes sense if Bruno said he's done. I agree it's good they are doing due diligence, but you don't bring in Lampard if your targets are willing to come in now. Enrique seemed willing, Nagelsmann didn't",Chelsea,Yes,jf3evrf,t1_jf3d4kt
Haha. My comment aged like milk.,Chelsea,Yes,jf3ir7u,t1_jf3i5up
"It has to be this. I‚Äôll be surprised if Frank doesn‚Äôt start Mount on his first game back, and Sterling is our best forward (has been better than Joao Felix for sure)",Chelsea,Yes,jf3mw6f,t1_jf3hxfr
Thays good to hear but I'm just a bit scared. What if PSG just throws everything at him lol,Chelsea,Yes,jf5o64g,t1_jf5b41e
He wants to manage Brazil,Chelsea,Yes,jf6488f,t1_jf5o9ra
You mean clueless and incompetent,Chelsea,Yes,jf0psyk,t1_jf0ogcq
You want to blame Abramovich for the players he bought and then cite Aubameyang as an example? Which owner decided on that one lad?,Chelsea,Yes,jf0rv0x,t1_jf0qkmx
"In this case it makes way more sense.

Do you say you make 50k a year or 961 dollars a week?",Chelsea,Yes,jf0wnt0,t1_jf0vztf
"That makes sense, after doing some math. It‚Äôs pretty wild how underpaid some players are compared to the pay in American leagues.

150k a week is 7.8 mil a year
 
KDB is the highest paid player in the EPL at 20.8 mil a year. 9 players in the NBA 1.5X his salary. 10 players in the NFL double his salary.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0x0gq,t1_jf0tel4
He has been our most potent attacking thread in all the games he played ( chilwell against villa but we scored 0). The amount of times that guy hit the post is baffling. On a slightly luckier day they go in and you all will sing praises. This has been absolute shit season. Based on that everyone needs to go,Chelsea,Yes,jf0vxpc,t1_jf0rwzn
"Kova can‚Äôt finish. But what he brings in the midfield is essential (although Kante did all that in his first game back and more). His ability to turn over the possession and quickly beat his man and move on is absolutely great. 

About felix, he‚Äôs the trump card. Of all the times that guy hits the post, I am sure you‚Äôd have a better opinion of him if few went in. Every team needs that magic, and we have no one who does this better than him. Pulisic looses ball almost everytime. Mudryk and madueke haven‚Äôt played enough for me to form an opinion. Mount is freezed out. Gallagher needs to go.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0q3k4,t1_jf0pi4q
"Your agenda against the same players for years on end is so boring. Apart from the missed chances (one of which was an excellent recovery by Konate), Kovacic was excellent yesterday.

>We have two young midfielders who have proven better than him this season but they aren‚Äôt expensive transfers so they can‚Äôt play

Genuinely have no idea who you could be referring to. I'm assuming one of them is Gallagher, which in itself is an absolutely mental take, but can't even figure out who else you might be talking about. Hall? Chukwuemeka? If so, please get your head checked.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0yioo,t1_jf0r6ar
"Yeah that season Man City was their weakest in recent times(almost every club was in transition apart from Liverpool). The only real good game we had under him was the Liverpool game after restart. 

If Lampard was really that good as everyone is making it to be we wouldn't have been 10 next season with 200m+ additions to the squad. That period was the worst I've ever seen us defend in the last 10-12 years.",Chelsea,Yes,jf387vq,t1_jf37fbb
"Looking at his last some 15-20 games I would press X to doubt

Lampard will bring the back 4 and we all know how good his defensive organisation is",Chelsea,Yes,jf36y60,t1_jf35p2k
"We did, like I mention in the other comment, we completely didn't bother to put more pressure on Liverpool in the 2nd half when we could and put on some subs to back that up. Only did that for last 10 minutes, which is way too late.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0ugj3,t1_jf0u89d
"We didn't bother to put in more firepower on the pitch until last 10 minutes, even though the game was asking for it. Not to mention we played with only 2 forwards the whole game.

When you are the side with initiative, the side who takes more shots, creates more chances and is more of a threat and you don't back that up with offensive subs, you are playing for a draw in my books.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0u3ed,t1_jf0tz5x
Tryna see who‚Äôll pick 2 so I know who‚Äôs plastic in this sub,Chelsea,Yes,jf4lwv0,t1_jf4jud8
Maybe true but he did better than anyone at Spurs in 50 years. I think it is dumb to not rate a manager because he was at a rival club,Chelsea,Yes,jf20gha,t1_jf200ik
"I think getting 86 points and finishing 2nd at Spurs is a big an achievement as what Nagelsman has done. And Enrique is undoubtedly a good coach but had top 5 player in their position all over the pitch, we maybe have 2-3 of those type guys, I think getting a builder manager for 3-4 then getting our tactical genius when the squad is more refined is best course for the club long term.",Chelsea,Yes,jf21rf7,t1_jf1yol3
"Na, not with experienced manager like Tuchel",Chelsea,Yes,jf3g326,t1_jf3dfgj
"You only have to look at the positivity Pulisic gets and how heavily upvoted it usually is.

He's indisputably one of the worst signings in the clubs history but 40% of the sub will throw every other player and every manager he's ever had under the bus to argue otherwise. 

Will be interesting the dynamic changes when he leaves",Chelsea,Yes,jf29bds,t1_jf28p33
Thank you!,Chelsea,Yes,jf2ftwh,t1_jf21w8c
Nagelsmann > Enrique >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Poch>>Potter.,Chelsea,Yes,jf32hka,t1_jf32au1
"Sorry I should clarify, I mean a former player AND manager coming back to the same club they managed and played at.",Chelsea,Yes,jf49iqd,t1_jf48s1x
"Of course we could beat them. The only reason we have any champions leagues is because of the exact opposite attitude to that. 

My point is that Lampard is going to switch to 433 3 days before our biggest game of the season and I don‚Äôt see how that could be a good thing right now.",Chelsea,Yes,jf66nco,t1_jf62xx3
Potter works well with mid-table teams. He absolutely would save Villa from relegation.,Chelsea,Yes,jf1uqyx,t1_jf1sy4j
Honestly thought Potter was in the dugout today,Chelsea,Yes,jf0vwrt,t1_jf0qml2
Asking a question because it‚Äôs likely something idiotic.,Chelsea,Yes,jf0zn64,t1_jf0z9l7
"I think its got to do with the fact that they apparently want to do their due diligence and not rush into an appointment.   
Doesnt explain why hire Lampard but thats another question",Chelsea,Yes,jf4fdps,t1_jf44sgz
"Yeah I agree, nothing to complain about there. Having kante back helps, but in terms of a lot of the poor games prior to this, it has looked a lot more leaky as opposed to world class when were at our best under tuchel. Our attack still struggled a good amount at times back then, but it didn't matter nearly as much with what was playing behind the attack.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0qm1i,t1_jf0q8s1
"16/17: 67pts and 2nd in their 1st top flight season

18/19: 66pts and 3rd

Nagelsmann‚Äôs point totals are 66 and 65 before leaving for Bayern and the squads were adding experience as time went on. 

Outside of Hoffenheim I think he has inherited well managed teams and been able to produce very high level football at times but at cost of consistency.",Chelsea,Yes,jf2in5w,t1_jf2h8lm
Because he has played like an hour,Chelsea,Yes,jf109ct,t1_jf0zfta
"He is not that terrible. He has that drive, strength, pace. Since Havertz, Felix combo isn't working much, no harm in trying.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0ws07,t1_jf0w22k
He‚Äôs not terrible. He almost scored against Fulham in his brief cameo if not for a goal line clearance.,Chelsea,Yes,jf16nw6,t1_jf0w22k
Thats why im saying i dunno what to think,Chelsea,Yes,jf182t8,t1_jf17ozr
He's been proven to know nothing,Chelsea,Yes,jf1roue,t1_jf1n8ww
If this was a Spurs fan talking about Tim Sherwood you lot would all be laughing at how pathetic they sounded.,Chelsea,Yes,jf3z217,t1_jf3uri4
"For real. Even if Frank had somehow gotten us in the position that Potter had us in, I would have still supported him. That being said, he got better results with a worse squad.",Chelsea,Yes,jf3yupu,t1_jf3uri4
"Yep. Also would love to see Lampard actually offered a chance to have more control in bringing in targets. In 2019 obviously we were transfer banned and then in 2020 the only player of the 5 we signed (Mendy sort of too because Lampard wanted a keeper even if he didn't choose him) that was Lampard's choice that he pushed for was Chillwell. Out of Havertz, Timo, Ziyech, Mendy, and Chillwell only 1 has been an absolute success.",Chelsea,Yes,jf45r8f,t1_jf3uri4
"I wanted Lampard to stay for similar reasons but this fanbase can be bad sometimes due to the sacking culture. 

I guess I didn't want him sacked the first time but I wasn't surprised they sacked him at that point. In general he seems to care about the club and generally made the right decisions.",Chelsea,Yes,jf5y8sb,t1_jf3uri4
"Be is a step back though. His appointment makes 0 sporting sense, the only way I can rationalise this is the owners‚Äô pathetic attempt to calm down the fanbase.",Chelsea,Yes,jf45hqn,t1_jf3z4yy
I think he‚Äôs the best combination of rebuild manager like Poch and Simeone and the revelutionary that Nagelsman and Enrique at touted to be. But I think Chelsea would have to use the time between now and June to get him prepared the the English/European game to get the best of him.,Chelsea,Yes,jf3o4e5,t1_jf3lxxb
Carlo? Avram?,Chelsea,Yes,jf3ivd1,t1_jf3ij08
"It‚Äôs true, I wouldn‚Äôt be upset if he started, just wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he doesn‚Äôt. Just don‚Äôt want to see havertz up top",Chelsea,Yes,jf4kuqx,t1_jf4csig
"Pulisic overperforms his xG but don‚Äôt let facts and reality get in the way of your little rant. Not going to check everyone but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Pulisic isn‚Äôt up there with our best statistical finishers. Says a lot about our squad though
https://understat.com/player/2662",Chelsea,Yes,jf4le9g,t1_jf4jzbq
"We already have Ziyech, CHO probably Pulisic and Havertz leaving already.",Chelsea,Yes,jf1ivil,t1_jf1ch8g
Yea super odd to think that Thiago Silva will be older in the dressing room than JN,Chelsea,Yes,jf2owt5,t1_jf2ok0l
Agree plus his tactics and profile really fit Chelsea - I wouldnt be mad with either appointment tbh Enrique could be a great manager for us.,Chelsea,Yes,jf32ta4,t1_jf2ok0l
From Ireland so sometimes you have to fast forward the Gaelic sports section. But they do a free football pod every week. They are entertaining and give a really round view of each club with no biases. Enjoy,Chelsea,Yes,jf5z1w4,t1_jf4za57
It showed to me that Potter had no authority in the dressing room. Should have been sacked after this,Chelsea,Yes,jf13a7a,t1_jf136ju
"1 thing I will address, is how people on here were saying he managed Barca when they had MSN so didn't really need to do much etc. Whilst that would certainly help him, he's also seen what these elite level players do day in / day out to stay elite and that's invaluable experience he could bring to us. As much as Messi is obviously extremely gifted, he still would've had to have put in the hours/ hard work on the training ground to stay elite and Enrique and his team will have helped with that. His record with Barca wasn't the best, but they still won using his formations and tactics and his experience is / will be a huge asset, especially compared to someone like Potter who worked with Maupay, Trossard and Welbeck, which whilst they have their ""days"", that's not quite MSN.",Chelsea,Yes,jf1emzc,t1_jf0z5ul
"And who exactly can we rely on to produce though, young or old? The Havertz scapegoat train genuinely baffles me

If we get to a point where our other forwards are clearly outperforming him, then we should bin him right away, he‚Äôs had his time. But until then, I don‚Äôt think replacing or even benching him will solve anything at all. Skepticism is important and I wouldn‚Äôt advocate for blind confidence in him either, but I‚Äôll never tire of restating that he‚Äôs not one of our bigger problems until there‚Äôs actual good evidence of it",Chelsea,Yes,jf0t8vd,t1_jf0ssvu
"On any other day, with any other ref, Jaoa could have easily got a couple of more LFC players on bookings or even off. Not sure about this dribbling into players when he's small enough and often gets through.",Chelsea,Yes,jf176j0,t1_jf16v44
"He was never close to world class. He played very well for a couple of months, end of.",Chelsea,Yes,jf2xz6r,t1_jf2wfit
"There‚Äôs a difference between being in good form and being world class. World class is De Bruyne and Salah, good form is Rashford",Chelsea,Yes,jf2y2fw,t1_jf2wfit
Me too,Chelsea,Yes,jf1l4i6,t1_jf1h6fd
"That is usually what he does, and dribbling close to our own goal is the kova special

Usually it means that we bypass the press (75% of the time)",Chelsea,Yes,jf1mfp4,t1_jf1li25
There were some articles about his demands being too high or smthing,Chelsea,Yes,jf1trxj,t1_jf1tnix
"Don't think he would be interested in Chelsea, he would be interested in taking Brazil NT

Never say never, but I just don't see it happening",Chelsea,Yes,jf1sfti,t1_jf1s9j0
"Ancelotti‚Äôs tactics are a very poor fit for our squad, he wouldn‚Äôt be in it for the long term, and he seems headed to Brazil. Zidane won‚Äôt come here, I have no idea why people mention his name so much.",Chelsea,Yes,jf23e0v,t1_jf1uouf
"Fortunately there are way more than 2 quality managers in world football. 


We don't have to pray that someone becomes available, we are Chelsea. Everyone that isn't currently at a top 3 PL, top 2 LaLiga, top 1 Bundesliga/Ligue 1 team is available to us.",Chelsea,Yes,jf27zjy,t1_jf265n2
True. I meant his game intelligence didn't improve in the last 4 years.,Chelsea,Yes,jf0rqll,t1_jf0rnns
"No, I don't believe that you're in a position to judge a manager unless you've watched them a decent amount whilst understanding the quality of the team that he has available to him. 



Having watched Spain at the World Cup, I have reservations about Enrique. I have reservations about all of the options though and would like the sporting team to be given as much time as is possible, all the way to summer if necessary, to pick the right manager. Not just one of the two that are easily available at the moment.",Chelsea,Yes,jf29w6s,t1_jf283of
"Bra Enrique has been free for 3 months. He had plenty of time to research prem team. Nagelsmann just got sacked like 2 weeks ago. 

Chelsea is a huge job for any manager and he likely has to prepare for all the other interviews as well. You‚Äôre trying to find bones in an egg.",Chelsea,Yes,jf1yato,t1_jf1xrk4
hindsight is 20/20,Chelsea,Yes,jf25c5g,t1_jf1biy5
"Sure teams have improved, others have fallen off, though. Newcastle and Arsenal have essentially taken over ours and Liverpool‚Äôs spots due to a dreadful season from both of us. You can‚Äôt look at Newcastle‚Äôs current team and say ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs a better squad than Chelsea have got‚Äù. Half of their starting XI were memes before Eddie Howe took over and improved them massively.",Chelsea,Yes,jf15eao,t1_jf12fug
"Which is exactly why there's no point bringing in a permanent manager. Let them have a completely clean slate in the summer, give them time to do some preparations in the background, work with the recruitment team and plan for next season while Lampard takes care of seeing out the remainder of the dead-rubber games. No reason to introduce them to any negativity before they've had a chance to do anything differently",Chelsea,Yes,jf3g9jr,t1_jf3el7k
(Roman and tuchel),Chelsea,Yes,jf0xky1,t1_jf0rv0x
"actually where im at right now, the norm here is ""i earn X amount a month""",Chelsea,Yes,jf0xlxt,t1_jf0wnt0
I think it‚Äôs just a difference in culture. I‚Äôm from the UK and I say my wage in months.,Chelsea,Yes,jf0z6xj,t1_jf0wnt0
"Yeah, NFL generates more money than football. I think part of it is due to how commercialised the sport is. Part of it is the fact that the format of the sport (longer games, many breaks in play) is just better suited to making money than football is (short games, only 1 break at HT). 

The former, I think many owners are trying to introduce to football, the latter can never be changed, so I suppose NFL salaries will always be higher than football salaries.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0yaz8,t1_jf0x0gq
Also American football and basketball dominate the world market for those sports with few other options to watch. European football has many leagues and options to watch so the money is more spread out.,Chelsea,Yes,jf12pwc,t1_jf0x0gq
He‚Äôs a flashy what-if player with zero end product imo. He‚Äôs got potential if he works on his finishing and selflessness but to call him a world class player already is just plain ignorance,Chelsea,Yes,jf0x8yi,t1_jf0vxpc
"I‚Äôd be ok with selling Kova. I know we‚Äôve been rumored with Kone, Caicedo, and Lavia. And the rumor has been 2 MF, not just 1. 

.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0qtic,t1_jf0q3k4
How does Bruno's record look?,Chelsea,Yes,jf39jxw,t1_jf36y60
"I don't disagree, but that's just what the situation is sadly. I'd be okay with Poch as the third choice if Enrique or Nagelsmann say no, but there will be basically no room for error for Poch",Chelsea,Yes,jf21kzi,t1_jf20gha
"Nah. Nagelsmann took over a relegation fodder in Hoffenheim mid-season, kept them up, and then finished top4 in both of his full seasons with them. They had never in their history qualified for Europe prior to that. I think that‚Äôs more impressive than finishing 2nd with Spurs.",Chelsea,Yes,jf22qoc,t1_jf21rf7
"Don‚Äôt underestimate our current squad. Reece and Chilwell are both well in the convo for top 5 RB and LB. There‚Äôs a reason we paid so much for Enzo and he is one of the most promising young midfielders. Kovacic has shown time and time again that he‚Äôs one of the best current progressives of the ball. Kante is Kante. Add to that how promising Fofana and Badi look and we are a front 3 and GK away from a super team. We need someone with the tactile for sight to build these incredibly talented players into a system that works, we don‚Äôt need another rebuild.",Chelsea,Yes,jf22rzp,t1_jf21rf7
Liverpool brought back Dalglish as an interim back in 2011-2012.,Chelsea,Yes,jf49vcy,t1_jf49iqd
"A few come to mind:

Heynckes at Borussia M√∂nchengladbach. (He also managed Bayern on 4 separate occasions but didn't play for them.)

Kevin Keegan at Newcastle.

Kenny Dalglish at Liverpool.",Chelsea,Yes,jf4atcp,t1_jf49iqd
"Potter won 28% of his league games at Brighton with a talented squad and never won a domestic cup game against PL opposition.

He won less than a third of his league games here and needs  multiple seasons to do anything, he nearly took Brighton down twice in his first 2 full seasons.

Coming into a Villa side in 17th and falling? He'd have relegated them.",Chelsea,Yes,jf1uy6a,t1_jf1uqyx
Saving them from relegation isn't bringing them to 7th,Chelsea,Yes,jfbu5gt,t1_jf1uqyx
"Sure then his Leipzig side is at worst on par with the best of Hussenhuttle and Rangnick.

I agree he inherited a good Leipzig side. But he also took them to the CL semis. Your original comment made it sound like he underperformed at Leipzig",Chelsea,Yes,jf2mh5x,t1_jf2in5w
Yup I already mentioned that,Chelsea,Yes,jf10mqk,t1_jf109ct
Yeah because Tim Sherwood as a Spurs legend is clearly similar to Lampard as a Chelsea legend,Chelsea,Yes,jf4199p,t1_jf3z217
Why does it make 0 sense? Sometimes leadership groups make decisions that have merit or seem to have merit and don‚Äôt make sense unless you‚Äôre in the group.,Chelsea,Yes,jf581xy,t1_jf45hqn
"and it worked, the masses are lapping it up",Chelsea,Yes,jf4ep4v,t1_jf45hqn
"Well Carlo was like 12 years ago but there should have been something that triggered the doing

But most coaches had dire straits when fired: Tuchel, Mourinho, Conte, Sarri, Lamps, Benitez, Scolari, AVB


With Avram it was weird",Chelsea,Yes,jf3jqqt,t1_jf3ivd1
"I would play 4-2-3-1

Kepa/Mendy

Chilly Fofana (or Badi) Kouli (good form and plays CL) James

Kante Fernandez

Felix Havertz Sterling

Aubameyang",Chelsea,Yes,jf4rdqm,t1_jf4kuqx
"Your source contradicts your very first statement. Furthermore, if we define the best statistical finishers as the top xG + xA per 90 combined, then Pulisic highest ranking (4th) in the squad came in 20/21, and has been 7th and 8th in 21/22 and 22/23 respectively.

One would expect him to be much higher, because since his physicality has been quite poor and he's been injured for so many games, his numbers should be higher (compared to others) if he makes many contributions in the games he does play. However, this is not the case.",Chelsea,Yes,jf4pq4k,t1_jf4le9g
"Lmao.

You do realise the stats you posted literally show that Pulisic under performs his XG and has pretty much every season of his career right? 

How can you find and post stats yet read them incorrectly and argue the opposite of what they show?

Genuinely how do people like you use reddit?",Chelsea,Yes,jf4m177,t1_jf4le9g
"It's one thing to want to move them all on, it's another actually doing so",Chelsea,Yes,jf1wv0r,t1_jf1ivil
"yep, big bitch move haha",Chelsea,Yes,jf16473,t1_jf13a7a
"Havertz scapegoat train?

If he wasn't missing 1v1 or tap-ins, then people wouldn't have cared.

He has stayed 3 seasons here and he is part of the reason for this clubs mediocrity.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0txdw,t1_jf0t8vd
"I just think he's probably had enough time, man. That's all.

He's good player but he hasn't progressed since he's been here. He just hasn't offered enough, and I don't know how long we can wait.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0vmj7,t1_jf0t8vd
Stop blaming refs and open your eyes. LESS EXPECTED ASSISTS THAN BADIASHILE,Chelsea,Yes,jf17gxe,t1_jf176j0
"They weren't with regards to us, that was from other teams. He basically wants to come to Europe and he's had plenty of offers from ""second class"" teams but those teams that are at a level that are willing to give him his chance can't afford his wage demands. We can easily afford them, they're less than what we were paying Potter",Chelsea,Yes,jf25ic8,t1_jf1trxj
"Given we‚Äôve spent 600 million and of that 250 on dross, I imagine we could afford it.",Chelsea,Yes,jf1w2p7,t1_jf1trxj
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true at all either though. He improved considerably from 18/19 and then again from 19/20 to 20/21. Then not so much since,Chelsea,Yes,jf0rzo9,t1_jf0rqll
"My worry is that no other suitable managers will pop up come summer time

Bar one‚Äôs out of left field like ange postecoglu etc",Chelsea,Yes,jf2asjz,t1_jf29w6s
Enrique also had existing links whilst Potter was still in charge so it‚Äôs no shock that he already has a plan,Chelsea,Yes,jf1yiy3,t1_jf1yato
"I think Nagelsmann is the better fit of manager and am supportive of him joining.

I also think him waiting a week before travelling to London is bullshit. It‚Äôs a 2 hour flight from Germany. He could be home the same day. 

It‚Äôs literally 2 months of work and he‚Äôs back on holiday when the season ends, and we‚Äôve Madrid in 8 days.",Chelsea,Yes,jf1z0td,t1_jf1yato
"Tuchel didn‚Äôt even get 90 minutes with him before getting sacked, so that‚Äôs even more stupid, congratulations",Chelsea,Yes,jf0z196,t1_jf0xky1
"That‚Äôs very interesting, also in the UK?",Chelsea,Yes,jf0yebw,t1_jf0xlxt
Also strange to me. Here in the US it‚Äôs either hourly or yearly,Chelsea,Yes,jf30n79,t1_jf0z6xj
"The highest paid players in the NFL make more than the highest paid players in the EPL, but there are huge salary disparities in the NFL.  As of 2019-20 (I couldn‚Äôt find a newer comprehensive list), the NBA had by far the highest average salaries of any professional sports league.  The IPL (that‚Äôs right, Indian cricket), was second.  Major League Baseball nosed out the EPL for their place, and the NFL was fifth.  Here‚Äôs the full list- https://www.statista.com/statistics/675120/average-sports-salaries-by-league/",Chelsea,Yes,jf2x3w3,t1_jf0yaz8
Well if you look at it he's undefeated so far,Chelsea,Yes,jf39oyd,t1_jf39jxw
I‚Äôm not as high on Enrique and Nagelsman as everyone else. I think if you swapped Poch with either of them at Barcelona or Bayern the results would be the same but I‚Äôm not sure they could take Spurs to 2nd with a net spend of 50m over 5 years like Poch did.,Chelsea,Yes,jf223gn,t1_jf21kzi
"But attackers are the most important and thats what we lack, Nkunku has a chance though. As a WB Chilwell is good but can be a passenger defensively in a 4. We have good midfield option but is we play out 3 best, Enzo Kante and Kova, we lack any real goal threat and don‚Äôt have a natural shield for the back line. Our squad is talented but doesn‚Äôt really fit together. Kante, Chilwell, Havertz, and Mount are all best suited for 3-4-2-1 while Benoit, Enzo, Mudryk, and Sterling are 4-3-3 players. Fofana and Reece can either system well but we need a manager who has a clears style of play who will consolidate the squad and is why I would rank the 3 Poch, Enrique, Nagelsman",Chelsea,Yes,jf24utv,t1_jf22rzp
"Nice, thanks. Guess it's not so unprecedented.",Chelsea,Yes,jf4q4s9,t1_jf4atcp
"Sorry about confusion, I don‚Äôt think he underperformed but merely maintained what they had going. I do think Bayern have regressed since his appointment. I think his last 2 jobs are quite similar to the Poch‚Äôs last 2, with Poch doing it a more difficult clubs.",Chelsea,Yes,jf2pyr2,t1_jf2mh5x
"Hey man, he almost scored against Fulham. I realise almost is a stupid argument to make, but he seems technically good and I think he should be given a chance. But he certainly will not be given a chance and the sample size is too small to trust him fully I guess",Chelsea,Yes,jf16eye,t1_jf10mqk
"Legacy at the club as a shouldn‚Äôt matter when determining if they should manage the team. Nothing against Lampard, loved him as a player, but if Boehly is serious about trying to build a team that will compete for titles, Lampard shouldn‚Äôt be offered the position as manager any time soon",Chelsea,Yes,jf6e3bj,t1_jf4199p
"I mean just looking at it objectively it‚Äôs pretty clear that this was done just so Boehly can win back the fans. Lampard since leaving Chelsea hasn‚Äôt seemed improved as a manager so in a sporting sense it makes no sense to bring him back. 

I don‚Äôt t really care about him coming back regardless since this season is already a write off anyway (unless Boehly for some reason ends up appointing him as manager for next season)",Chelsea,Yes,jf6cwsj,t1_jf581xy
Fair enough.,Chelsea,Yes,jf213a5,t1_jf1wv0r
"Some coaches just aren't a good fit for bigger clubs. I know that at AC Milan we hired Giampaolo from Sampdoria because he made them play beautiful football, but he had a weak personality and lacked the balls to stick to his system when it went wrong and bench players who didn't perform. Enrique or Nagelsmann do have a big club personality however",Chelsea,Yes,jf16ua2,t1_jf16473
You need to answer the question lol. We don‚Äôt have forwards better than Havertz,Chelsea,Yes,jf0wdqp,t1_jf0vmj7

If we can afford it doesn't mean we should splash out and overpay,Chelsea,Yes,jf3bp1m,t1_jf1w2p7
"Imo people are putting to much stock in manager's supposed availability. As has been shown by us supposedly looking at Napoli's manager whilst they're top of the league by some distance, whether someone has a job or not shouldn't be relevant to our manager search. We should be trying to get the right manager, not the easily attainable manager",Chelsea,Yes,jf2b5f4,t1_jf2asjz
"Would you rather Nagelsmann rush to Chelsea and bomb the interview because he didn‚Äôt have enough time to prepare? The board is not gonna rush decisions because that‚Äôs what they did with Potter.

Nagelsmann might if Hoffenheim is any indication but I get it,Chelsea,Yes,jf24im1,t1_jf223gn
"Bayern has an aging squad problem. They have the 3rd oldest average age in Bundesliga and Nagelsmann was hired to phase out the older generation gradually despite the lack of financial backings. Sabitzer's departure also left Kimmich/Goretzka with less coverage.

"Well, we don't know how Auba would fare because he's been frozen out. The club needs to protect the value of their assets, and I suspect that's why Auba isn't seeing the pitch over Havertz.

"Some truth to that for sure

You must have some sort of inkling on a manager you‚Äôd like to have here though?",Chelsea,Yes,jf2ba67,t1_jf2b5f4
"Hoffenheim was definitely impressive, but even then there was serious regression when guys like Gnabry and Sule went Bayern. The year they got 3rd they were only 4 pts off 5th. Poch finished 8 pts over Pep and 10 over Klopp in 16/17 and their marquee signing was Sissoko.",Chelsea,Yes,jf26ytc,t1_jf24im1
Felix is doing just as bad and Sterling is actually a pretty good player,Chelsea,Yes,jf0z2zm,t1_jf0wznl
"No, not at all. It's never something I've really thought about before this year. Under old ownership I just trusted them to pick the right manager and waited for the announcement. We'd be linked to everyone and then it'd turn out to be someone like Conte who has all the right attributes but isn't the biggest name out there. I'd hope that the same happens this time.


To judge a manager you need to have a good amount of knowledge of the team that they're managing and then also watch a lot of their games. I don't have that kind of knowledge of managers outside of the ones that have already managed us or some premier league/world cup managers and none of them immediately jump out to me",Chelsea,Yes,jf2dezi,t1_jf2ba67

"Sometimes in life, one needs luck to instigate a favourable butterfly effect.

After rewatching the game against Villa. I observed a lot of errors and ineptitudes both from a tactical and personnel perspectives. I will only be touching the most conspicuous ones though. I will begin with Potter. 

Potter: 

The decision to play begin a must-win game with only a recognized CB demonstrated to be the recipe for disaster. He should be old enough to know you don't set yourself up for failure in life. Also, there was no recognized width on the right wing for a larger chunk of the game. That was before Madueke and Kante came in. For the love of the beautiful game, Loftus-Cheek shouldn't be played anywhere close to the sidelines (pun intended). Also, why wait till after the second goal before you decide to have enough of him? Furthermore, why was there an emphasis to play more down the right (38%) than the left (29%) despite the obvious disadvantage? Why should the team be spamming in crosses when there's actually only one (languid) 6ft+ attacker who rarely positions for them? Chilwell only completed 2/16 crosses. That was a shit show. 

Emery showed Potter how to win games tactically.

 Defence:

Poor communication between, KK and Cucu; and an avoidable error from the latter to concede the first goal. KK's positional strength should also be scrutinized as he clearly played Watkins onside for a big chance earlier on. James' ability on the ball was effectively gatekept all game with the imposed responsibility. 

Wing-backs: Chilwell was okayish, but could have done better in advanced positions when on the ball. The other guy was disastrous. 0 clearance + blocks + interceptions + tackles. 0/3 dribbles success. 0 shot. Lost 6 out of 7 duels. 1/7 crosses completed. I'd rather play Mudryk instead. 

Midfield: Both guys and Kante's return were the reason I stayed on the game till the final whistle. They could use a lot with diagonal runs from the WBs and forwards. Kovacic needs to improve on his positioning and spatial awareness though, while getting a defensive midfielder for Enzo is already a pertinent platitude. 

Attack: MM had a home game to forget. Better decisions on those two first half occasions could have boosted his confidence and change the narratives around him. For now, I don't think he should be occupying a central position anytime soon. He would be better on the flank for 1v1 take-ons and off-the-ball movements from the wide channel into the central region. In such way, his defensive duties can also be enhanced. F√©lix on another hand should be sharing some positional rotation with Chilwell down the left which is reminiscent of Hudson-Odoi during early last season. Also, I didn't see much of his off-the-ball movements. Despite been in the club for almost 3 years, Havertz is yet to show any stretch of consistency. His poor pressing eventually led to the first goal. Lost possession 12 times and half of his duels. He hasn't been excellent in dribbling, heading, hassling, creating, shooting or passing. Someone should tell me why he should be at the club next season. In conclusion, all the front three players need a focal point, a CF who can help them with some physicality. Someone robust enough to win duels against defender, penalties and free-kicks in dangerous positions. A typical striker. 

For what it's worth, I hope there's someone out there that might want to change my view.",Chelsea,No,jexymvl,t3_12b9hkv

"Sterling is robbing Chelsea. Bring in a goal scorer, play Joao and Havertz behind and 9 and let that 3 build over the next few years. Goals would rain in. Havertz hate continues to be unnecessary.",Chelsea,No,jez9ee9,t3_12b9hkv
"Been wondering why Simeone haven‚Äôt been brought up at all. Imo he‚Äôs top 3/5 managers in the world, extremely capable of building a team, and most importantly (someone that I don‚Äôt particularly see in Nagelsmann) has a toughness and mentality to him that is shared among our successful managers. Think of Tuchel, Mou, Conte. They were all extremely tough mangers as opposed to say Potter or Sarri‚Äôs more nice guy acts. Plus, the club has been pining for that elusive ‚Äúattacking football‚Äù but most of our trophy are won of the back of a strong foundational defense and it is as much of a tactical identity to Chelsea as anything and who better to return to those fundamentals than the best defensive coach in the world. I really hope we can somehow wait for him to come in during the summer.",Chelsea,No,jevxrgi,t3_12b9hkv
What are your thoughts on zidane? I think we should absolutely go for him,Chelsea,No,jew4r6z,t3_12b9hkv

Zidane - will never come

Considering it‚Äôs been just under 48 hours and we haven‚Äôt made a new appointment it‚Äôs becoming pretty clear we sacked potter without a plan which I don‚Äôt even understand how that‚Äôs possible,Chelsea,No,jevzokw,t3_12b9hkv
"Good day everyone.

What are your thoughts on H√∏jlund, Hjulmand and Facundo Torres?

I believe one of the players to consider for the CF role next season is Rasmus H√∏jlund. A powerful, strong and robust left-footed 20 yr old Scandinavian striker could be available at a < 50M bargain. A blend of Vlahovic and Haaland. Need some refinement though. 

Also for the DM role, I reckon Leece's Morten Hjulmand should also be watched. He will be 24 next season. Of course this should be upon the inability to get Rice or Ugarte.

For F. Torres, he will be coming as a 23 yr old inverted right-winger who could still join the likes of Chukwuemeka and Madueke. He could still go on loan though. Not so keen on him especially if Madueke plays well for the rest of the season.",Chelsea,No,jewesxs,t3_12b9hkv
So will we win against klopp?,Chelsea,No,jewkv1q,t3_12b9hkv

"28 games played and -1 gd boys, this season is one to forget",Chelsea,No,jeybuw9,t3_12b9hkv

"Welp with the game over, back we go to focusing our energy on the new manager.

Would be ideal if we brought him in prior to the Wolves game",Chelsea,No,jeyyy2o,t3_12b9hkv
"I saw the lineup and immediately the thought came to my mind was this is what potter might have picked. 

Sick of seeing the same players getting the same treatment. Why not Badia or why again kai as striker? Why always bring the same set of players in subs? 

But who is to blame for such pathetic decision making from the players? We saw how kova couldn't even land a shot 2-3 timws against Villa. At keast make the shot near the target. Chillwell, Felix, Mudryk, Kai all seemed to have forgotten how to take a proper shot, when to shoot. Reece has completely stopped shooting! 

I mean I am pretty dumb regarding management but Bruna could have done anything except what Potter does.",Chelsea,No,jf1413f,t3_12b9hkv
I know this would take work by the Mods and they don‚Äôt like that but it‚Äôs time for a Next Manager Mega Thread.,Chelsea,No,jf1egsq,t3_12b9hkv
"As much as the story of Lampard returning as interim manager is likely bullshit, I am not totally against the idea. We are only playing for the Champions League now and it‚Äôs far too late in the season for a new manager to implement their tactics and style of play. 

If we are to progress in the Champions League, we will need to rely on the squad being motivated and what better person to be in charge; a Chelsea legend and someone who has been through the same situation as the Chelsea players are going through now. A team that is struggling in the league, been through 2 managers in one season and with only the Champions League to play for.",Chelsea,No,jf1ggoi,t3_12b9hkv
I can‚Äôt believe people want Enrique over Nagelsmann. He hasn‚Äôt managed at the club level in 6 years! That‚Äôs an eternity in this world.,Chelsea,No,jf1mmhn,t3_12b9hkv
God Didn‚Äôt think Graham would screw up this bad.,Chelsea,Yes,jevxbt2,t1_jevutwb
Someone said he's on his Forrest Gump run and that's pretty accurate. There's managers that spend years working hoping to one day manage a club like Chelsea in the Prem and then theres Bruno with majestic bald head [like](https://twitter.com/TheBlueDodger/status/1642952176891731974?t=ZSiPJXqs6Zf0YfA407-KcA&s=19),Chelsea,Yes,jew9bo9,t1_jevutwb

"Dont want him either, seen enough

Guy is frustrating as hell and we have enough of these frustrating players",Chelsea,Yes,jezvynp,t1_jezo52s
We are the only club who can make a decision like signing Felix while already having Kai and Nkunku. Other clubs wouldn't even think about it. It looks like the board just wants young talent irrespective of whether they'll fit us or not. Kinda like young galacticos. I'm tired of them buying absolutely useless players,Chelsea,Yes,jf0abyy,t1_jezo52s
"Agreed, we need to spend that money on a real striker",Chelsea,Yes,jf1mtka,t1_jezo52s
"That‚Äôs what hurts most about this season - if we were even slightly better than putrid dogshit we could‚Äôve easily been in the CL fight - hell if we even just beat Villa on Saturday and got a result tonight we could easily have gotten a decent European spot. And sadly that‚Äôs one of the reasons Potter had to go, and perhaps should‚Äôve gone sooner as much as he was dealt a difficult hand",Chelsea,Yes,jewy9pc,t1_jewwcw2
This was a season where top 4 should have been relatively simple with any competent manager in charge.,Chelsea,Yes,jex4h4q,t1_jewwcw2
"If we wrested 3 more wins somewhere along this season we would be in top 4 fight, whereas we would be improving while others have stagnated or start sliding down.",Chelsea,Yes,jewzw6o,t1_jewwcw2
I‚Äôve gone from wishing Tuchel the best too praying that he fails so Nagelsmann looks better lol,Chelsea,Yes,jf15k9q,t1_jezjon8
"Simply can‚Äôt hire him for the club‚Äôs standing, you don‚Äôt go after someone like Poch who is ingrained with Spurs‚Äô bottling culture. Plus it‚Äôs the same way we clown Spurs for getting our ex-managers and flopping - we can‚Äôt start adopting their mentality",Chelsea,Yes,jewvq5x,t1_jewtf5w
I cannot overstate how true and accurate this statement is.,Chelsea,Yes,jewv8dq,t1_jewtf5w
"Boehly and co don‚Äôt care, they don‚Äôt understand the club‚Äôs culture at all.",Chelsea,Yes,jewzz15,t1_jewtf5w

This was funny to read. Thanks,Chelsea,Yes,jewfdf7,t1_jewd4kb
"I have a good feeling if Enrique joins, I can't explain why 

Just feel Enrique will work good for us, but logically Nagelsman is better, idk",Chelsea,Yes,jewkzyl,t1_jewkb2y
Which manager would we not have his required players. Apart from more general holes in DM/Striker and Goalkeeper there's enough for any manager.,Chelsea,Yes,jewshzd,t1_jewnp2t
This is CORRECT! Also Koulibaly mostly sucks in a back 4. I really think it‚Äôs worth it to see if he can be sold. Do you agree or am I crazy?,Chelsea,Yes,jezhk0e,t1_jezh9sy
Mount will definitely come good. He had played too much games till the past year. The baord needs to suck up and give him the contract instead of writing jail sentences as contracts. Signing Felix will make us a laughing stock especially when we already employ Havertz who's just as shit as him and Nkunku who's 10 times better than him,Chelsea,Yes,jf0aiav,t1_jezm13r
"Well we are playing top 6 opposition on 15th of April, let's hope",Chelsea,Yes,jewlb7m,t1_jew2wnw
"He didn't do a very good job at Brighton.

Since Brighton were relegation favorites when he arrived midtable is an achievement. The step up to use was too much too quick but that‚Äôs on the owners not him.,Chelsea,Yes,jexa51l,t1_jex7k7f
I heard Lukaku is a good witch doctor,Chelsea,Yes,jeyzo68,t1_jeyz73c
Uncomfortable conversation that needs to be had. Especially when we got nkunku coming in who plays the same position as felix,Chelsea,Yes,jezgp07,t1_jezerfj
Most of our chances were a product of Felix beating 2-3 men. I‚Äôm not sold on him either considering he‚Äôll cost a ton but he‚Äôs good.,Chelsea,Yes,jezfe7b,t1_jezerfj
"Right? We don't have a single forward even remotely close to the level of *one* of MSN. Enrique hasn't had success outside of using the best front 3 to ever exist and apparently he can do it at Chelsea? With what, Mudryk Havertz and Sterling?",Chelsea,Yes,jewc4su,t1_jew2wam
How the fuck do people want enrique man? We all watched spain at the World Cup and people want that at chelsea?,Chelsea,Yes,jew9a8o,t1_jew2wam
Sarcasm? We're not gonna see any difference for a while until a new manager comes in. Maybe we'll see players play with more freedom but I doubt that was a huge issue under Potter. Expect more of the same for now.,Chelsea,Yes,jew0pdw,t1_jevvhvw
Think he‚Äôs just injured still. I suspect he‚Äôll get the start against Madrid with Havertz and Pulisic.,Chelsea,Yes,jf0sun0,t1_jeytkzb
"He didn‚Äôt really have any pacy wingers or a good number 9 to choose from during the last World Cup which is why he had to turn to how they played. He even stated that himself. Spain looked mediocre with a few managers before he took the job. 

The definition of football terrorism is Southgate with the England squad. Please get it right. Luis Enrique would be a huge step up from Potter and he‚Äôd get the respect from everyone in that dressing room.",Chelsea,Yes,jew0n4z,t1_jevwlml
"I don‚Äôt think Croatia is less talented than Spain at this moment. And while Morocco might not be filled with stars, Hakimi and Ziyech (at least NT Ziyech) would probably earn a spot in Spain‚Äôs starting eleven.",Chelsea,Yes,jevxrdy,t1_jevwlml

What‚Äôs interesting is the way Bayern players and kimmich in particular seems to love nagelsmann and we‚Äôre all gutted when he got the boot. I think he got the wrong end of Bayern politics rather than sacked because he was doing a poor job.,Chelsea,Yes,jew3d2w,t1_jew13ib

"Tbf to him he won the Portuguese league and his team got absolutely raided last summer. Mattheus Nunes, Porro, palhinha all sold.

Would be better than potter anyway but yeah I'd rather nagelsmann. Tbh I wanted him to replace Lampard and give Lampard until the end of the season.",Chelsea,Yes,jewfwf5,t1_jew1vww
Ironically he scored twice for Croatia right before coming back from international games. We‚Äôre just Cursed FC tbh lol üòÇ,Chelsea,Yes,jez3sh8,t1_jez0q94
I wish players could get sacked. Most of the squad needs to be gone.,Chelsea,Yes,jevv25z,t1_jevt7bd
"Round of 16 exit, Conte in Europe is a joke no matter what squad he has.",Chelsea,Yes,jewmm8h,t1_jewionn

Fucking love it. Inject this.,Chelsea,Yes,jezewy6,t1_jeywy20
"Bayern sacked Naggelsman because they believed the treble was on the cards. Now he might be coming here, the circle of life is amazing.",Chelsea,Yes,jez07dk,t1_jeywy20
"What exactly are you on? The only profile of midfielder we should be looking into is a DM. Not another CM. There's a reason why there's only a Spanish football club in this year's CL 1/4 finals. We shouldn't just be buying and stocking up the squad. It is pertinent to only buy players on expediency. We already have Mount, Gallagher Chukwuemeka, Kante and Enzo, all fighting for 2/3 spots. Not to mention Loftus-Cheek as well. 

Gavi isn't essential to us.",Chelsea,Yes,jexnk1s,t1_jexlfg2
he lost the shirt cause of registration issues,Chelsea,Yes,jexy1nu,t1_jexlfg2
Just play Havertz in his correct role. Dude isn‚Äôt a striker. It‚Äôs the same thing as playing Kante as lone defensive mid.,Chelsea,Yes,jf0s05p,t1_jf0a508
How many of these academy players go on to become top players? Especially in the PL,Chelsea,Yes,jf0g5u4,t1_jf0cgxg
I think he‚Äôs going to brazil,Chelsea,Yes,jew96t1,t1_jew7bzi
Would be amazing but sadly he did say its either Madrid or retire so not happening,Chelsea,Yes,jewdivb,t1_jew7bzi
Some european money s better than no money at all. Plus like you said it is game time and a chance for the youngsters to gain experience,Chelsea,Yes,jewhxy8,t1_jewdw7s
"By that logic, why not play Auba?  I'm sure he now has something to prove following Potter's departure?",Chelsea,Yes,jex7pi6,t1_jex033n
"I doubt it, he's basically been fully demoted to the youth team. 


I think we could see Mount and Auba. But, with the comments from Bruno about ""the boys gave everything"" on the weekend, I wouldn't be surprised at all if he's just going to be a Potter clone and use the same players, just with with less attempts to replicate Pep's insane CL losing tactics",Chelsea,Yes,jex7wa0,t1_jex033n
Look at how many passes across the box we had against Aston villa. Noone was on the end of them,Chelsea,Yes,jf04bt0,t1_jezi8gv
Doesnt nearly everyone in this sub agree he‚Äôs not a sticker. Perhaps we‚Äôre all dumb cause yet another manager comes in and puts him up top,Chelsea,Yes,jez60sc,t1_jeyzn4j
Honestly we've never played Havertz in his natural position since we brought him. He can maybe flourish if we did but I'd rather an average yet reliable player that shows flexibility then 2 in 10 games havertz,Chelsea,Yes,jez5d3w,t1_jeyzn4j
Did we sell the wrong german player in the summer?,Chelsea,Yes,jf0ghbl,t1_jeyzn4j
"We can't sell most of the players we've bought though. The long contracts means that unless you sell them for basically what you bought them for, you're going to be fucked by FFP. Take Mudryk for example, if we sell him in summer for anything less than 80m, we'll take the difference in sale price all in one season with regards to FFP.

Why not? Because he‚Äôs ex spurs?,Chelsea,Yes,jewcrqc,t1_jew7dqy
"I think it was a combination of the fans booing at half and full time, the bizarre decisions he made and the fact that both Leicester and Spurs need managers and not wanting to let them get the guy they want.",Chelsea,Yes,jevz0a5,t1_jevyd7e
"100% and I hate them for it. Fucking pricks, this season is all their fault",Chelsea,Yes,jew9czl,t1_jevyd7e
"Yes because some fans will be irrational request to ask them to go for Tuchel after how terrible last 9 month of his reign is

"Maatsen is the only thing I wish we had from Burnley. I think Kompany will be a good manager but I think we need a steady hand at the moment, of the free agent coaches Poch makes the most sense to be and if we want until the summer I think more options will be available.",Chelsea,Yes,jex4x21,t1_jex3vrm
"That will essentially happen when Boehly buys another club. For example, managers/coaches of Salzburg are likely to later then move on up to Leipsig",Chelsea,Yes,jey01ym,t1_jextipx
Bald fraud.,Chelsea,Yes,jewfblq,t1_jewelig
Leao has attitude problems. I kinda agree that Leao is a more mature player in terms of goal  contributions but Mudryk isn't a lazy player,Chelsea,Yes,jex6n8f,t1_jex5too
"As with many of our signings, it's not so much X player would have been better than Y player. It's more a case of did we even need X or Y player? 



Given that he's barely seen the pitch, the answer was clearly no. Maybe we'll need a player in that role at some point, but it shouldn't have been rushed and there was no reason to pay such a huge premium for him.",Chelsea,Yes,jex7lvy,t1_jex5too
He has also had a bit of a goal drought before the weekend game.,Chelsea,Yes,jexlhe6,t1_jex5too
He‚Äôs on the bench.,Chelsea,Yes,jey4adq,t1_jexknhk
We gotta be patient with him and madueke. They weren't signed to make an impact now. Forget the price tag and look at the player currently and where he was before he moved here. Moving from the Ukrainian league to the premier league is not an easy switch. He's still very raw. Not a complete player yet. Same with madueke. Gotta be patient with these players bro,Chelsea,Yes,jexmnko,t1_jexknhk
"It's funny that the same publications that are releasing this now, were publishing how incredible of a job Potter was doing with the dressing room and how no other coach would be able to demand the respect he was still holding whilst having these results.

Because he wants to leave,Chelsea,Yes,jex0d2r,t1_jewzac4
"Had we fired Potter a bit earlier, he would 100% have been our first choice interim. But, as with so many things this season, we just waited too long and lost the opportunity",Chelsea,Yes,jex8188,t1_jewzac4
"Somewhat agree, we kinda have to nail this assignment or the club will be set back (more) years. I‚Äôm not sure about the unproven 35 year old one one hand, on the other his talent as a manager is undeniable and fits the profile for a long term project. Do not envy the decision makers here",Chelsea,Yes,jexr9yg,t1_jexq0xx
Who are the better (proven) prospects?,Chelsea,Yes,jexrjk7,t1_jexq0xx

How is zak garbage? Mans been great in midfield with the little time he had,Chelsea,Yes,jew8p92,t1_jevx20b
"Chelsea have bought without thinking of how to integrate. There has never been a plan. Perhaps the memo didn't have that players need regular game time to get into rhythm.

Out of all these players, Mount is for sure not garbage. It's a travesty to even suggest so. Will he start? He should. Play him in the hole. 

Not sure about the rest of them. Should we start Auba, given he's for sure gonna leave end of season? Are the minutes better spent with Havertz?",Chelsea,Yes,jew6u21,t1_jevx20b
"I don't think we will see any major changes.

Bruno has been with Potter most of his coaching career, and follows his style supposedly. It doesn't seem like he's trying to audition his secret hidden play style to become a Dark Horse choice for permanent manager.

"I would tend to agree up until his latest cases of misconduct with Spurs. His behaviour in the past few months shows he can't be treated seriously as a project manager. I used to love him, but not anymore.",Chelsea,Yes,jex8loa,t1_jewy6j1
"I loved Conte and him actually having a good recruitment team and $$$ behind him could be outstanding. But there's always the risk that he turns the environment toxic because he doesn't get everything he wants, or he just destroys some players he doesn't like even when that doesn't make sense for the club. His Champions League record is also abysmal. So I can see where you are coming from but I'd be against for those reasons and I doubt the owners would go for it.",Chelsea,Yes,jex3lkz,t1_jewy6j1
Would inquire about the XL!,Chelsea,Yes,jevzo1p,t1_jevvnsd

"Sterling still our second top goal scorer with best goals per minute of anyone in our squad despite being out for a fair stretch and having to play wingback at times under Potter. Played 10 less games than Kai. Joint top on assists too.

"His tactics and the way he sends him team with a siege mentality is similar to Mou 1.0 without the explosive press conferences. That era is done and dusted once Klopp and Pep (even Arteta is able to replicate similar setup) set their foot here, now manager needs to know how to organize their offense as well as defense like how Arteta is doing or FDZ is doing at a smaller scale. Strong foundational defense may allow us to win a UCL once in 5 years but its attacking football which will allow us to compete PL's,FA cups regularly. Besides even someone who has good skills in Felix looked very average in that Atletico team he can't coach attacking players to take that crucial step which is the need of the hour.",Chelsea,Yes,jevy89t,t1_jevxrgi
"I don't think he's the right fit. What we need most from the next manager is 1) identity building, 2) development of young players, 3) long-term commitment, 4) authority to get everyone to buy in. Zidane only really ticks the last of those boxes (although admittedly probably moreso than anyone else).

But he never had to develop any sort of identity at Real Madrid, he simply took over a fully developed squad and set them up well tactically on a game-by-game basis. His record of developing young players during his tenure also wasn't good - they signed a lot of players to eventually phase out the old guard, but most of them weren't given real chances and ultimately didn't develop. Ancelotti has done much better in that regard. With how much we're investing (and already have) in young players and the academy, an ability to develop talent is simply a must-have for the next manager. And then there's questions over his commitment - even at Real Madrid, where he's a beloved icon, it seemed he never really intended to stay for the long term. There are always reports that the job he's really looking for is the French NT. He has no emotional ties to Chelsea at all, so you'd have to wonder if he wouldn't just jump ship when things got difficult or a more appealing job opened up.",Chelsea,Yes,jew6n2r,t1_jew4r6z
"He does not speak good enough English (there was a quote a year or two ago where he said he speaks a bit but not enough to speak it in public), nor does his wife want to live outside of France or Spain. I don't think there's any chance of it happening.

Good coach though, he knows what it takes to win and players would listen to him.",Chelsea,Yes,jew5nue,t1_jew4r6z

He is already a coach at Chelsea for the youth team. Maybe your friend saw that and got confused.,Chelsea,Yes,jewd9a0,t1_jew00br
We just need to accept that the perfect unicorn manager isn't available at the moment and just hope someone can come in and do a job for 2 or so years.,Chelsea,Yes,jew2m6l,t1_jew0mfw
Would you prefer that it gets leaked that the Chelsea board was negotiating with other managers while Potter was still here? That surely would have gone well.,Chelsea,Yes,jew067c,t1_jevzokw

"H√∏jlund will be a fantastic addition at a very reasonable price, I‚Äôve watched him play, a big club will pick him up very soon. But it depends on the type of coach we bring in now IMO.",Chelsea,Yes,jewm4fe,t1_jewesxs
Is this a serious post or names from FM being used as satire?,Chelsea,Yes,jewj6oe,t1_jewesxs
"A powerful 20 year old that will be 24 next season??

Regarding striker we ideally need somebody in their prime... Older strikers don't work out for us short term, younger strikers don't work out for us long term.",Chelsea,Yes,jewjxbs,t1_jewesxs
"It'll be Nagelsmann or Enrique, but the squad is much closer to what Nagelsmann would want than what Enrique would want. Plus, our main issue for years has been scoring. Nagelsmann hasn't had an issue with that at three clubs. The only time Enrique hasn't had that issue was when he has a front line of Neymar-Suarez-Messi.

I'd be happy with either, but we'll hit a ceiling far faster with Enrique than Nagelsmann (but probably also establish a floor much faster at the same time)",Chelsea,Yes,jex0jwq,t1_jewsvlf
"It‚Äôs a difficult one, I‚Äôm honestly not convinced by any of the names we are linked to. 

Enrique - I think he‚Äôs decent but if you look outside of his Barca tenure he doesn‚Äôt seem like the man for me. Maybe his tactics could maximise our wingers but his Spain squad was as shite at finishing as ours  now 

Pochettino - his links with spurs would annoy most fans including me, that alone should rule him out but also he flopped at PSG and is overrated. 

Nagelsmann - best choice for me probably, tactically he seems to be very capable and he has experience working with board members like Vivell, integrating young talents etc. However there are questions about his man management which is so important at a club like Chelsea",Chelsea,Yes,jewudew,t1_jewsvlf

Would probably be the right move but unfortunately I see it being Chalobah who is sold.,Chelsea,Yes,jf013fh,t1_jezhk0e
I think we need to agree that Havertz might never be a 20goal contributor. If we agree then we might go out find/buy goals and assists rather than keeping in trying to push him to give the output.,Chelsea,Yes,jf20se1,t1_jf0aiav
Yeah I'm not that shocked when Tuchel got fired but super shocked & baffled to Potter appointment news. I just knew it he will be our Moyes from day 1 & turns out he's actually more mediocre lol,Chelsea,Yes,jexcv13,t1_jexbkih
"It would be impressive if they were just a promoted team that did well because of him.


But, the reality is that both the promotion and their continued climb BEFORE during AND AFTER are a show that the club is what made them climb and not Potter. He just happened to be the one that was there during the time they were climbing",Chelsea,Yes,jexgoz3,t1_jexa51l
Why tf Chelsea hired him in the first place though. We had an example of Moyes who imo had more impressive achievement compared to Potter getting relegation favorites Everton at that time to consistent upper midtable position but then turned Man U into a joke. I'm just worried this new Chelsea management will hire another Potter with stupid long contracts & tolerating another mediocrity for a long time in the name of 'trust the process',Chelsea,Yes,jexbscn,t1_jexa51l
"Is it even uncomfortable lmao ? He's done fuck all since coming here and doesn't even defend well for us , forget getting goals and assists",Chelsea,Yes,jf0amd0,t1_jezgp07
Actually this time not sarcasm. I agree it won‚Äôt be much of a change but just hoping it‚Äôs a breath of fresh air for the players as they aim to impress the new incoming manager whoever it is,Chelsea,Yes,jew10yr,t1_jew0pdw
"Yes looking at his stats its nothing short of amazing, he seems like he upset the wrong people which also shows his strong character that‚Äôs something we missed when Tuchel left.",Chelsea,Yes,jew3ymx,t1_jew3d2w
Nagelsmann had an issue where he was skiing after a defeat. So they wanted to have a 'crisis meeting' and he wasn't available. Then on top of this he had issues with his gf leaking stuff to bild.,Chelsea,Yes,jewg5it,t1_jew3d2w
"Yes but we see other teams with world star players not achieving half of what he did with that team, look at current PSG or Barca post Enrique they had more or less the same team minus Neymar and couldn‚Äôt achieve as much or play as well.",Chelsea,Yes,jew3pe6,t1_jew26oj
"His Spain team was very young and he still managed to lose in the Semi finals on penalties, and they were non stop creating chances and having shots but had horrible attackers. In my opinion they played the best football all tournament and outplayed every team they faced and they could have won the trophy if they had a half decent attacker.

The world cup exit cannot be excused but he clearly didn‚Äôt prepare well for that match plus having such a young team in the world cup is not ideal he needed more experienced players but again Spain had shortage of world class players after the Xavi-Iniesta generation but that seems to change now tho.",Chelsea,Yes,jew2xa0,t1_jew1x2r
Most? I csn count like 6 easily not more.,Chelsea,Yes,jevvknm,t1_jevv25z
If only the ownership had hired some staff to make football decisions for them...wait,Chelsea,Yes,jex0me4,t1_jewvb6o
Yeah. Not sure why he‚Äôs forgotten. I still think he‚Äôs not a solid 7 EVERY game. But agree he‚Äôs close,Chelsea,Yes,jf20ka1,t1_jezq62c
"Gavi is better than all of those, except maybe Enzo and could be available on a free. No matter who we currently he‚Äôd be worth getting",Chelsea,Yes,jexpp4z,t1_jexnk1s
bro if we get him on a free why the fuck not. Buying for expensive af would be dumb cos ffp and all that and no real need but on a free youd be dumb not to sign,Chelsea,Yes,jextoo2,t1_jexnk1s
"Free is free, we just wear the high wages. Are you aware of the situation there? 

Basically his contract is null and void and it reverted back to his development contract meaning that he can leave on a free from July.

It doesn‚Äôt affect the signing of a DM or striker, hell it could mean we raise money from selling a midfielder or two.",Chelsea,Yes,jexpve9,t1_jexnk1s
If he‚Äôs a 10 he still needs to be wayyyyy better at goal scoring. The missed chances yesterday were pathetic.,Chelsea,Yes,jf1mqnt,t1_jf0s05p
"Pathetic excuse. He's seen as a SS coz he can link up well yada yada but he's sill doing that as a striker. It's just he canr score nor provide assists. 

Havertz hasn't scored more than 25 goals in the PL in the past 3 years and hasn't assisted more than 15 goals. He's devoid of end product and even if he plays as a SS , nothing will change 

He's missing absolute sitters",Chelsea,Yes,jf0t2ue,t1_jf0s05p
"All I'm saying is , we should have kept Tammy as backup , sell KK and Cucurella in the summer , integrate Colwill and Maatsen.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0hqvq,t1_jf0g5u4
"True, honestly forgot about him lol",Chelsea,Yes,jexcivp,t1_jex7pi6
It‚Äôs wild how inconsistent our players are at making runs into the box when someone is attacking the byline. It‚Äôs been a problem for years honestly. We have no one who attacks the back post outside of Pulisic but dude is alway injured.,Chelsea,Yes,jf0sfjf,t1_jf04bt0
"No every time I point out how he bad he is, I immediately get downvoted. I‚Äôm glad opened the eyes of many. People have a weird obsession with this dude, thinking he will still become a Zidane-like player. That is simply not true. I promise you we wouldn‚Äôt be in the bottom half if we trusted Auba or Datro, who play his role a lot smarter and efficient than him",Chelsea,Yes,jf0eo6l,t1_jez60sc
"Everyone agrees he sucks as a striker or a 9, but for some fucking reason he keeps playing 90+ minutes as a striker. Yes probably we don't have much options but Auba was frozen out completely, fofana sent to development squad and now we are wondering, maybe we don't have a striker?

"A player that can only cause damage in ONE certain position and even then does not excel at a world class level is not worth keeping for me. He can‚Äôt hit the target, often has an awful touch, drifts away into spaces causing a promising attack to fizzle out. Can‚Äôt run in behind defenders, misplaces passes, average technique. He MUST leave in the summer.",Chelsea,Yes,jf0e8by,t1_jez5d3w
"Werner would‚Äôve loved these Enzo over the top passes for sure, but I don‚Äôt miss him regardless",Chelsea,Yes,jf0jian,t1_jf0ghbl

Yeah that‚Äôs what I think too. If we didn‚Äôt just go through the Potter shit I‚Äôd be more inclined to give it a go.,Chelsea,Yes,jex75ac,t1_jex56n8
"Yeah that‚Äôs why I am hesitant too. If we didn‚Äôt just go through the Potter debacle I think I would be more inclined to give him a shout. But man it‚Äôs tempting, I think he‚Äôs going to be a great EPL manager one day.",Chelsea,Yes,jex55ns,t1_jex4n3e
"I just feel like Leao would be the better choice to sign

"With all due respect Mudryk is 22 not 18 he should be expected to be somewhat productive. Havertz get killed all the time but has 125 senior club goals, Mudryk has 30 and is only 18 months younger.

"Don't think he did his job well at all. Let the whole second half go on without changing the system when they got a foot in the game.

Go watch the post match interview. Sick of this language of excuses and treating the players like they're kids who can't handle criticism. Breeds a loser mentality just like Potter.",Chelsea,Yes,jez2md3,t1_jez27ne
Boehly would‚Äôve found a way to sack him,Chelsea,Yes,jewd8sb,t1_jewc68u

CLs? I reckon‚Ä¶ three. Minimum.",Chelsea,Yes,jexrrut,t1_jewc68u
"He's a bit raw, but he can really add something that we need from a forward. His movement is a lot like the best number 9s right now in Haaland/Osimhen, but he needs time. We might be able to give him that with our rebuild.",Chelsea,Yes,jexbeov,t1_jex8vew
Sure he'd take a first team manager role for 10 games & get his move in the summer if we offered.,Chelsea,Yes,jexabvt,t1_jex0d2r
"Unproven 35 year old? He‚Äôs taken two teams to CL qualification. He has just as much managerial experience as pretty much anybody. You all are just hung up on his age. Age has nothing to do with it though. I suggest you look up his stats as a manager compared to some of these other ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù managers. Out of all of the available options that can manage right now Nagelsmann has the best resume. 

Enrique was able to have success at Barcelona because of NSM. His football tactics and style would just be the same boring possession based we have had forever.",Chelsea,Yes,jexvhmp,t1_jexr9yg

Sent you a chat message!,Chelsea,Yes,jew53pu,t1_jevzo1p
Sterling should‚Äôve come on for Havertz at around 65-70th minute. I agree with you here but your hatred for the language being used by a temporary manager who‚Äôs never managed a club before is stupid. Get real here there‚Äôs no real positive outcome from talking shit about your players finishing in a post match interview. The work is done behind closed doors. You think it helps some 22 year old kids confidence to be picked on by some guy who‚Äôs never managed a team before? Come on bro.,Chelsea,Yes,jezbzm4,t1_jezb509
Sean Dyche can never ever win La Liga twice and get into CL final with that squad twice,Chelsea,Yes,jew127v,t1_jevyoju
"I know it's going to be an extremely unpopular opinion but I really think Zidane isn't ""proven"" yet. He's managed a grand total of 1 club, which he didn't imprint any style onto - he fulfilled the duty of manager much more so than coach and relied on an experienced world class set of winners to handle it on the pitch. I knew we'd wipe the floor with them when we faced them under Zidane (2021) and although he had injuries to deal with that season, every time I watched them play it seemed like a whole lot of side to side unimaginative possession followed by a cross into a Benzema goal/individual brilliance. 

Sure, his trophies are indicative of the fact that he's an excellent manager. But as a coach I don't think he's proven to be all that yet. And I feel like he's not going to risk his reputation now either, he seems happy to sit out until the France job opens up.",Chelsea,Yes,jew9tu1,t1_jew6n2r
What's your opinion on getting Ancelotti (if there's ever a chance) in the summer? I'm not really keen on any of the names that have been mentioned so far.,Chelsea,Yes,jewef5f,t1_jew6n2r

"Agree, we should stay away from the next big thing and hire a manager with a longer track record of building up a club.

"people are getting fooled by the flick and tricks he does or attempts to do. Take away that and look at actually what he does in the final third, he is no where near the amount atletico want us to pay for him in the summer if we were interested in buying him.

"World star players and MSN aren't even comparable, the chemistry those 3 had was elite. Enrique had an infinitely better squad than Barca currently and PSG what are you on about lol.

His time at Spurs (the last season) and PSG are bad representation of his managerial capabilities imo. At Spurs he was never really given good, structured backing and PSG is a political shithole with a squad unfit for his style of football.

I do think Enrique did better with the Spain NT then people give him credit for. People taking recency bias and their early elimination to Morocco as a point against him, but the current Spanish talent pool ain't exactly at the level they had from the 2000s. I think he did a solid job with them.

"If anyone is interested to learn a bit more about Nagelsmann's approach to buildup, here's this very in-depth segment where Rangnick and Nagelsmann himself go into quite a lot of detail about it - it even has English subtitles (somewhat rough but they convey the most important messages well enough). The wonders of German football culture, where everyone talks to the media about anything in excessive detail. Very good watch.

https://youtu.be/v8tCTTskT1E

A summary if you can't watch: Nagelsmann says that there are different approaches to playing against deep opposition, he prefers to draw out as many players into a press as possible, bypass the first line of it and then play quick combinations exploiting situational overloads and the 1v1 ability of his wingers to create from there. 

In Bayern's back 4 system, he has the RB (Stanisic or Pavard) invert into midfield to form a 2-3 structure while the LB (Davies) pushes up high into the front line - Nagelsmann even saying he isn't completely satisfied when Davies isn't literally playing on the last line and making runs in behind. M√ºller and Musiala (playing LW) drop a little to offer passing outlets while Gnabry (RW) and Davies (LB) provide the width. Lewandowski is also free to drop deeper and offer an additional option, crowding out opposition midfielders in 2v1 situations against M√ºller/Lewy or Musiala/Lewy.

He also likes the 2-3-5 structure because it allows a 3-man block in midfield to counterpress quickly if possession is lost (which in itself is often a good way of catching opposition out and enabling chances as they can be caught in transition).

They also go into detail about his team having so many players in the box, to which he says it isn't only a form of attacking but also of defending. By having 5, 6, sometimes even 7 players in the box, you're binding opposition players there too, because the rule of thumb is to at least never be outnumbered in your own box. Attacking-wise it gives them higher chances to get to win second balls, score rebounds, etc., and defending-wise it's the same counterpressing principle that applies everywhere else, with the added benefit of having a ton of opposition players pushed in deeper away from your own goal - you've got a lot of players close to the ball to counterpress immediately, usually forcing at best a speculative long ball that your rest defence can then deal with relatively easily.

All in all, there's a lot to like there that would apply directly to us. Not just the exact buildup scheme (that in itself isn't new at all, even though multiple people on this sub have told me that a back 4 would limit attacking fullbacks and yet here you are with a LB playing basically LW), but the way Nagelsmann thinks about football. He's a modern, attack-minded coach who views a lot of defending through an attacking lense (defending through possession, high positioning to win possession back ASAP and as far away from your own goal as possible). The most revealing part here though is how he wants to approach playing against deep blocks, which, if you've watched us at all over the last 10 years, has been THE issue we've struggled with.

"I dont want to ruin this for you but I think you‚Äôre way to optimistic about Nagelsmann. Yes, he can be a really good option (maybe the best option) but he isn‚Äôt the second coming of Guardiola/ Klopp/ Ancelotti at this very moment.

1) His tactic was often criticized because it works for a smaller club but not for a top club: no midfield dominance, mostly relied on counters, struggled agains low blocks

2) I see several people point at the UCL games. Barca almost knocked out Bayern in the Allianz arena in the first half. PSG scored 3 offside goals when they subbed in Mbappe. There was no dominant display from Bayern. Individual brilliance often saved them in the UCL from conceding goals (De Ligt huge save against PSG for example) They had the least amount of cleans sheets in 15 years in the BuLi under Nagelsmann and some lesser teams like Gladbach or Bochum scored 4-5 times against them. This brings us to the second problem: inconsistency. Which is the true side of Bayern? Conceding 2 goals in 8 games in the UCL or conceding 29 goals in 26 games?

3) He failed to find his starting 11 in almost two years. Sane played as a LW, CF,RW, CAM under Julian. Nor Gnabry, Coman, Muller or Musiala played in the same role for a longer stretch. Nagelsmann can come up with brilliant solutions but he struggles when the opposition adapts to his plans. 

I‚Äôm not here to say that he is a terrible decision for Chelsea. He can be IT i have no doubt about that but please watch some games and see yourself that it is not like Bayern sacked him for no reason. If Chelsea can give him time, there will be no expectations like winning the PL or UCL next year he can develop into a true gem.

"Having explained in some detail what makes Nagelsmann a good manager in previous posts, here's a list of my concerns:

1 - And basically the main worry I have is that I'm not sure he's an identity builder. He's an astute tactical manager, but he has a tendency to be overly reactive to opposition instead of building the identity that works for his teams and then developing players accordingly. This is fine when you're at Hoffenheim, Leipzig and Bayern, where previous managers have already introduced a certain identity (heavy Rangnick influence at Hoffenheim and Leipzig, Pep and Flick setting the tone at Bayern) and they're ready to take on board tactical tweaks for certain games and get wins that way. But it won't be fine at Chelsea - we're going to need to figure out from the ground up what football philosophy the squad is best suited for. In my opinion, this needs to be a possession-heavy, counterpressing and very attacking side that can effectively break down the endless stream of deep blocks we face every season. You can afford a poor record in big games if you're reliably winning against the much more numerous teams that sit deep. Build for that first, then go from there and you'll be looking at a squad that should at least finish top 4 pretty consistently. Stabilizing us at that level has to be the primary task. And that will require a very clear identity built from the ground up, with young players needing clear guidance as to their roles and behaviors inside clearly organized structures. Nagelsmann is someone who switches formations a lot and I'm not sure that's what we need now at all. It's not conducive to building a team from scratch. If you're giving me a choice between a manager like Sarri and his rigid 433, or a Nagelsmann and his 5 different formations with little twists like wingers sometimes playing wingback, I'm taking the rigid manager right now. Keeping things simple enough in a rebuilding job is important imo, and I'm not sure that Nagelsmann does that in his overarching approach. At the same time, I don't think he's quite as good and refined tactically as someone like Tuchel who will basically ""coach a win"" against pretty much anyone regularly. 



2 - I've seen the usual lot complain about Nagelsmann not emphasizing youth enough and while I think that's a bit overblown (no great academy at Leipzig and a very hard squad to break into at Bayern) I would agree that there isn't really a track record to judge him by. His career is pretty young still and this simply isn't something he's had to do that much of. But it will be an important part of the job at Chelsea as it's a clear part of the project to sign young players, finish their youth development at Cobham and then promote the very best to the first team. That's particularly hard to do when you're coming in and establishing a new identity from scratch while also being expected to meet certain targets (CL qualification at the very least), but it will matter. There are other managers out there who perhaps have more references to point to in this regard.",Chelsea,No,jes83yv,t3_12aa0uv

"The more I read and think about it the more I begin to contemplate that perhaps rushing a manager is not the best idea. What has this season been all about? Rushing. Rush the signing, rush the manager, rush it, give me results and let's talk about a process later.

Let's think about it clinically. Season's dead, top four not to say six is practically impossible. The Champions League leg is a hard one, really hard. What would hurrying a new manager bring? A rushed tactic for the CL leg? Okay, and why can't the interim do that? The results would probably be the same with such a timeframe - sure, you can bet on a miracle, but you can bet on a miracle with the interim, it's no difference. The original miracle was Di Matteo of all people, an interim.

So honestly, it'd be better if the club stood still for more than 4 damn days and thought about everything that needs to be thought, let the sporting area come with a draft of ideal conditions in a manager and only begin the search with sights on the next season.

"I think we got rid of Potter a little too late, making this season really hard to  have anything to compete for. We have Madrid but that will be tough with an interim. 

I‚Äôm not too sure about the managerial candidates I‚Äôm reading up on. I think Nags is levels above potter but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs what we need right now. I‚Äôd rather have a more stern coach in their principles of play than another coach who ‚Äúadapts tactics‚Äù all the time. Obviously coaches adapt their tactics but usually have a foundation they‚Äôve built and adjust from there. 

Enrique having seen Spain and followed him loosely beyond that seems like he would flop here as well. He gets very cute with his lineups and how he wants his players to play and if they all buy in it looks good if you have generational attacking talent but as we‚Äôve seen when he doesn‚Äôt have that level of attack it turns into a lot of sideways passing and nothing to show for it.

Amorim seems still too early in his coaching. Another back 3 specialist that likes to use inverted fullbacks or wingers as inverted wingbacks. He has a bit of Potter and Nags in him when it comes to positional play but is much more aggressive in his tactics. He‚Äôs also in 4th right now even though I know Sporting have lost key players but so has Schmidt at Benfica and he has built a tremendous side.

Which brings me to who I think we should get and honestly I don‚Äôt think the manager we‚Äôd want to take over is available. I‚Äôd love for Flick to come in if for nothing else to play very exciting football. He has suicide defense tactics but so does Nags/Amorim. He has a ser patter of play in attack and I think would get the best out of our wide players.  But he‚Äôs not available so who should we get?

2. Poch- fullbacks we‚Äôre a big part of his tactical philosophy and we have some of the best in the league.                                                                                  
3. Gallardo- might be hard to get him- but he was excellent at River Plate and highly regarded.

">I don't particularly like him as a person, but he's a good manager with the right philosophy.

Why do you not like him as a person? Anything you reckon that would eventually make his tenure untenable at Chelsea? 

Honestly the main reason I'm excited about appointing him is the direct attacking football that we've sorely lacked for years. Both Tuchel and Potter seemed to want more control on the ball, especially the former, and it becomes virtually impossible to consistently put multiple goals past defensively resolute teams if we just allow them to get back into shape everytime there's a good attacking opportunity. Can see him using Mudryk a lot like Werner for eg, getting him the ball into space quickly with offensive patterns that have him constantly attacking the last line.",Chelsea,Yes,jerekya,t1_jerdmnj

I spent the entirety of yesterday looking up Julian Nagelsmann, most used players, interviews, tactics at Hoffenheim, Bayern and Leipzig. His interviews, other interviews about him, Training methods etc. 

One thing that I pray for is that he uses either LM's and RM's or he coaches Mudryk in spaces that LWB's occupied in our old system. Chilwell and Reece are simply not explosive enough like Davies or even Angelino. 

What are your thoughts on Gusto? I've watched him a bit and he seems a lot more winger'esque than James. Seems like a good attacking wingback fit for Nagelsmann if he wants his RWB/RM to bomb forward or take on players like Davies did at Bayern. James will really have to step up his game to compete.

"Think Nagelsmann has a bit more upside to beat the better teams in the league and UCL with the central and vertical attacking style, but might have more variance and leak goals (think this is why he says a DM and keeper are the 2 most important positions). Enrique can definitely be great if he sticks and develops or gets better wingers along with the FB talent we have. Tons of possession and maybe some frustrating sideways passing but can be extremely effective and dominant how Tuchel was at times. A bit worried about Enrique being out of club ball for a while.

He did relatively well for Roma, just like some other coaches after him, Rudi Garcia for example, and didn‚Äôt really make a major dent or built something up with the Spanish national team.

Won a treble with MSN and half the Pep team still there.

Meanwhile, Nagelsmann brought a mid-table team into the CL at Hoffenheim and continued the worked started by Rangnick at RB, with which he reached a CL semifinal in 2020.

I kind of get it. With every loss the club was getting more and more toxic. Boehly and Eghbali might have had the patience for Potter but since the arrival of the actual football experts (Vivell and Winstanley) they might have seen that this wasn't going anywhere. Getting rid now and at the end of the season, does it really make a difference? It probably appeases the fan base more to do it now rather than waiting 10 more games

Then, just as with the Tuchel firing, they claim it's a long term decision and not something they made in anger on the day of a loss and it just happened to happen the morning after a completely unrelated loss. But, in reality they just snapped again after a loss and fired him the next day.

"Let‚Äôs say he joins and gets a striker, a keeper and a DM in the summer.

4231:

New keeper; Chilwell, Badiashile, Fofana, James; Enzo, DM; Sterling, Nkunku, Madueke; new striker. 

James inverts, forming a 235 in possession with an option to go forward and form 226 vs extremely defensive teams. If Mudryk plays, I‚Äôd rather have Cucurella instead of Chilwell, so MM can play wide left instead and Cucu is quite good at inverting. 

343:

New keeper; Colwill, Silva, Fofana; Chilwell, Enzo, Kova, James; Nkunku, New striker, Sterling

4231 is my favourite option but Nagelsmann is also a fan of 3atb systems as well so we will definitely see those of he joins. Colwill is perfect for the Rudiger role, Fofana is aggressive and can cover big spaces and cover for Silva. 3cbs + a DM is an overkill imo so I‚Äôd have Kova playing in pivot. This is numerically the same thing as 235 buildup but it‚Äôs 325 instead. 

We could also see 4222 with Chilwell, Badiashile, Fofana, James; Enzo, DM, Sterling, Mount, Madueke; Nkunku, Striker. 

He‚Äôs not a coach that implements a rigid system though so that could be challenging at first. We‚Äôll see what happens",Chelsea,Yes,jergmy4,t1_jeresh2
"Seeing as no one had a clue Potter would be sacked before the club statement, I wouldn‚Äôt particulary trust much that comes from the media.",Chelsea,Yes,jerhbh3,t1_jeresh2
">On an unrelated note, I wonder which 14/15 players would frequently be a part of Nagelsmann's starting XI (if he joins) and who'd benefit the most from his appointment. Would be interested to see how some of you (who've followed his teams) think we'd line up like under him.

Hard to guess beyond a few names as the summer clearout will likely be done mostly by the club with the new manager's input and it's hard to predict who will still be here. It also strongly depends on the systems Nagelsmann decides to run.

What I would say is that all our fullbacks probably benefit. There are varied roles for all of them - Chilwell, Reece and Gusto can play as actual wingbacks in a back 3, Cucurella and Reece can definitely play an inverted fullback role in a back 4 while the other pushes high up (that could be Chilwell, Reece or Gusto). There's enough variety in how he uses his fullbacks to suggest that good roles can be found for all of them.

I'd also expect Enzo and Kovacic (if he stays) to benefit. Nagelsmann stresses the importance of strong buildup midfielders against defensive teams (which we face all the time) and those two are our best in that department. I could see another midfielder with those qualities coming in to give us depth.

Nagelsmann wanted Nkunku and Felix at Bayern and it's easy to see why. With an asymmetrical buildup approach (say with the LB wide in a front 5), it allows the LW to tuck into almost the striker position, which would suit ""second striker"" type players who would on paper line up at LW in this scenario. Those players (Havertz too) also work well as options between the lines to link play with the one-touch combinations he's looking for after bypassing the initial press he wants to suck opposition into.

In an asymmetrical buildup shape, I could also see the wide wingers doing well. Say our RW is providing width, I could see that as a very good role for someone like Madueke. He's powerful so wouldn't struggle in physical duels against a fullback that steps out to pressure him, he's technically good and fast enough to win these 1v1 duels. On the other hand, if we do play similarly to Bayern with the LB pushing so high up, I could see Mudryk struggling. He's a real wide player, not someone you want inverting too much. So in some back 3 setups, I could actually see Mudryk playing LWB. But he'd probably be used at his best in an asymmetrical shape with the RB pushing up and him at LW providing width on that side.

In a 2-3 buildup shape, you'd probably also be a bit worried about Thiago Silva. Badiashile will be very important as he's got all the qualities for that setup (attacking and defensive), Colwill also looks an excellent fit, but RCB is more problematic. Silva has the quality in possession, but with a 2-3 shape, more emphasis is put on the buildup qualities of the midfielders (plus the inverted fullback), so Silva's quality in possession isn't as necessary as it is in a 3-2 with a back 3. If Fofana can stay fit, I could see him overtaking Silva. Koulibaly could benefit from this setup too as it wouldn't force him to make constant decisions about stepping out or not, which have mostly been the problem with him. But who knows if he stays - if he doesn't, I could easily see a new RCB being signed as depth for Fofana and Silva. 

Who I really don't see benefitting is Mount. Nagelsmann isn't a 433 manager, and his focus on precise, one-touch football in the final third doesn't favor him either. He can't play pivot, Nkunku/Felix/Kai should play ahead of him at 10 in a 4231 and Felix, Mudryk, Nkunku, Sterling should all be playing LW ahead of him too.

Others that I'm not really feeling for Nagelsmann are Ziyech, Zakaria, Pulisic, perhaps Havertz (although German connection is a plus for him, depends on system and whether Felix joins permanently and a striker is signed - if not, Kai will have to play ST again most likely), Aubameyang (doesn't offer enough counterpressing, not fast enough to be a credible threat in behind anymore, no physical presence in the box), not sure about Santos (lots of improvement necessary in possession from what little I've seen but obviously very talented), and not sure about Kant√© either. Nagelsmann would love Kant√© in big games (he'd probably pick him ahead of Kovacic there), but I'm not sure he offers enough going forward in a midfield that has to be precise and progressive under pressure (because Nagelsmann de-emphasizes opening up space for them structurally, in favor of pushing more players up higher into the front line to set up overloads for the midfielders to find) against most opposition we face. The only comparable player Nagelsmann used in the past was Laimer and he's much better in possession imo, even playing lone DM at times and orchestrating play from there. I'm not sure I see the role for Kant√© on a regular basis. Sterling would probably have to play the wide RW position, which I'm not sure is his best role as he's not the best dribbler and can be susceptible to a fullback pressuring him from behind.

I'd probably expect a 4231, 4222, 343 or even a modern 352 with actual wingers as wingbacks and someone like Reece or Cucurella playing one of the outside CB positions - that's been pretty popular lately. But Nagelsmann is flexible enough in his systems to make it hard to tell - he's used all the above before.",Chelsea,Yes,jerlps1,t1_jeresh2
"Alright, here's how I think we *might* work under Nagelsmann. Going for a back 3 in possession but a 2-3-5 in possession will only need a couple of changes. Kepa in goal, that's the best we've got atm. 

Colwill Badiashile and Fofana back 3. A Midfield 2 of Kova, Enzo or Enzo and Mount. Mount offers us more in pressing, Kova is the better player BTL. Kante is a hybrid of the two. Enzo is, well, Enzo. 

I can see 4 players behind the striker, Felix in the left half space, Nkunku in the right half space. Mudryk holds the left flank, Gusto holds the right. No comments on the striker situation. Perhaps Kai is the best option.

This team will fall into a 4-2-2-2 or a 4-4-2 if needed with Colwill at LB.

If it's a 2-3-5 then this is how I want to see us play-

Back 2 of Fofana and Badiashile.

Reece goes into Midfield from RB. Enzo and Kante as the other two Midfielders. Kante ready to counterpress if we lose the ball. Ideally we need to bring in a new Midfielder who can press well and help in attack. (Mount under Lampard season 2 type of thing). Again, in the front 5, I want to see Mudryk and Madueke as the widest players. Or Mudryk to the right and Chilwell on the left flank.

">Why do you not like him as a person? Anything you reckon that would eventually make his tenure untenable at Chelsea? 

Ah, nothing like that. He's just very German - a bit abrasive, a bit arrogant, coupled with his youth it comes across particularly strongly. Tuchel had that too to some degree but he's earned the right and he'd go into tremendous detail to justify his views. 

>Honestly the main reason I'm excited about appointing him is the direct attacking football that we've sorely lacked for years. Both Tuchel and Potter seemed to want more control on the ball, especially the former, and it becomes virtually impossible to consistently put multiple goals past defensively resolute teams if we just allow them to get back into shape everytime there's a good attacking opportunity. Can see him using Mudryk a lot like Werner for eg, getting him the ball into space quickly with offensive patterns that have him constantly attacking the last line.

Well, control of the ball will still be a huge factor under Nagelsmann. And that's inevitable to some degree - top clubs dominate possession, press to win it quickly, face deep blocks all the time. We're not even particularly extreme about it this season - we've been bad and teams have actually played more football against us than usual. Arteta said in February that Arsenal had already faced 16 low blocks this season, and that's pretty much in line with how many I usually estimate for us as well (24, +/- the odd one) across a whole PL season.

Controlled, structured possession is inevitable against that type of opposition. You can't play direct football when you're constantly outnumbered in the opposition half, all the passing lanes are blocked and there's no space in behind for a long ball over the top. The way to break these teams down will always be passing combinations through multiple stations to draw opposition players out of their positions and create momentary weaknesses to exploit through (ideally) fluid movement and precise ""impact passes"" (one of Tuchel's favorite terms) - the pass that finds the player exploiting the momentary weakness created.

So when people say they want direct football then, well, you have to complain to opposition managers. By sitting deep, they force that type of approach. Then it's about the quality of combinations you attack with, and this is where I personally want drilled and repeatable passing patterns. Nothing else has worked for us. There's an excellent Athletic piece about Arteta's coaching which shows that he'll repeatedly drill Sarri-esque combinations in the front line (a player drops to show for the ball, lays it off to someone close, a third man makes a run in behind). ""Vertical tiki-taka"" is what people called it at Napoli, and this type of attacking pattern is what Sarri became famous for. And lo and behold, it's outstandingly simple and effective, but it needs to be drilled so that players can automatize their positioning and behavior. To work on positioning with this, Arteta also does drills with ""shadow opposition"" (mannequins). Because we're talking about mostly one-touch combinations here, this needs to be automatic behavior or it'll simply result in giveaways or extra touches, ruining the pattern. But when these patterns don't work, you need to recycle possession and go again elsewhere. That's why the base of controlled possession is so important. I know a lot of people don't like it, but it's not a choice the top clubs can make. Football simply works that way when opposition sits deep. You can try to play differently but it'll yield worse results. The main differences aren't in how controlled possession is, it's in 1) what areas teams prioritize to attack from (wide or central), which should be reflected in their attacking structure, 2) how well drilled they are at what they're trying to do, 3) the individual quality of players within these combinations. Our possession often looked stale or slow partially because individual quality just wasn't there with the personnel we chose and we had to recycle more often than other top teams with high possession, therefore making it look like we prioritized ""sideways passing"", which is ridiculous. Sideways passing happens when your pattern hasn't worked, you recycle and shift the ball to find the appropriate angle to try again. Because our combinations weren't good enough, they broke down more frequently, resulting in more sideways passing having to be done as we tried to go again. 

My issue with Tuchel here wasn't so much that he wanted to control possession, it's that he was overly conservative in his approach to it. When you control 70% of the ball, there's zero need for a 3-2 buildup setup and two fullbacks as your wingbacks. Sure, Reece and Chilwell contributed a lot going forward this way, but 1) just like Nagelsmann shows above, you can have attacking fullbacks in the front line out of a back 4 setup, 2) you're more effective having a technical and more attack-minded fullback inverting into midfield on one side than you are with a third CB stepping out (because again, behaviors are automatic to some degree and a CB, no matter how much you want them to step out, will always be a CB) - the same applies to a 2-3-5 setup with 3 actual midfielders and both fullbacks playing high. At the same time, he never went as far as Nagelsmann describes here with pushing players up into the opposition box. Tuchel was absolutely rigid about his 5-5 split (and already introduced it again in his first game at Bayern), even against super defensive teams. And that's just unnecessary. Nagelsmann spells it out here - by pushing more players up in and around the opposition box, you're binding them there and that means they're not outlet options for counterattacks. Now, if opposition already play super deep and push their players into their own half willingly, they're binding themselves in these deep areas. So why are you then still defending in a 5-man defensive block? It's simply not good - you're vastly outnumbered in the opposition half and won't be able to counterpress them high very effectively, but you're vastly outnumbering them in your own deeper areas, to the point of overkill. If opposition leaves 1-2 players up and otherwise get everyone behind the ball, why are you sticking to your 5-man defensive split? Defending 5v2 is absurdly conservative. We were never fluid enough with this, Tuchel was too stubborn about it. Think about it - one side makes a tactical move (sitting in very deep), the other doesn't (we hardly ever broke the 5-5 split). You're not reacting to the opposition here, you're making their objectives (play not to lose) easier to accomplish by not reacting properly. People say Tuchel is a tactical genius and he is in some respects, but he was always too conservative at Chelsea and that too is a tactical flaw, imo. Nagelsmann or anyone else who comes in needs to do away with that and just have 5, 6, 7 players in and around the box at the end of our moves. That will require a more attacking setup in system, personnel and overall approach.",Chelsea,Yes,jeri1tv,t1_jerekya

Enrique edges it for me atm. I've seen clear rebuilding jobs from him at Barcelona and Spain, with two very different stylistic approaches designed around the strengths and weaknesses of the team. 

Mind you, this wasn't just the same Barca that everyone was successful with - Enrique changed the roles of established players significantly (even Messi's), brought Rakitic into the team and phased out Xavi (Iniesta's influence also heavily reduced to favor the attacking trio). He built a team that would be very organized behind the front three, combine there and then release them quickly. They were almost a counterattacking team under him.

With Spain, he favored the collective approach as there just isn't any individual quality there in attack. They basically have no competent wingers (fucking Adama Traore made their squad) or strikers (Morata), so he decided the way to go was to get as much passing quality on the pitch in every other position and just try to create as much as possible with a pretty static style of play built around the passing quality of their deeper and attacking midfielders. Sometimes that worked great, sometimes no so much - but the fact that he was able to instill any sort of clear identity into the NT was impressive for me. NTs usually are just a mess, but his were very clear in their approach, even if people didn't like the specifics of it.

That's pretty much what I'm looking for from our next manager. It needs to be someone with clear ideas who doesn't swap systems too much (ideally sticking with some attacking back 4 variant), and who will develop young players. I'm not sure about the last bit with Enrique, but it's the less important part anyway and among our rumored options only Pochettino really has a clear track record of that.",Chelsea,Yes,jesdf3k,t1_jesbl32
"I like him, others not so much. I like that (while he's not rigidly married to a system or style), he's much more consistent with it than someone like Nagelsmann. You're more likely to get a stable 433 from Enrique, for example. Personally don't buy this idea that MSN carried him - he put them in position to do that by drilling a new style of play into a Barca squad that had ridden the Pep wave for years, where managers never really made an impact.

He chose a more collective approach with Spain because their attack is flat out bad - no 1v1 ability anywhere on the pitch, no real wingers, but also not a good striker there.

Also, as reports are coming out that players weren't really listening to Potter's instructions - that wouldn't happen with Enrique.",Chelsea,Yes,jesb8m1,t1_jes8x9w
"Will be good if we can clone younger versions of MSN, outside of that it'd be a bit dodgey. Not to mention the end of his tenure at Spain looks like he has the inability to fix what plagued for us for the last 3 seasons, lots of passing and possesion with no creativity, no threatening balls, and an inability to break down low blocks.",Chelsea,Yes,jes9vm1,t1_jes8x9w

Some things to like about him: he plays very quick and aggressive football. He wants to move the ball as fast possible and creates overloads on the sidelines to have numbers and push the ball forward quickly. Likes to dominate possession but moves at a quick pace so he can play against low blocks. He‚Äôs also great at managing in-game tactics and his subs are usually difference makers for him. He‚Äôs flexible in his formations but prefers a back 4 with his full backs pushing up high and wide. 

My only complaint is that he likes to progress through passing and not dribbling so wingers like Madueke and Mudryk would probably suffer unless they work on their one touch passing. He‚Äôs also a lot like Tuchel where his tactics are much better in one-off games than over the course of a season.

Now that was a ridiculous sacking. 

And then Tuchel picked up Lampard‚Äôs team and went on a nice run in a weird COVID-affected Champions League season. And that was an amazing thing, don‚Äôt get me wrong.

When it comes to breaking down a low block, I‚Äôd also add the high value of players taking their man on to create space. That‚Äôs what Pep‚Äôs done very well this season.

Another new signing that imo will thrive is Gusto. As unpopular as this sounds, I think he's good enough to bench Reece if Reece doesn't fix up.

We dominate the game, create chances, missing the easy 1 on 1 and hit the post somewhere in between, and then we concede due to a freak shot or some stupid mistake by the defender (either by KK or Chalobah), then we go back to first step and dominate the game without any end product and eventually lose the game

Potter has to go but sometimes I would think if these mfers can score a tap in or 1 on 1s, or if those million times we hit the post and went in instead of bouncing out instead we would be saying the club is doing well",Chelsea,Yes,jerixtu,t1_jerieub
"They weren't great shots. Mudryk had a clear chance that a composed striker would've finished, whilst our second best chance fell to Kante.... Chilwell hit the outside of the post but it was a tight 85 degree angle from goal. Most of the rest of the shots were at 2-3 defenders, we never had any opportunities from crosses (nobody on the end of them if they did come in at all), and the tactical decisions were fucking bizarre. Two fullbacks as part of the back 3 (with Badi and Chalobah on the bench???), Kante deployed on the right wing, Reece only getting forwards a couple of times all game (to make crosses to nobody). RLC was a vacuum, Kovacic got closer to the moon than the goal with his shots. 


Chilwell was amazing and visibly pissed off from very early in the game (angry at KK playing a dumb pass). For most of the match he was getting hacked by Villa players because it was clear he was the only one who turned up. He made amazing runs off the ball that only he would've been capable of seeing. He made loads of crosses to nobody in the box because nobody ran forwards when he did. If we had 10 Chilwells the game would've been 10-0.",Chelsea,Yes,jerpscq,t1_jerieub
"Before Villa scored, they looked the most likely to score, playing on the break. After Villa got the first, they then locked it down a bit more.

The McGinn goal was a bit of a bonus, and I‚Äôd say 1-1 would have been a fair score on he balance of play. Chilwell‚Äôs goal was a perfectly good goal; the ref was smoking crack to rule that out.",Chelsea,Yes,jeriy99,t1_jerieub
"Yeah guy who replied to you did a misleading assessment of the game. Cucurella was at lcb.

Missed couple of good chances.
Get sucker punched by Cucurella and Koulibaly mixup(more cucurellas fault)

Can't break villa down because too slow and nobody in the box, RLC refused to cross the ball and when he did the crosses were worse than Azpilicuetas.

Kepa concedes another long shot that seems like a worldie but Mendy saves them 9/10 times due to longer reach.

We had possession but did nothing with it.",Chelsea,Yes,jermfoi,t1_jeritmg
"I'm hoping that such adaption would naturally lead to youth development- Mudryk, Enzo etc aren't going anywhere and someone like Colwill is an obvious talent. In theory im not sure how much of the squad he would like so he would definitely have to adapt and we would have to bring some pieces in. I'm sure in interviews points like this will be raised. The MSN criticism of Enrique seemed harsh to me, much more to a team than a front 3 and the record he had was incredible. I would be worried about the fact he hasn't had a club job for years, it's pretty unconventional at the top but it might not make a difference.",Chelsea,Yes,jesgc4k,t1_jesdf3k

Gross was good for Ingolstadt and a key reason they got promoted, whilst Bissouma was a decent prospect before going to Brighton as a starter for Lille. Trossard scored 14 goals the season before Brighton signed him, it's not as though he was some underperforming player. This points to Brighton's recruitment generally being pretty good more so than Potter being a developmental coach, as we now see continued development under De Zerbi to a level above what Potter had achieved.",Chelsea,Yes,jetg53y,t1_jet8xub

"I‚Äôd always take the Barcelona managers with a pinch of salt. Enrique in particular had an unbelievable squad full of match winners and it‚Äôs difficult not do well with that Barca squad. All his experiences outside of Barca (before and after Barca) doesn‚Äôt help his case. 

Nagelsmann, on the other hand, may not have as many trophies but he took a near-relegated Hoffenheim to fourth place in the next season, and took RB Leipzig to UCL semi finals and with Bayern he won the bundesliga (which is not hard) and in the UCL played 8 and won 8, 27 scored, 2 conceded, clean sheets in the ties against PSG, Barca and Inter (despite losing Lewandowski). If he had stayed with Bayern, he‚Äôd surely have won quite a lot more. He‚Äôs young, he‚Äôs hungry, he‚Äôs articulate and passionate. He‚Äôs 35. At 28, he became the youngest manager in Bundesliga history. It‚Äôs no joke.",Chelsea,Yes,jercgqn,t1_jerc0qq
"His preferred formation is normally a 3-4-2-1. I don't think he's ever really varied from that. He has a fondness for using attacking wingbacks as a consequence(see, Filip Kostic before he left last summer), so I assume James could do well in his system.

He likes using these narrow winger types like Jesper Lindstrom, who sort of acts like a hybrid between your typical inverted winger and a number 10

In 2021/22, Frankfurt had a negative GD because of a shit defensive setup, they left a lot of gaps in defence, but it's gotten better. Although he still plays Tuta, who isn't that good tbh.

"Yeah, it's very important to have that ability at different stations in your passing patterns. In the clip above, for example, Nagelsmann specifically points out that he *wants* the RW (Gnabry) to be put under pressure by the opposing fullback to draw that player out. So he's counting on the ability of Gnabry to win this duel 1v1, and that requires good control under pressure and the ability to dribble out of it if needed. 

You're always attacking 10v11 in football (keepers aren't just jumping mannequins anymore), so separation has to be created at some stage in your patterns and dribbling is a great way to achieve that. The prolonged time a player holds on to the ball for will naturally attract other opponents around him, opening up space elsewhere. That's why Hazard was so ridiculously good despite never having the greatest G/A record - he would open teams up almost by himself, just because his dribbling was so good that he'd constantly draw in multiple opponents and find ways to bypass them even in the tighest spaces.",Chelsea,Yes,jermhqt,t1_jerl6mp

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the fringe Pulisic fans can have absolute garbage takes, but most of us are exceedingly harsh. Some of us have the balls to defend his few upper echelon traits, and not just cave to look unbiased, but acknowledge those positives have been mostly missing thanks to injury and inconsistency.

Instead of just having Pulisic/Ziyech/Mount/Havertz for our wide positions we now have those 4 plus Sterling, Madueke, Mudryk, Felix. At CB we've added premier league proven Fofana and one of the best young talents in Badiashile, not to mention Colwill coming on nicely. We've upgraded Jorginho with Enzo. I could go on. We have an embarrassment of riches in squad depth and only need a couple players to complete it.

"> ""However, on a tangent""


I find that with managers, you have to actually watch them to know what they're going to bring, I find the same thing with defenders and DMs as well tbh. So, I just sit back and hope that the scouting procedures are done correctly and that we hire the right man for the job, rather than just the person who is in the media at the moment. 



Having to think about the competency of the manager is new to me as well. I always trusted the old board to pick the right person and knew that if they didn't they'd make amends properly (they never fired 2 managers in a season, which shows that even when they fucked up it was only a small fuck up and not a Tuchel into Potter sized fuck up). So, I didn't really pay attention or try to judge managers before they were coming here, I just trusted them to do it and was super excited when anyone was announced



I did watch Spain at the world cup though and that scares me with regards to Enrique because they were fucking horrible. It was like Sarri on sleeping pills. 



We will have to see how it turns out I guess. We do have DoFs now though, so hopefully they pick someone that actually fits us this time and are allow to decide completely on their own who the best option is. You never know, maybe we get a non-English speaking curveball in there",Chelsea,Yes,jet07o1,t1_jesx3o2

"Everyone was praising lukaku when he joined and tuchel failed to implement him, it was a total failure from all involved but it was still a squad with rudiger and christensen and werner, where‚Äôs the upgrades?

Our defence was ok and the tendency to collapse under pressure is an inherent part of the group of players we‚Äôve had for a few years now. Maybe potter wasn‚Äôt the man but it‚Äôs ridiculous to say that this team should be doing much better right now, massive injury troubles, tons of new players and lots of unhappy faces. Plus a rabid fan base who were so incensed about tuchels firing that they were never going to give it a chance.

"We won the league back to back when Roman came in. Obviously I am willing to give it time and want to be proven wrong as much as any fan.

But after the decisions we have seen so far it‚Äôs fair to say Chelsea FC is not run as well as it was under Roman. It was not all rosy under Roman and mistakes were made with the centre backs and many other failed transfers like all clubs. But look at the shit show we‚Äôre in now, the win percentage is lower than it ever was under Roman.

It shouldn‚Äôt be a Roman vs Boehly thing because they both took over under different circumstances.

In 10 years, if Boehly wins as much as Roman did, is it really going to matter if it happened at the beginning or the end? And we should be realistic that kind of success is unlikely even with great management, especially given the parity of the league. You still need managers to work out, transfers to work and some luck.",Chelsea,Yes,jevjbto,t1_jeun552
"Yes there's a distinct difference in being happy that your right, and being happy he's gone, and being happy for both. But leading with I'm happy I'm right and you guys are wrong is inherently toxic, and also being happy he's gone doesn't change that. He gains nothing from being haha you guys were wrong and I'm right.

Forget the practicality of it all (a sack would be the most practical thing, but forget about it for a second). When was the last time you saw us come back from going 1-0 down to win a match?

When Cucurella made that mistake and Watkins scored, I knew right away that we had lost. Like I had said, it was like rewatching a movie for the 20th time; Villa would let us have the ball, and whenever we managed to get chances that look like high-quality chances - perhaps from a counter or from an Enzo/James diagonal - the box would be swarmed with Villa players, and the chance would diminish. This is the same issue Brighton had until De Zerbi and the Zerbi verticality came in. It was clear that from then we would huff and puff until the 90th minute.

And then the manager comes out to tell us (after losing 2-0 at home to Villa no less) that ‚Äúif we look at the xG of the goal, it‚Äôs not that big a chance.‚Äù Please. This reeks of an attempt to devolve responsibility to someone else. Under Roman, that‚Äôs a sackable comment. 

I‚Äôm just saying that if we want to recover some sort of spirit, we may have to restart our project.  Because the answer to ‚ÄúHow do you buy world-class players for 600m and end up mid table?‚Äù seems to be ‚ÄúYou hire a mid table manager.‚Äù",Chelsea,No,jen5zf6,t3_129amkd

"I can't even begin to imagine what ""turning it around"" would have to look like at this point for supporters to ever fully trust Potter. There's enough people out there who think Tuchel fluked the CL win and he was miles clear of Potter in everything else too. Potter has such a trust deficit to make up that I don't think can ever be overcome anymore. Every time we lose or draw, people will remember this dire period and question whether he's truly good enough. 

You'd have to think that even winning the CL this season won't do it for Potter (and rightfully so, imo). I'd say he'd probably get time into next season from the ownership and then have to start a title charge from day one of the new pre-season to at least silence the doubters temporarily. To do this, he'd have to massively improve his in-game management basically overnight. But he'd also have to win while integrating a bunch of young players or he'll never get the Cobham fans on side - they've already turned because failure is fine for them as long as you play the Cobham lads, and Potter isn't doing enough of that for their taste. A lot of supporters will also need him to change character in interviews and on the sideline to see a ""proper Chels"" manager in him. The list is basically endless by now. And anything but a title win will ultimately be met with the same doubts - is Potter really a winner, was the CL win just a fluke? 

But does *anyone* really believe that will happen? Potter's tenure has been so awful that even a far better manager than him would struggle to ever earn the supporters' trust after this.

It's time to just cut our losses and give a clean slate to a new manager. Ideally before the summer, because big decisions need to be made and the longer a new manager has to assess the squad the better. A massive clearout and smart recruitment in a few positions is needed, but not everyone we *can* sell should be sold if they have a role to play under a new manager. There's enough time on the training pitch between now and the end of the season for a new manager to make good progress. A change should be made before the Real Madrid tie - nobody is expecting us to beat them anyway, so losing that tie wouldn't reflect negatively on a new coach. But it does offer every chance of an ideal start to life.",Chelsea,No,jeot76i,t3_129amkd

There are lots of new fans here that joined around or since the CL win and the takeover. 


Those people will be just as knowledgeable about football as Boehly is and so when you see people on here justifying Potter getting more time, or praising him for ""underlying stats"" and blaming us just being unlucky or the ref etc. they're very likely to be making the same kind of potentially logically-sound arguments about why we should back him and why we should keep him. 


For anyone who has followed football for any period of time, they know that it's all nonsense. But, to people who are new it probably makes a lot of sense.

Auba (no word to say)

Sterling - personally I think he‚Äôs the among our best attackers. People tend to hate him and prefer Werner. But he‚Äôs alright. Better than Pulisic and Hakim and Mydryk imo. 

Kouli- he is alright. He made rash decisions at the beginning but now is getting better. He‚Äôs best suited to play as CB duo next to Fofana/Badi or at the center of 3 CBs at the back

Fofana - among our best defenders but rarely fit to play. Hope he show up more next season


Cucu - 1 good game every 10 bad games. He‚Äôs bought as backup for Chilly. Sadly, he‚Äôs even worse than Alonso 

Felix - was good at first, has good technical skills but now he‚Äôs alright. He presses when he feels like it and walks when he feels like it. I would rate Mount (at his peak 2 years ago) more than Felix. I was in favor of keeping him. Now I don‚Äôt think so 

Badi - among our best defenders

Mydryk - he‚Äôs alright. Tbh, he‚Äôs below my expectation of a 100m player - his first touch is subpar‚Ä¶

A complete rebuild was needed and was half completed in one window! And the obvious focus on outstanding young players is exactly the direction I wanted us to take, but still recognising the massive importance of academy grads (jury still out in this last point)



Given that Jan spending, we are 2 or 3 top players in key positions away from being a squad that should compete for the title. 

And for a while, accepting that we are building a hugely talented squad somehow compensated losing a truly world class manager, a grand master tactician and someone who moved Chelsea and was adored by the fans; a special relationship forged from guiding the club through unprecedented circumstances..

But that decision to fire Tuchel has once again been haunting my thoughts every now and then. It‚Äôs difficult to understand and you wonder why they really did fire him. Did they see his bond with the fans as a potential threat. 

What‚Äôs obvious is they were unfit to make that decision. With no structure in place at that point, what qualified them in any way to remove the man the supporters idolised. Did they not realise they‚Äôd hit the jackpot with Tuchel!? Did they understand he was an elite tactician? Did they even understand what tactics meant!?

Nagelsmann does provide more versatility but we're seeing how that works out. Someone HAS to come in and bring a fixed structure with defined roles. Once players are embedded into the basic system, then we can look at some versatility in that system. Enrique has already shown his desire to manage in the premier league and will also raise the technical roof of our team. He likes to provide a system where width is maximized, something I reckon will help the likes of Mudryk and Madueke.

It's time to move on with someone who is a certified winner and has experience managing a big club. I don't want nagglesman. Ultimately he's just a German potter who failed when he made the step up.

We want certified winners who can stand up to boehly. We keep on signing stupid players and wonder what is going wrong. A front 3 of murdyk Felix and havertz is not going to work.

Get Kai out of the team idc, play fucking Felix up top or something. He offers more and start Madueke for some creativity atleast. Kovacic is the least creative central midfielder we have, he does what he does really good but hes not the midfielder we need

The risk is of they don‚Äôt do well, shifting them will be impossible to make room for a new player.

"We simply aren't clinical even after the spend. Mudryk is raw af and looking more like a project than a win now player (not giving up on him). Felix, while good in other areas, continues to be very bad in the final 3rd, and really looking at his stats he's never been ultra clinical. Once he moved to atletico, he's not had a single higher scoring season than pulisic's best season at chelsea. Yes that can be attributed somewhat to atletico's style of play, but it doesn't automatically mean he'd have been lighting it up on a less defensive team, as evidenced by his play now. Kai is kai, he's inconsistent, talented, but not the individual talent to take over a game even from a finishing viewpoint on a consistent basis. Pulisic/mount are not anymore clinical.

Our chance creation has been decent, but with the finishing on our team, we can't expect to consistently score goals until the attacking patterns potter wants are mastered, which sadly can't be done in such a short time.

Potter making tactical mistakes here and there combined with our lack of finishing is costing us points. And even if he did get the tactics/subs/lineups consistently right, quite frankly due to our level defensively/goalkeeping-wise, we would still probably drop a fair amount of points.

I think we were way better than Aston Villa between the 2 Goals, the pressing was there, the attacking patterns were there. Our attackers just can't seem to make quick decisions and have a brain fart in the final third.

We conceded a worldie and Cucu gifted them the other. Mudryk missed a wide open Goal, 1 Goal was disallowed and we hit the post once as well. Other than that, so many good positions in the final third were wasted by our players.

Kovacic had so many chances and kept hitting the Row Z ( McGinn had 1 long shot and buried it)

Our DNA  dictated by the new ownership has changed and it hasn't finished changing. We're in a transition period. Some things are worse but there's a lot to be optimistic about.

Yes Potter hasn't cracked the new code yet. But we were never going to win this season tuchel or not because Tuchel himself knew going in that this is a rebuild season. Yes it was a stupid decision to fire tuchel. Firing Potter right now is just as stupid.

We've got a roster that's overblown and players who are unhappy because they're not getting minutes. That will only change at the end of the season. Yes were still in the same old small stadium but new management is actually for investing and changing that unlike Abramovich who was done investing once he got his visa revoked.

Things aren't great, they're also very complicated,
But crying about it and booing our own players ain't gonna change shit.",Chelsea,No,jen20rz,t3_129amkd

Really crazy stats that are coming out everyday. Yet there are people on here who think we played well and only a matter of time before Potter turns it around.,Chelsea,Yes,jeohuh1,t1_jenrw0o
Villa is all you need to shut up the trust the process idiots,Chelsea,Yes,jeoo5pd,t1_jeol38t
"Yeah, for a while I was in that camp. When he had some excuses. But I turned after the Southampton game. We were going backwards fast. Newcastle, Brighton, Brentford etc are great examples of why we needed a change.",Chelsea,Yes,jep2qmw,t1_jeol38t
Do you think he has any sense of embarrassment at all turning up for work?,Chelsea,Yes,jen0lnw,t1_jemxrao
"I was willing to give time and see whether Potter can turn it around but it's fucking April and we are looking worse and more lost than ever 

If he wasn't clueless, we would at least not underperform vs ducking Southampton who were last place

There is no sign of improvement, no patterns and no hope

I lost hope and I don't believe in him. If he proves me wrong I will be happy, but doubt he will have a chance. Could blame Reece and Chilly absence but both are playing and even Kante is back and still what? We lose to Villa at home after big transfer money injection",Chelsea,Yes,jempbkw,t1_jemowyi
"It‚Äôs correct to want to trust a process and to be patient to build for the future.

It‚Äôs not right to back an absolute clown.",Chelsea,Yes,jemp2hj,t1_jemowyi
"I was one of them. Willing to give time if there was improvement. Unfortunately, no one knows what their roles or positions are. I don't want this to continue next season.",Chelsea,Yes,jempo98,t1_jemowyi
"I was all for keeping Potter whilst there were no genuine, realistic upgrades on the market. 

Nagelsman and his RB connections seems to make total sense",Chelsea,Yes,jemwf1p,t1_jemowyi
"Was still willing to back Potter like 2-3 months ago because circumstances weren't easy. We had a lot of new players coming in, players were out injured, players were just returning from injury etc. But it's got to the stage where it's impossible to back him any longer.

The results have been atrocious - 6 wins and 11 defeats in the last 22 games in all competitions - and there's barely been any sort of improvement in the performances. He's had a fairly decent amount of time (he's gotten a fair few free midweeks) to work with the players but there hasn't been any sort of tangible appointment and it's hard to see what he's trying to achieve with the squad.

Like, what's the identity he wants to create with the squad? What are the good traits he has managed to instill? Even when things weren't going great under Tuchel for instance, we could at least recognize a few things that the team were good at (or at least decent at) - the pressing, the counter-pressing, the intensity, controlling the match, hard to score against etc.

Under Potter? The pressing has been disorganized, there's usually no control to games, the players some times look like they are running around like headless chickens, not hard to score against etc. It's ultimately impossible to back someone when that person hasn't shown anything to earn the patience or time in the job.",Chelsea,Yes,jemx4v9,t1_jemowyi
"I didn't want Tuchel gone and would have taken him back even in January just wanted to pre face this.

Though when do players get some blame? New manager bounce only goes so far.

Yesterday's game on paper without the goals we were so much better. 70% possession, 27 shots, half of those on target.

Yet AV have 2 shots on target 2 goals.

Our players situation awareness is terrible. It's just not good enough. Maybe that's down to training drills but what Mudryk did yesterday for instance was Sunday league type of shit. We have been in this situation for like 5 years now since Sarri. 

Is it out back room coaches? Didn't Potter bring all of his staff here?

Potter needs to address his subs and lineups last few games. They are bloody terrible even as someone not defending Potter but understanding of the injury situation we have had I don't think many would be different.",Chelsea,Yes,jen9sgg,t1_jemowyi
"Yup. All of this ""process"" thing came from Arsenal innit... I've never heard people talking about process to this extend before.",Chelsea,Yes,jeohnts,t1_jeogvjy
"We should dedicate long term to a manager who has earned something. The problem with Roman wasn't sacking someone like AVB too soon. It was not sticking by Jose in the dip his first run, or Carlo after he let the title slip in his second season. These guys clearly showed they could win with the squad.",Chelsea,Yes,jeojmup,t1_jeogvjy
Extremely brave to think we will beat liverpool,Chelsea,Yes,jemyxa2,t1_jemtkh9
They sacked Tuchel after a 5 minute meeting at 8am. Potter chats enough shit that a meeting starting at 8am could go on until tomorrow,Chelsea,Yes,jenc866,t1_jenbkpl

"2016 was the last time we‚Äôve been this diabolical, and under Hiddink I had accepted it was just to steady us for the rest of the season. It‚Äôs the hope that kills.

"Pretty much why while sacking Potter is the right idea, I‚Äôm not super excited about any manager right now. Even prime mourinho probably wouldn‚Äôt achieve any thing with these guys and their incredible footballing abilities both offensively and defensively",Chelsea,Yes,jenuxiv,t1_jenqysx

"Anyone who knows ball said this too. Your mate clearly knows ball. If potter wasnt english hed still be stuck in so no name swedish lower division club

The only reason there was so much hype around him isnt cos of his managerial abilty but cos hes english",Chelsea,Yes,jeo6tzq,t1_jeo5ogt
That he survived the Southampton game just makes me think he's not going anywhere until the end of the season.,Chelsea,Yes,jemtl1g,t1_jemo8jj

honestly this is the only thing we are capable of doing this season.,Chelsea,Yes,jeneave,t1_jenbkdc
"I think the squad is actually much more geared to something akin to Nagelsmann's football compared to Potter's defensive possession. However, every manager has intricacies, and it is hard to buy a whole squad and then try to figure out a manger after. But that's a mistake we have to live with at this point. There will probably be some expensive casualties who don't suit a new manager and more spending required no matter who we bring in. As far as Nagelsmann's ultimate ceiling, it's hard to say. I'm a bit on the fence about him.",Chelsea,Yes,jenybtu,t1_jenuque
"Tell me which other top coach is available? Nagelsmann has proved his worth with Leipzig, and was doing okay with Bayern. His problems happened with big ego alienation in dressing room. It's not as if his methods don't work. 

If Tuchel credited Nagelsmann's work. If he is good for Tommy Tactics, he's good for us.

Such a shame though. Nagelsmann was a Bayern fan. Tuchel loves Chelsea. If the transfers hadn't been fucked around, they'd be in their respective clubs.",Chelsea,Yes,jeo3kn6,t1_jenuque
"Lmao that's literally what the club did with Tuchel and we won the CL. 

Maybe the reason we didn't sack potter was because there wasn't someone clearly available. Now there is.",Chelsea,Yes,jenz2ch,t1_jenuque

"Tuchel said he got pulled in at 8, probs haven‚Äôt even had the talk yet. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm telling myself to get through this morning",Chelsea,Yes,jemu3lv,t1_jemss4s

"If Tuchel can be fired in 5 mins after that game, surely potter should also get the cut?

"Take a break mate. It won't happen today, I don't think so, as much as we want it too.",Chelsea,Yes,jen6i2i,t1_jen6alm
"Is Potter just daring Boehly to sack him so he can have a nice holiday? I mean, if Chelsea have better players than Villa, and the players ""gave their all"", then the problem is clearly the manager? Touch√© Potter.",Chelsea,Yes,jen9qgk,t1_jen8s4s
Curious who is considered as a ‚Äúkey player‚Äù in this team.,Chelsea,Yes,jenvp4v,t1_jenuu56
"I wouldn't be if I were you, they've just put his assistant in charge, so it'll likely be more of the same shit",Chelsea,Yes,jep27gw,t1_jep1kgi

"Man we could possibly win 3 of out remaining games, but honestly that is possible, not probable.

"I think if they‚Äôre gonna sack him then this loss against Villa is the perfect time, if they don‚Äôt do it now then I think he  stays till the end of the season.",Chelsea,Yes,jengdxd,t1_jend3e2
No better preparation than losing 2-0 at home to Villa.,Chelsea,Yes,jemlj4t,t1_jemlcil
"Cos the outflow would be all at once for his severance, and it‚Äôs already a high spend year. His contract is also abnormally high for his level, and the contract length is long.

"Very legit

"I said it in January I'd expect transfer requests from Enzo, Mudryk and a few others within 18 months without a new manager.

Top players don't want to be coached by a natural loser like Potter,  how can you go from winning a world cup and being hailed as the best young player in the world to being coached by a guy who's career achievement is once finishing 9th?",Chelsea,Yes,jeo5xtw,t1_jeo50ya
Has a track record on line up news. Unproven on everything else.,Chelsea,Yes,jeo68z0,t1_jeo50ya

"Sad to see him go, he seemed like a really nice guy but he never looked he was the right man  for this job. I expected things to take time but never thought it would be this bad, always wanted him to succeed but couldn't see any progress whatsoever. We were having the same issues as we had during tuchel and the managers before him, his in-game decisions were also questionable. 

With him gone now who is your top choice as the next manager? Not a lot available right now but given our directors are a bit familiar with naglesmann (that's what I read on twitter) do you think he is good enough to instill an identity into this team?",Chelsea,Yes,jep21lj,t1_jeot76i
"Meetings are ongoing I imagine. Get the sense that Clearlake would want to make sure they have a quality replacement (read: Nagelsmann) lined up before firing him, considering the reputational damage that they picked up from sacking TT.",Chelsea,Yes,jen5uqn,t1_jen5qvo

"150k a week that guy is on, almost double what Mount currently makes, it‚Äôs absurd. He has to go or take a pay cut. Dude is terrified to cross the ball in, just killed every attack we had on his side yesterday.",Chelsea,Yes,jeomz3v,t1_jeo6fe2
Zero clue in the final third. Will do the exact opposite of what he should be doing every single time,Chelsea,Yes,jeodnnb,t1_jeo6fe2
We have too many players making the worst decisions in the final third.,Chelsea,Yes,jeohofo,t1_jeo6fe2
Flick is not available. Germany play the Euros on home soil next year. There's no chance he leaves before then unless results get so bad that they have to kick him out - which would beg the question why one would then want him at Chelsea.,Chelsea,Yes,jenesoi,t1_jencot5
"Ange Postecoglou. I've watched this guy for nearly 20 years, he's the one, and until the squad is ready to win titles, the football he has his teams play won't have anyone worried about the wait.

Is he the manager that's going to turn this club into a title contender by matchday 1? No. Is he the guy to put faith in to guide a young, developing squad with an array of different talents into the beginning of a (dare i say it) dynasty in a few years time? Absolutely.",Chelsea,Yes,jenenux,t1_jencot5
Also didn't get midfielders. Bought one and that was it.,Chelsea,Yes,jenkg0s,t1_jenjae2
"Unbelievable really. 

We are soft as shit up front. Havertz gives the defenders absolutely nothing to worry about, they don‚Äôt even care that he is playing. Zero presence.

"To be frank Bayern players feel to me a bit spoiled, when something goes wrong they unionize and fire the coach instead of working it out with the coach

"There's this, and looking at the Arteta example without the context that he won 2 trophies in his first year which saved his job, and even then he was about 2 games away from the sack when it got really bad, he e.g. was saved by beating Chelsea.

"Backing up what you‚Äôve just said, the cultural shift on this sub has been immense.

"It was still a back 3 in possession in many ways, as Pavard stayed back a lot more than Davies who bombed forward. With us, he had 2 elite attacking fullbacks who were a massive part of our attack, and our DM was Jorginho who is the slowest, weakest and most immobile DM in the league. It‚Äôs very difficult to get your fullbacks forward that much with only 2 CB‚Äôs and Jorginho staying back. We could‚Äôve tried to sign a better suited DM of course, but still.

"Parts of your take are reactionary. 

>Cucurella provided a lovely assist for their first goal

Yes, he made a costly and avoidable mistake. But let's not pretend that he wasn't okay last night. Like I've observed about him, he's more of a conservative FB whose best attributes are tackling and intercepting. It is such a disservice to expect him to be an Alonso. He could be that deeper/inverted FB all day long. He won 9/12 duels yesterday. 

>Kai offers absolutely fuck all up top, he just jogs around and takes up space basically.

Basically, I have never been on his hype train for the majority of his time (even before he arrived). A player who doesn't press nor hound shouldn't have a business playing for a top team like Chelsea. His poor press led to the first goal yesterday. He is also poor at dribbling, shooting and creating. 

>play fucking Felix up top or something.

The best F√©lix can play centrally upfront is a 9/10 hybrid - Firminoesque. Therefore, he'd need inside runners (Mudryk, Madueke) to complement such tactical responsibility. 

>Kovacic is the least creative central midfielder we have, he does what he does really good but hes not the midfielder we need

I don't mind having Kovacic as a depth for Enzo. He offers the best resistance in our midfield. He occasionally displays instance brain farts but he isn't bad for cover. 

>Potter has to take responsibility for this loss, the starting eleven was absolutely shocking. Reece as a RCB is a crime against humanity, especially when you have 2 perfectly fine centre backs on the bench aswell

This. I saw no reason why Badiashile didn't play yesterday.",Chelsea,Yes,jendezv,t1_jen6sc3
"Kepa's awful and constantly concedes goals Nick Pope will save and make it look easy. Cucurella the idea of him works at LCB, he aggressively presses like Martinez does for United while the other CB covers but having one natural CB in a back three is nothing short of nonsensical.

Felix is equally as awful as Kai but he does flicks and tricks so people think he's some generational talent, fact is Mount has had more impact on the pitch than Felix has.

This loss is on him? Most of the losses are on him. Wacky tactics, no consistency in picking a first XI and excuse after excuse for why we lose. I think the idea of playing Cucurella there is because Cucurella needs to be match fit for the Real Madrid tie, us being the clowns we are bought players that would be cup tied due to panic loaning a forward who now has a grand total of 2 goals 0 assists in 11 appearances.

Leeds battered us for the last 35 minutes after Potter got his subs wrong and should have got at least a point only poor finishing let them down.

I don't feel we've been unlucky or the players have let us down, Potter has managed us for 31 games, we've won 6 were our Keeper wasn't man of the match we're absolutely shocking

Yeah.. we don‚Äôt concede that first goal if Badiashile plays lol,Chelsea,Yes,jemlndd,t1_jemlj4t
Gardening leave until he gets a new job. We don‚Äôt pay any severance at all then. I think that‚Äôs what happened with Conte.,Chelsea,Yes,jen0575,t1_jemz2pc
When does the football financial year finish? End of season? If we waited until then would we take the hit on his payout next year?,Chelsea,Yes,jen5b8l,t1_jemz2pc
Needs more output but the whole team is shit bar Enzo so it‚Äôs to judge too well imo. he‚Äôs got quick feet but nkunku coming in is the reason not to both for me,Chelsea,Yes,jenjrtz,t1_jene8y7

"Agreed, I feel bad for him too. Have nothing against him personally and I think he's a far better manager than he was ever able to show at Chelsea. Just seemed a misfit from day one.

>With him gone now who is your top choice as the next manager? Not a lot available right now but given our directors are a bit familiar with naglesmann (that's what I read on twitter) do you think he is good enough to instill an identity into this team?

I can't stand him personally, but he's a very good choice especially with the Vivell connection. My first choice would still be Enrique, but I'd be very happy with either. I'm not sure whether Nagelsmann is a long-term identity builder as he hasn't had to do it at Hoffenheim, Leipzig or Bayern, but his teams have been very good everywhere he's gone and that reflects well on him.",Chelsea,Yes,jep37q4,t1_jep21lj
"Sorry didn‚Äôt mean no payment, just a minimum payment. Like any normal job",Chelsea,Yes,jent9rw,t1_jenrrk0
"I remember at the start of the season when people like you were saying that there is no way we finish below spurs because we are Chelsea and being Chelsea means we get silverware every season and we finish above Spurs. 



Now, we are here. No silverware, way behind Spurs.



What exactly makes you think that if we continue to make awful decisions like massively overspending and hiring incompetent managers that we will just continue to be the club we used to be? 



You don't just get success because your name is Chelsea and you spend money. You have to earn it from top to bottom, if we don't change pretty much everything Boehly has put in place, then we will be changed permanently. It's crazy that people can't understand that we don't have a god given right to be the club we used to be under proper ownership",Chelsea,Yes,jenm81j,t1_jenk6s4
"There's no guarantee that we will be. Bigger clubs have had takeovers that have ultimately led to their regression ‚Äì just look at Man Utd.

He's a complete and utter black hole for anything in attack. It's weird because he will do one brilliant move or flick that gives me hope and then he crushes it by following it up with 5 stupid decisions.,Chelsea,Yes,jeoe1mb,t1_jeodnnb
"> which would beg the question why one would then want him at Chelsea.

Because he has won the sextuple with Bayern with insanely dominating footy, if it didn't work out at international footy then that just means he needs his time and right personnel.",Chelsea,Yes,jenexxd,t1_jenesoi
We also shipped off our most defensive minded mid fielder and did nothing to fill in the gap. I really wanted to see a Jorginho - Enzo - Joao mid field.,Chelsea,Yes,jensfbt,t1_jenkg0s

I just hope it‚Äôs not Pochettino.",Chelsea,Yes,jemzyod,t1_jemzr4w
"Meanwhile Felix has no assists and has 2 goals in 11 appearances, the so called player who can see a pass doesn't have a single assist for us.",Chelsea,Yes,jenwijk,t1_jenrvdy

Would call that dominating.",Chelsea,Yes,jemymzf,t1_jemwv6s
"Disagree and I said at the time. Even if we didn‚Äôt have a natural LW, we had a plethora of attacking midfield/frontline options. Instead we put faith in Fofana‚Äôs poor fitness, a 38yo who had played a hell of a lot of minutes at that stage, and Koulibaly who‚Äôs form has looked better since but was looking bad at the time. To me the only ration behind going for Mudryk over Badiashille was the fact that he was deemed a ‚Äòstar signing‚Äô and Badiashille wasn‚Äôt",Chelsea,Yes,jen3o0r,t1_jen13ch
"Not defending our form but you could say similar to both previous times we won the CL. Seeing as we‚Äôre definitely not getting it through your league position, our razor slim chances of winning the CL matters even more than usual.

"Could be, but he needs a partner. Look what other teams achieved with a good attacking duo: Lampard & Drogba; Osimhen & Kvara; Kane & Son; Mane & Salah; KdB & Haaland; Lautaro & Lukaku and the list can go on.

"Yeah, yeah. 



When I said that all of this shit was going to happen 10 months ago, you called me a xenophobe. Then it all happens and rather than admit that I clearly could see the writing on the wall, you continue to put it down to xenophobia

">It was still a back 3 in possession in many ways,

As are most back 4 systems, but they ultimately have an extra technical/offensive player in the side vs a team that lines up in a back 3/5 with natural fullbacks/wingbacks. 

Tuchel didn't even seem to think we needed a midfielder until we had injury issues towards the end of the last summer transfer window. That's on him. He signed someone like Cucurella because he could supposedly play LCB in a back 3 too - despite him being shit offensively which meant he's a downgrade on Alonso and Emerson as a LWB too. 

>Potter yesterday put both of those elite fullbacks into the back 3 at the end when we desperately needed attacking prowess, lmao.

With James there's the workload management thing I guess, I was utterly baffled when he pulled Chilwell back lol he was one of our best attacking outlets all game and was enjoying getting on to passes into the final third. Not sure if he was gassed or anything, but anyway at that point the game was basically done and dusted.",Chelsea,Yes,jemura7,t1_jemu58z
Chilwell is good but he's no Davies. Davies is a true wingback.,Chelsea,Yes,jemupe9,t1_jemu58z
I don't think world class tacticians need to watch PL games for tactical guidance,Chelsea,Yes,jemx6as,t1_jemu1xq
Lol you are delusional. 2 games against Real a few years ago. Ukrainian Yaya Sanogo,Chelsea,Yes,jenwy3d,t1_jenwi8x
"Lol mudryk is basically Timo Werner with worse finishing and somehow an even worse first touch. 

He also didn't get played as a striker and even if he did he should show more than the consistent disasterclasses he's offering.

Doing well for shaktar doesn't mean you'll do well for Chelsea. Our manager is bad and should have been sacked in the Jan window but that doesn't mean Mudryk is good either.

Edit: Also to the fucking clown who said mudryk played at striker here's his position 
https://www.whoscored.com/Matches/1640941/MatchReport/England-Premier-League-2022-2023-Chelsea-Aston-Villa

Quite clearly he's playing next to Chilwell on the left who was high and wide overlapping. We haven't used an actual striker in the game because Havertz drifts right and Felix drops deep. But mudryk quite clearly wasn't playing as a striker. Wide 10 maybe but not striker.",Chelsea,Yes,jenx3g6,t1_jenwi8x
But its not Mudryk‚Äôs fault Todd decided to splash 100m,Chelsea,Yes,jeoikzo,t1_jeohfpq
Mendy saves 90% of them...,Chelsea,Yes,jenlwlc,t1_jengpvt
But Potter isn't the point of my comment. It's Nagelsmann. Nagelsmann gets away with a lot because he managed in the Bundesliga and he's young. People will realise he has a lot of developing to do if he comes here.,Chelsea,Yes,jemucua,t1_jemu4vw
"Nagelsmann might communicate on the field but off the field, his communication is not that good which will eventually lose to broken player-manager relationships, you know the rest.",Chelsea,Yes,jemu0gj,t1_jemt4cw
Our fanbase doesn't understand the meaning of a process nor do they possess the patience to go through one unfortunately.,Chelsea,Yes,jemuhuw,t1_jemu9uj
there is a huge gap between immediate success and being fucking 11th,Chelsea,Yes,jemxxyq,t1_jemtu2i
"If there was a clear identity and plan in place from the manager it makes it a lot easier to back them. When Klopp took over at Liverpool you could see what he wanted to do same with Pep at City so you afford them time, unfortunately for Potter there just isn't an identity there",Chelsea,Yes,jen1rv8,t1_jemtu2i
Murdyk is still young and so is Mauduke....we can retrain them to be effective in half spaces especially considering the dribbling and space both have...they can rotate with Nkuku/Sterling/Felix and play inside forwards like Salah/Mane? Where they are effective coming in,Chelsea,Yes,jen64ts,t1_jen5j10
"As unpopular as this opinion is, Mudryk occupying wingback spots is deadly. Imagine Mudryk/Madueke in the positions that RLC was getting against Villa. Deadly combination.",Chelsea,Yes,jenq8gs,t1_jenp11w

Once again to these guys who don't watch the actual games we don't create chances so we don't score. Yes Mudryk could have probably won us the game but our team don't create chances as a whole. Which makes it even more beautiful that our main chance creators the last 3 seasons were playing at CB.",Chelsea,Yes,jeo03gp,t1_jenlpxn
"I do watch other teams.  But based on eye test and Xg vs Actual, we are bad at finishing.  Just look at yesterday.  Chelsea had 24 shots to AV‚Äôs 6 and an xG of 2.77 to their .77.

Lol this is so delusional it's actually funny,Chelsea,Yes,jeol5nh,t1_jeoby7t
Leipzig had great players at his time there,Chelsea,Yes,jen1eey,t1_jen16vc
Boehly has a lot of bootlickers who think he saved us even though we had a lot of people wanting to buy us. Unfortunately he‚Äôs not going anywhere but he needs to fuck off and let the football guys run the club and stop being so involved,Chelsea,Yes,jencnxc,t1_jen4zjq
"Completely agree, but even if potter asked them to stop do you think they‚Äôd listen? They‚Äôre clearly extremely difficult to work with, potter is not a shit manager, he did better at brighton than he did here. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs at the level we want to be at, but boehly is the main problem

Seriously why the fuck is he still always around? He knows nothing about football literally zilch, sacked tuchel, cech, marina. All who were popular among chelsea fans. Brings in his own football guys, fair enough let them run the club. But no he‚Äôs STILL CONSTANTLY THERE??? And he keeps interacting with fans on Twitter and liking tweets, we might as well have fucking Elon musk in charge and honestly I think he would do better, not even joking",Chelsea,Yes,jenboyy,t1_jen5ncp
I would rather make miminal signings and have Potter leave,Chelsea,Yes,jene3vz,t1_jencon6
"He's miles ahead of Nagelsmann in terms of what WE need. 

We need someone who's going to bed in a structure and idea. Nagelsmann is just gonna switch it every few games.",Chelsea,Yes,jemon8p,t1_jemo4ff
"Rigidity is required at this time imo. We've had back to back 'flexible' managers. 

Working in a national team at coaching at club football are two very different things. Plus he actually got them to the semi finals which is not a small achievement imo.",Chelsea,Yes,jemn14n,t1_jemm59i
"No. Nagelsmann is known for his flexibility. He does switch between systems and structures. He Especially likes a back 3. Then also a 4-2-2-2, he'll switch a lot. 

If you want someone to implement a back 4 then Enrique is the man.",Chelsea,Yes,jemnyps,t1_jemnn3a
Disagree. No more 'flexibility' for me. Instill a proper fucking philosophy and structure. Plus our wingers will be sold in no time when Nagelsmann comes. Or he'll misprofile them.,Chelsea,Yes,jemnub9,t1_jemnkm8
"For me te football with Tuchel was bad and showed no signs of improvement. I think for maybe 9 months we just weren't getting it right. Anyway he's gone now, we have to make the right decisions",Chelsea,Yes,jemriic,t1_jemr2uc
He has more season managing a top club than Pep had when he took over Barcelona,Chelsea,Yes,jemyqp6,t1_jemr2uc
"he managed bayern munich, one of europes top 5 clubs. what else should he do to get appptoved as ""experienced in managing a big club""?",Chelsea,Yes,jen1sqn,t1_jemr2uc
Then we should pay him to fuck off like arsenal did. No room for mediocrity that too with that insane wages. My god. He's absolutely ass. Cucurella is even worse. YUCK ü§¢ü§¢,Chelsea,Yes,jemyn9r,t1_jemqw5m
So now I'm a plastic because my opinion differs from yours?,Chelsea,Yes,jenh4u8,t1_jengx0z
Calling someone a plastic for having a harmless opinion is such a waste.,Chelsea,Yes,jeol4ro,t1_jengx0z
We got unlucky and that is also part of potter fault for playing stupid 3atb line up. But overall we attacked really well and dominated the game.,Chelsea,Yes,jen2bql,t1_jen28yz
"Also teams just sit back and let chelsea have the ball because they know nothing will come of it, yet fans here think just because chelsea ""dominate"" possession there is progress.",Chelsea,Yes,jen6jgs,t1_jen4ddr

"Yes I agree that is stupid. But everyone make mistake, even tuchel make bonehead mistake. 

However, overall our shape and attacking has been really good.

I'm not a potter fans, I was saying we were bad even when we were winning against Milan back to back. But for now are actually looking good, just the doesn't show it in the result in the last two game.",Chelsea,Yes,jen2gio,t1_jen2cwy

"The season is already over for us, except for maybe a UCL miracle. 

I will get a lot of downvotes for saying this since everyone's patience is already thin but IMO we should stick with Potter as we have already invested a lot of money in this project. New interim / permanent manager won't have the same vision that Potter has with these sets of raw players and their development might get worse or stagnant. Stick with Potter, and if by early next season he still doesn't produce, it's time for the sack.

It‚Äôs a bit harsh considering most of the team is shit right now and we are regressing. We also have no system in place and next to no continuity from week to week in the starting XI. Oh and we are playing him as a striker.  The situation he came into is far less than ideal.,Chelsea,Yes,jen0whw,t1_jemvgub
"We've deffo overpaid but the system and style of football will never allow a player like Mudryk to thrive.

"agreed, remember when Lampard took over we were hit by transfer ban & lost our best player in Hazard, yet we still finished 4th that season.

"Thank you, I knew I'd get down voted and get snide silly comments. I don't care in the slightest. Yours was the only one that was respectful and opinionated and the only one deserving a reply

Plenty of managers didn't win anything before they won for the first time. Tuchel won the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 where the competitions was at the time, pitiful so not really a big achievement . He didn't win the UCL with neither but we still brought him  and lo and behold he won the champions league with our dregs. The fact he was fired for no reason was maddening but that's in the past and no one can change it. 

I'm not saying I'm hedging all my bets on an unproven manager, I'm saying there's new management and they're quite happy to let this season ride giving potter a chance to find his legs.

Arsenal did the same thing almost two years and are now reaping the rewards. Does that mean the same would happen with us? It could, it could also not happen.

But evidently Boehly isn't a trigger happy owner like Abramovich was and if they wanted to fire him they would've done so months ago..

So despite what any of the fans think management just gonna do what they want and personally knowing this season was in the muck before it started, I'm giving both potter and Boehly the benefit of the doubt until June",Chelsea,Yes,jenhsqk,t1_jen2eqp

There are players dude no doubt but why should we be spending 1 billion to get the players who can make a difference while others are signing some players for less and getting value?

"I'd be wary of that. Flick was already part of the dressing room at Bayern and knew the club really well. The players loved him. To me Flick at Bayern is a bit like Terzic at Dortmund, I'm not sure he'd be anywhere near as good elsewhere. He did really well there but it always felt to me that he just went back to what the players were used to after Kovac tried too hard to imprint his own stuff that wasn't working.",Chelsea,Yes,jenfem3,t1_jenexxd
International management is much easier than club management,Chelsea,Yes,jenfa1y,t1_jenexxd
"Tbh we needed to upgrade on Jorginho with a proper defensive midfielder and not just do a swap with Enzo who's clearly better with freedom in midfield.

Also part of the problems in midfield is that we are going to run in FFP trouble soon.",Chelsea,Yes,jenwqd1,t1_jensfbt
"Tactically rigid, headstrong, no Plan B. Was only ever successful with MSN era Barca. No thanks.",Chelsea,Yes,jen1wjt,t1_jemzyod
Because he has more experience than Flick and is actually available in the market.,Chelsea,Yes,jen0suv,t1_jemzyod
I feel we should go for a modern manager given the squad is pretty young. How about Amorim?,Chelsea,Yes,jen0hd5,t1_jemzyod
He links midfield and attack better than mount ever could,Chelsea,Yes,jenznys,t1_jenwijk
"Talking about this year mate, they didn‚Äôt sack him last year

A padded room and a 72 hour evaluation might be more appropriate.,Chelsea,Yes,jeo654q,t1_jenjfss

He blooded a lot of them in though.,Chelsea,Yes,jen1s32,t1_jen1eey
"FFP means we have to sell players regardless, players who are hard to shift, this is a big issue. How do we shift Pulisic when he's injury prone and will be free the next summer? Newcastle could take a punt on him but they'd rather do it for free e.g. 

We have to end up selling players like Mount for a cheaper price too because again, he could go for free if he doesn't sign. I think Havertz is a similar situation.

Board have done an astronomical fuck up money wise, we probably thought there was a long term plan and this would make us best team in the league in 2-3 years but also if it goes horribly wrong we now have an expensive team, lots of money spent, unable to amortise contracts for a long period of time.",Chelsea,Yes,jeneoig,t1_jene3vz
"Nagelsmann has a very defined set of ideas, and a lot of structure, what are you talking about?",Chelsea,Yes,jemxceh,t1_jemon8p
"Pep is flexible, and he‚Äôs the greatest manager of all time. Flexibility isn‚Äôt the issue.",Chelsea,Yes,jemo41c,t1_jemn14n
"What is Enrique going to require to implement it though? I assume Enzo is fine, and so too are the full-backs and defence.

What does he likely need in midfield and attack?

Also does he have any experience bringing in younger players or did he achieve success with lining up older top tier players?",Chelsea,Yes,jemo4gi,t1_jemnyps
">No. Nagelsmann is known for his flexibility. He does switch between systems and structures. He Especially likes a back 3. Then also a 4-2-2-2, he'll switch a lot.

Problem with that is the Bayern players didn't like that. They felt that Nagelsmann's penchant for changing systems made things confusing and contributed to uneven performances.",Chelsea,Yes,jemvu7s,t1_jemnyps
"I think nagelsmann would work wonders with james and chillwell

I think he would work very well with nkunku, enzo and  kante.",Chelsea,Yes,jemo34e,t1_jemnub9

"Not to get into the who is or isn't plastic etc, it is pretty weird to say you wanted Potter succeed more than Lampard. If there's any manager I wanted to succeed it was Lampard, would've been amazing.",Chelsea,Yes,jenhlg6,t1_jenh4u8
"Such a weird stance to have to defend. Ofc you'd want potter to do better than lampard because lamps never won anything. 

Too many people online are fixated on personas or narratives rather than the club. Chelsea is what matters. Fuck tuchel, fuck potter, fuck lampard. It's about Chelsea football club doing well.

Same thing with players, tired of it",Chelsea,Yes,jenvoiu,t1_jenh4u8
"You're a plastic because you most likely started supporting the club when Boehly came in and wanted to support a bum like Potter over people who actually got the culture of the club and bled Blue.

When does it stop being about luck and starts being about lack of ability?",Chelsea,Yes,jen4sw3,t1_jen2bql
"3 atb with cucu and Reece isn‚Äôt bad. No one complained about it when they saw the starting lineup. Cucu put on very good games at lcb recently.

Potter is that you?,Chelsea,Yes,jen6agj,t1_jen2bql
"We were good at attacking under Lampard as well, but he still should've been fired. Also making  barely any progress in 8 months is not a good enough progress. Managers that are elite improve their players, Potter hasn't improved anyone yet, so the whole ""Potter ain't at fault for us not scoring our chances"" is not really true cuz he is the guy who should be fixing these problems.

Also Villa were really bad defensively, when we face a proper team that's solid in midfield and defense we will get exposed even more.",Chelsea,Yes,jen2yk8,t1_jen2gio
Real dont want to sack carlo. Carlo is retiring,Chelsea,Yes,jen5142,t1_jen4t5d

In reality they're probably as bad as each other but Felix is more expensive. Not as bad as buying Mudryk though.",Chelsea,Yes,jenfhme,t1_jend8gq
"Potters tatics are ass, we spent 55 mins playing mostly through the rw to have RLC  do nothing but dribble himself and then do a garbage cross, it doesn't matter if we have the ball, we do the same shit. Pass,pass,pass, cross to no one, reset.",Chelsea,Yes,jemlwfx,t1_jemlgu5
"More like mudryk missed 2 alone with the goalkeeper

Joao missed 1 sitter and missed the goal from 6 yards

Kante! missed the goal twice in good positions 

Then we had chillwells world class play, k2 getting fouled (should have been a penalty)

And the ref calling everything and nothing.

We where class yesterday, but 1 individual misstale and one screamer later... and we cant score to save our life",Chelsea,Yes,jemns7t,t1_jemmmdy
"Keeping Potter long term is out of the question. Fuck his ‚Äúproject‚Äù, he has been the worst Chelsea manager since the 90s with the most investment. Potter is yet to do something that shows he‚Äôs the man for the job, so why keep Chelsea as a joke of a club up until he throws away next season as well.

The advantage of sacking Potter now is that we could at least get something. It‚Äôs a lot easier to recruit players (and keep the ones u already have) with a manager that they will trust and a decent run of form in ur pocket regardless of position. As well as that, for our fire sale to work then we need our players to actually look decent, which they haven‚Äôt under Potter.",Chelsea,Yes,jenpnf5,t1_jen0oes

Yea 100%,Chelsea,Yes,jemvh0y,t1_jemv8hc
"Yeah, I‚Äôd take Pochettino. I think he‚Äôd be a long term appointment. Conte would be interesting with this owner. They both love throwing cash at things‚Ä¶he‚Äôs a winner, even if his football is a bit dull.",Chelsea,Yes,jemx5yu,t1_jemtk05
It‚Äôs aight Sterling and Wesley should be back meaning more danger from the start and better chance creation from wing back. 3-0 for the blues,Chelsea,Yes,jen6b4p,t1_jen4v21

Last year we scored 9 goals less than our last title winning season.,Chelsea,Yes,jenzjnn,t1_jenyf9u
"Well it obviously does count for something when we have a scattering of trophies, one being the UCL, over the last few years. Shows the difference top managers can make, they find a way to get results.",Chelsea,Yes,jeo04hc,t1_jenyf9u
"Imo I think it‚Äôs very wrong that our club embraces the chaos culture that was set in the Abramovich era. The reality is we‚Äôve been fortunate that cutthroat culture paid off. We‚Äôre seeing evidence at present it may not, and the new owners are on very thin ice imo. We‚Äôve spent 600 million and we are gonna be looking at a long road ahead if we don‚Äôt get things right next season with or without Potter. If we sack him and hire a new coach honestly the expectation should be to win the title. No excuses considering the investment. Top 4 would be undoubtedly great cause it gets us back CL football but it would be embarrassing for us to finish top 4 next season when it looks likely we will play one game a week. 

I just don‚Äôt want us becoming like Everton and then getting screwed by financial restrictions. Hopefully my concerns are proven wrong and the board‚Äôs planning does pay off because with every day it just looks more concerning. I have supported this club for nearly 20 years and that‚Äôs not changing ever. I just want to see us back where we belong",Chelsea,Yes,jeo14us,t1_jenzab8
"Bruh maybe you‚Äôre okay with us winning a CL like that. I want to see us challenging for every title and winning one or two while doing that, maybe even more. That‚Äôs how a club of our stature should be and that‚Äôs how Manchester City have been the past 6 years, like the old Chelsea teams of the early years of Roman. I‚Äôm absolutely proud that we have 2 CLs but I constantly wish how amazing it would be to see us win a treble or win the CL with a league as a double. And that is something we‚Äôre miles away from.",Chelsea,Yes,jeo0by2,t1_jenzab8

"Yeah. Honestly AVB was better and he was very dislikeable but you had an idea of what he was doing, just that his squad was ageing and lacking quality and consistency.

What triggered me the most was this clown sitting down dejected with no ideas against villa.

Losing to villa probably was the best outcome, could not spend another day with this clown in charge.",Chelsea,Yes,jepng30,t1_jep3rax
"It doesn't matter if you think he'll immediately light up the league, having three expensive players for the same position is bad squad management",Chelsea,Yes,jeq3nhg,t1_jenph8z
[deleted],Chelsea,Yes,jeoiy9z,t1_jeogvqh
"I find that hard to predict because he's taken over clubs that already had certain styles before him (very Rangnick-influenced at Hoffenheim and Leipzig, basically set with the same core at Bayern since Pep), but his teams have always attacked well and he's made intelligent tweaks to them that improved them and certain players. Werner had his best season under Nagelsmann, for example, and that was at least partially due to a tweak in his role that saw him drop deeper into midfield and start his runs from there so that he would be running at full speed as he attacked the last line. I would be hoping for things like that, but also a clear overall identity. 

What I'm not super happy about is that he's yet another manager who likes a back 3 setup. We simply need to leave that behind for good. We face deep blocks all the time and need to create, and the extra CB is completely unnecessary most of the time. Defending hasn't been an issue for us in a back 4 this season, we simply need to get better going forward with it. Recruitment needs to address any needs we feel might keep us from setting up that way. 

Tuchel also had his issues with our attack and a lot of them were similar. It's time we finally rip that up and start something new with the new forwards we have now. Mudryk, Madueke need to play as actual wingers, not inside forwards that enable wingbacks to be the wide men. It's a complete waste of their best attributes (dribbling, pace). Nkunku's best role is as a second striker or 10 (same as Havertz) so that probably leaves us with a 4231 as our best system going forward imo. I could also see him play false 9, but not sure if that's something we want. Either way, the job now is a very different one than it was for Tuchel who was handed basically a full squad, very few attacking transfers (messed up with Lukaku) and a bunch of players we know aren't good enough. The next manager will have to piece together all the new players (and summer transfers too) into a coherent team. It really is a building exercise now.",Chelsea,Yes,jep7b1r,t1_jep48lx
We definitely need to create something from central areas in attack. You can tell there's no cohesion or anticipation there because guys have to continually stop and survey because they don't know where anyone will be until they send it out wide.,Chelsea,Yes,jep500q,t1_jep48lx
"Do you think a coach like Sarri can work out in international management when he requires his time to instill patterns?

Same is the case with coaches like Flick, they need their consistent time with the squad.",Chelsea,Yes,jenfgf5,t1_jenfa1y
Young managers aren't necessary for a project.,Chelsea,Yes,jen0rtl,t1_jen0hd5
his job is to assist and score goals because they win games not to play sexy football.,Chelsea,Yes,jeo1yn2,t1_jenznys
Read the comment again. They‚Äôre talking about being bad in the league whilst being on a CL run. Our league form obviously wasn‚Äôt this bad but it wasn‚Äôt close to being as good as our CL form was. 2 different beasts,Chelsea,Yes,jens3fu,t1_jen6sqp
"Unrelated question: when did you start watching football? :)

But seriously though. This is off-the-charts unlikely, for someone who has watched football for more than five years to favour Arsenal against City. Is it *okay* if a CFC fan wants our direct rival Arsenal to win the PL after we haven't won it in over five years? Yes. Does it make sense? No.",Chelsea,Yes,jeomut9,t1_jeokmhk
"Right, but that doesn't mean they are going to blatantly copy the tactics of PL managers exclusively.

The tactics you are describing are not the tactics of the last few CL winners, for example.",Chelsea,Yes,jen19tz,t1_jemxvj4
"This is probably the most unpopular opinion on the sub probably but I think if Reece doesn't fix up, Gusto will easily bench him. He's much more dynamic that Reece. 

As outstanding as you think Chilwell is, and he is tbf, especially at receiving progressive passes, making runs etc, he's not very explosive like Davies. He's not going to run past his man and then cut back very effectively. 

That's where Nagelsmann's 3-2-4-1 with Mudryk at LM might come into play. 

>I see several problems with that

What problems do you see? Keep in mind, it's just a wingback position when we have possession. Without possession, he'd play as a LM/LW with someone covering behind him.",Chelsea,Yes,jeo0z4g,t1_jenxduz
If you have to reference last year to prove your point then that says it all really. Mount this year has been one of our worst finishers and that is really saying something,Chelsea,Yes,jens72v,t1_jenrp7o
"He's incredibly flexible. Anyone you ask about Nagelsmann, they'll mention flexibility to you, without fail.",Chelsea,Yes,jemzh7s,t1_jemxceh

Pep always instills a basic philosophy at his clubs first. Then he looks at changing things now and then.",Chelsea,Yes,jemok0d,t1_jemo41c
"No matter which manager we bring, a Midfield revamp is necessary. He'll require technical Midfielders who can move the ball very well and not panic under pressure. They need to keep moving as well. Every modern team should have this imo. 

>Also does he have any experience bringing in younger players or did he achieve success with lining up older top tier players?

If you look at Enrique's Spain team, there weren't many top tier players. He did rely on the likes of Pedri, Olmo, Garcia, Simon during the Euros. 

Also, Enrique is not afraid to bench players that don't fit the overall team philosophy. Famous example- David De Gea. 

In attack, I think he can do good work with Mudryk and Madueke. Striker is a question mark, maybe he uses Nkunku there.",Chelsea,Yes,jemp3rn,t1_jemo4gi

He used a 4222 as well no?,Chelsea,Yes,jen1ma6,t1_jen16dd
"4-3-3. He did that at Barca and the same for Spain. 

He used Suarez up top for Barca and moved Messi out wide at Barca. Spain doesn't have very good strikers but he's used Morata, Moreno.",Chelsea,Yes,jempovr,t1_jempagf
"We don't have good traditional wingers? What üòÇ

Mudryk and Madueke are excellent traditional wingers. But they don't get played in the right positions. 

>2 of the top 5 wingbacks in the world the better.

Neither Reece nor Chilwell are proper wingbacks. I'd take Davies over Chilwell any day. Chilwell simply doesn't possess the explosiveness required. His main redeeming quality are his runs in behind. But even Mudryk can do that, and he's much faster than Chilwell so he'll have even more time. 

Reece also isn't explosive. Well he was a bit, but he's not shown it this season. He's a proper fullback. Bookmark it, you'll see the difference when Gusto comes in.",Chelsea,Yes,jemu9q4,t1_jemtawv

"So the question begs, how do you know the next person is the right hire? Because it‚Äôs impossible to predict.

"I suggested it; you implied it.

I said that it doesn't make sense for a CFC fan of more than five years to want our direct rival Arsenal to win the PL after we haven't won it in over five years. Any CFC fan. I don't know if he's a CFC fan of more than five years, and without that foreknowledge I could not have possibly criticised them.

We can keep going with this but this conversation is not going to yield anything fruitful as long as you keep trying to find holes in my comments while failing to plug those in yours. Regardless, I will enjoy further conversation, but if - especially with your ""give me a break"" - you find this stressful, I'm happy to just end it here with this: There's no one by the gate preventing anyone from being a CFC fan. If you make comments that suggest that you are not a CFC fan, then I may question without suspicion of ill intent how long you've been a fan. If your answer suggests that you have been a fan for more than three to five years, then I have to either rethink my prior beliefs or ask further questions to learn about your priors. Otherwise, I will understand your position, not continue conversation, and wait until your position inevitably changes.

Now if a bystander decides to accuse me of gatekeeping via faux questions, I will wear the bystander down until they lack the energy to further continue the conversation.",Chelsea,Yes,jeowu5p,t1_jeotxdc
"Yes, makes sense. That's what I've gathered from Enrique's work. One thing is that he likes to play his team in a way that it's set up very wide and pressing high with a high line is also really important for Enrique.",Chelsea,Yes,jemrhra,t1_jempykw

You really couldn't come across as more of a pretentious blowhard than this.",Chelsea,Yes,jeozpsl,t1_jeowu5p
I‚Äôm kinda hoping for someone like Mourinho at the moment. Sadly Tuchel was perfect in that regard. We need someone who can take this squad by the scruff of their necks and impose their authority. Most of these guys seriously need to be made to fear for their spot  the team the way they‚Äôre underperforming. All this while I‚Äôve been frustrated about the results but kept hoping that we‚Äôll turn it around. Seeing potter clapping when our players fluffed chances vs Villa felt like the last straw for me.,Chelsea,Yes,jeo30y5,t1_jeo2mle
"Good. Now let us accept that you had no further contribution than to resort to insulting me, that the goal of my interaction with said bystander has been accomplished, and end the discussion. Cheers!",Chelsea,Yes,jep0mze,t1_jeozpsl
Problem is finding a manager who will keep the players on their toes and make them raise their standards without being a complete psycho.,Chelsea,Yes,jeo4z2u,t1_jeo30y5
The discussion was ended when you said your goal was to wear me down until I lacked the energy to further continue the conversation. What contribution can someone possibly make to that?,Chelsea,Yes,jep1u5q,t1_jep0mze
True that is easier said than done. I‚Äôm impressed by how Ten Hag has fared so far at United. Handled the Ronaldo drama pretty well.,Chelsea,Yes,jeo53fh,t1_jeo4z2u
"Okay; my apologies. Assume that that wasn't my goal, and that the intention of my comment was to successfully intimidate you into quitting while I was busy with something else. What would your further contribution be?",Chelsea,Yes,jep264p,t1_jep1u5q
"Nah we are past that point. You tried to push your weight around with a new fan that didn't pass your fandom test. Then you tried to do the same thing to me. It's classic bully behavior. You are set on having the last word, and I don't let bullies get the last word. I'm sick with the flu and in bed all day. I got time. What has been your contribution here besides jumping in to put someone down?",Chelsea,Yes,jep2qvn,t1_jep264p
"Oh wow; I'm down with a cold too man! Really going around these days. Luckily we *both* have time, so let's dissect your comment.

The antecedent that I am a bully here is quite false.

1. I explained the intention behind my question to the original commenter and what I would have done given a response. I didn't try to push any weights around.
2. I really haven't tried to push my weight around with you; all your arguments have just been quite poor. *You* have attempted this by insulting me and repeatedly dismissing my oppositions to your arguments.
3. Classic bully behaviour. Oh my days. Ah well...
4. With *you*? Yes, I'm set on having the last word. My comment history will reveal that I too make poor arguments from time to time, and that I am eager to compromise. If you make a single good argument here without resorting to insults, I will compromise despite how poorly you've acted so far. Otherwise, I will not.
5. It is generally a good thing to not let bullies *have* the last word.
6. So sorry about the flu man; I feel your pain quite literally. Hope you recover soon.
7. That's really the beauty of it: asides from my initial comment following my question, none of us have made a single positive contribution here so far! I'm dancing around each of your arguments with oppositions, you are ignoring my oppositions and trying to find contradictions with my earlier comments while trying to sprinkle in an insult or two to intimidate/dismiss me. Like I already mentioned, this conversation has not yielded and will not yield anything fruitful. I enjoy the dance, so I'm still responding to you.",Chelsea,Yes,jep4psh,t1_jep2qvn
You seem really mistaken about what I'm trying to do here.,Chelsea,Yes,jep9s62,t1_jep4psh
"And what is that again? As a bonus, connect your comments here to this intention.",Chelsea,Yes,jepaven,t1_jep9s62
It's really better if I don't though.,Chelsea,Yes,jepccu5,t1_jepaven
Goodness me you are funny. Incredible. Oh well. Have a great day and I hope you feel better soon!,Chelsea,Yes,jepdo40,t1_jepccu5
"I know, I am, and I'm sure I will.",Chelsea,Yes,jepe3bg,t1_jepdo40
"For the future, it is generally in bad faith to go on accusing people of things without justifying the accusations, insulting them, and ignoring points that oppose your original argument,

But this was fun though. Cheers!",Chelsea,Yes,jepefza,t1_jepe3bg
I'm doing those things on purpose. You straight up said that your goal is to waste time. I'm just helping you out by wasting time. It's what you said you wanted this conversation to be.,Chelsea,Yes,jepembt,t1_jepefza
"Really? Really, you are helping me out by wasting time? Come on.

My goal has never been to waste time. My earlier stated goal is to have the last word. In fact I said I have all the time in the word to ensure I put in the last word, and you swore you wouldn't let me do so. I accepted your challenge, and so this conversation continues.",Chelsea,Yes,jepeyr9,t1_jepembt
Being determined to have the last word as the goal of a conversation is the same thing as wasting time. I'm helping you waste time.,Chelsea,Yes,jepfaok,t1_jepeyr9
"This is not true *a priori*.

I am finding optimal ways to use my time to ensure that I have the last word. We have established that the conversation is pointless and unfruitful, and in any case both of us are wasting time. Despite this, my goal is to minimise wasted time while having the last word in. This is what I will try to do despite your efforts to the contrary.",Chelsea,Yes,jepfsa3,t1_jepfaok
Sure thing boss.,Chelsea,Yes,jepg5vj,t1_jepfsa3
"And there it is; you've done it again.

This was fun though, but I hope your life never depends on you doing it successfully. Have a good day!",Chelsea,Yes,jepglws,t1_jepg5vj
"I certainly hope that my life never depends on trolling a bully and wasting their time successfully, but if it were I think I'm doing ok at it. You're still here after all",Chelsea,Yes,jeph4vb,t1_jepglws
"Let's dissect it again.

So far we have established that (1) we both have as much time in the entire world to waste, since we are beside our sick beds down with the flu (2) that you are not trolling, since your intention so far has been genuine (3) that I am not a bully, from the discussion just a few comments earlier (4) that you are doing a really poor job of pretty much anything you have attempted for the past two hours (5) that I will stay for as long as possible as long as I get in the final word.

These are all direct contradictions to everything in that comment. l am truly impressed by the efficiency with which you generate not just lies, but entire *anti-truths*.",Chelsea,Yes,jepi0wx,t1_jeph4vb
"It's also worth nothing how much of your entire discourse has been focused on labelling me as things that I am not. First a ""gatekeeper"", then a ""critic"", then a ""pretentious blowhard"", and then a ""bully"". You have stuck with the final one because psychologically speaking it is poorly defined.

These comments are those of a bad actor who doesn't acknowledge their own fallacies, and struggles to create arguments of their own. At this stage it's like a big brother running circles round a little brother; at some point I have to acknowledge that although I believe in you you're just not very good at this right now. I know you'll get better in time though, and one day you'll be cleaning out Reddit comments and be embarrassed by how you've handled everything today.",Chelsea,Yes,jepiyn3,t1_jeph4vb
"For the umpteenth time, I hope that if (or when) you will stand to lose something significant (unlike my baseline stranger respect, which is what you have lost today), you are much better at this.

Cheers and have a great day!",Chelsea,Yes,jepj68n,t1_jeph4vb
"It's interesting how often you want to evaluate how I'm doing when we've already established you don't actually know what it is. I'll give you a hint. Contradictions are part of it! I'm doing it on purpose! What's funny is you are going to either forget I said this, or try to make it mean something else.",Chelsea,Yes,jepkhsj,t1_jepi0wx
I'm being a bad actor on purpose. And its working. You're still here.,Chelsea,Yes,jepkkpn,t1_jepiyn3
"I want you to know this sincerely. I don't act this way hardly at all. You asked it of me (save the spiel about how you didn't, I don't mean literally).",Chelsea,Yes,jepkox3,t1_jepj68n
"Oh okay. I have been quite ignorant here. I tend to take people at their word, and it can be jarring to communicate online to people that aren‚Äôt in this category and don‚Äôt make clear that they aren‚Äôt.

Regardless, the fact that at some point all your contradictions became deliberate (üòÇüòÇüòÇ) implies that the comment before that was me having the final real word. Therefore, in any case my goal has been achieved a long time ago. Cheers, and have a great day!",Chelsea,Yes,jeplf6v,t1_jepkhsj
"I genuinely do not care.

My baseline level of respect (insignificant as it is) depends on my interaction with you, and not what you claim you are. So far, you have not acted like someone who merits even the respect I give a stranger, not to mention the respect of an admirable one. I really hope you take some lessons from all of today‚Äôs conversation, particularly the merits of not charging into logical traps you set, insulting other people you know nothing about, and taking the easy way out of those traps.",Chelsea,Yes,jepm659,t1_jepkox3
"I've been clear I'm trolling you. I even straight up said it and you were like ""nah, you aren't"".

Listen, if shifting the goal posts to whatever the ""final real word"" is helps you justify it, then by all means go ahead. I'm going to guess you'll be back though, in part because you've tried to leave and tell me to have a good day several times already, and yet you are still here. I also know that several things I've said here are going to bug you, and you're really going to want to respond to them.",Chelsea,Yes,jeplx2v,t1_jeplf6v
"See, I knew you would be back. You can't help yourself.",Chelsea,Yes,jepmieh,t1_jepm659

I like to construct my reality from basic facts, evidence, and inference. But you are impressively manipulative.

Your anti-truths are a lot like those of the President Trump of your country. This is something that I do not have experience with, and that I should learn to navigate in due time myself. I will let you have the last word whatever it is, and I will not respond further.

All it takes is one good game until people start praising him, as if he's not a fucking disaster most games.",Chelsea,Yes,jemfgqr,t1_jem54or
I think he's fine as a back up to Chilly but he should never ever be playing as a centre back. Why on earth Badashille didn't play yesterday is a fucking mystery. Instead Potter plays a 5'8 left back at centre half. Mind boggling.,Chelsea,Yes,jemimqx,t1_jem54or

"As with many of the players we've bought this season, it's not about overpaying for one player instead of getting another. It's purely, why did buy a player for that position at all? 


We needed another midfielder, a backup RB and a striker. We brought in a midfielder, but also sold one, so we didn't sold that problem. We bought a backup RB, but sent him out on loan, so we didn't solve that problem and we bought in more ""not really a striker, more like a second striker/CAM""s.

"They're really in a vice after this game. Emery took over after him, has a worse team than him, took over when there were something like 12 places between the two teams and now he's taken Villa ahead of us and they're praising what he's building there.

"He gets more positional freedom and consistency than any other attacker. He doesn't have to play wingback ever, doesn't have to be a false 9, doesn't have to move into the pivot, he's gotten to be an attacker with little responsibilities for most of the last two and a half seasons while our midfielders cover for his adventurism. If he can't thrive under those conditions he's not going to work out here anyway.",Chelsea,Yes,jeicdh8,t1_jeibquv
"Mounts problem is, he is more than willing to contribute to the team, if they asked him to play goalkeeper he would probably say yes, it sounds funny but its really fucking annoying, and causes the problems hes in now, lets hope potter gets him into the midfield or if hes going to play upfront that he fills in the as a backup, who knows maybe enzo has some effect on him in the position he plays",Chelsea,Yes,jeig67c,t1_jeibquv
"He should have been sacked long before the spurs game. 

Should have been sacked during the world cup break imo though I've wanted him out from day 1 as I didn't think he should have even been on our shortlist after Tuchel went 

Thought he did a poor job at Brighton and was completely carried by excellent recruitment,  I just don't see a decent manager there I've never got the Potter hype he' never finished a PL season with a positive goal difference and hasn't won a single cup game against premier league opposition in his career he's a shocking tactician",Chelsea,Yes,jelgsm8,t1_jelf5z6

I remember him looking good in the 13/14 preseason. I went to the Hull game at the start of the season and he looked quite good. Never took off for him though at Chelsea. Not sure why Mourinho wasn‚Äôt that keen.,Chelsea,Yes,jejqco0,t1_jejdy8o

">he's gotten to be an attacker with little responsibilities for most of the last two and a half seasons while our midfielders cover for his adventurism.

"Oh shit, my bad lul",Chelsea,Yes,jejr1ge,t1_jejgh2t
"Yes, havertz continues to say he can play any position but its clear he cant play as a striker, he played a lot better when he dropped back into the mid and saw the game ahead of him instead of being the final product, he wants to help so if potter says play wing he will play it

TT tried that with cho and potter tried it with raheem and pulisic, in those case it was horrible so it didnt matter if they said yes or no",Chelsea,Yes,jeiu05p,t1_jeisobv
Ironically I was the most emotionally disconnected under Tuchel. The whole time he was clearly just another short term manager that would leave. I‚Äôm of the belief that Potter is different.

"Won‚Äôt happen that way as Mount has one year left and no carrying value on the books, means 100% profit for FFP. 

Havertz is also the better player as the 10 in terms of link up play, goal threat and physicality. He is also better now.

What could also happen is both could be sold if we‚Äôre not looking to keep his ‚Äò9.5‚Äô profile where he‚Äôs not quite a 9 or 10, in favour of an actual winger or 10.",Chelsea,Yes,jej0iis,t1_jeizp0o
"I get your first point and if we get our value for him it will be great! But i dont see mount leaving, again i could be wrong.

Havertz is the better player currently and if we continue to play well and he finds form id prefer him to stay i just dont see him staying here long term, he said something the other day about his gf packing up and coming to live with him, and thats going to have an effect on his life too.

Possible, we might just straighten everything out and get a proper striker, nkunku comes in as the winger or possibly felix is the winger in this situation",Chelsea,Yes,jej3dum,t1_jej0iis

"Maybe I am a Debbie downer and a pessimist but I‚Äôm just going to type it out here so i can copy to anyone else who uses this awful excuse. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre shit because of mental fatigue there was a lot of games last year yeno1!!1!22!!!‚Äù

We cannot use this excuse. To justify that I am going to compare us and city over the last 5 years 

We have both been very consistent and have made tough long seasons the norm. The year we won the league however was probably cities worst season in this spell only winning a league cup but still getting 80 odd points in the league and getting second comfortably. 

In most other seasons city have basically won the double as they won the league cup along the league except for last year when they only won the league. I mean when we won the Champion League city won the treble and we were quite used to getting bounced out of the cups early doors. 

So city have been able to consistently challenge every year bar one where I‚Äôd argue they weren‚Äôt even that bad especially compared to us now and they won a trophy still. 

Whereas our drop offs are monumental. Two seasons ago was unlucky with injuries. It was our own doing by not buying a centre back but i suppose people were just too bought into what we had and thought we were invincible. 

Then we see us last season. Sure we played every single game and were close to immortality but city got to the semi final of the champions league and FA Cup too. The league cup doesn‚Äôt hold as much weight as we‚Äôve thrown it away before and it didn‚Äôt seem to hurt city congestion wise so we can‚Äôt really complain. Our squad was actually much bigger than cities too. We can talk about the fringe player quality but it was a full squad and Luis Diaz was a great asset to come in midway through the season. 

All in all city have basically faced the same adversity as us in the last 4/5 years but they don‚Äôt suddenly finish 8th with no challenge at all and just blame it on fatigue they finish 2nd and just come back next season.",Liverpool,No,jf13jv6,t3_12c90kd

What we are consistently doing is nothing. Confidence is so low in the team. They struggle to make even 5 yard passes. I struggle with the notion that Klopp and the team can just throw their arms up and basically say ‚Äòit‚Äôs all over, what is the point‚Äô.

"I just couldnt believe how bad Henderson was yesterday, all while slagging our other players off, the step in the right direction business - it just rubs me the wrong way. 

We played horrendously bad, and a large reason why is because our midfield was so horrendous, which is in large part due to Hendo‚Äôs and Favinho‚Äôs non-existent performance. It‚Äôs like he doesn‚Äôt have the self awareness to recognize this. 

A more explosive midfielder in his position will literally transform the way we play. But the captain is continuing to slag off players like Ali and younger players like Jones all while being the very root of our problems. I love Henderson, but he needs to be in Milner‚Äôs very limited role next season or else we‚Äôre going to continue seeing the same old problems.

New signings should make us look better, but a Sporting director could not come soon enough, also might be time to pull a page out Alex Ferguson's playbook and inject some new voices in the backroom staff.

The idea that he'd struggle without space is just untrue, look at how often Hendo was in that right channel with space last night, only to have no quality on the ball. Trent would thrive in those situations.

Covering runners however would be an issue, same as at full back, in the end it comes down to Trent and his attitude. It's not about quality, he was a much better defender years ago when he was up and coming.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1nq04,t1_jf1me8k

"I‚Äôd argue that it is still important to stay in Europe. European football is different to premier league and the competition is still reasonable.

However, you could experiment a bit more with lineups in the group stages as it is slightly less tough than UCL.

Anyway, I just think that we need to fix our preparation and rotational strength and we will need Europe to do that.

And if we strengthen properly, we will be 1000 times better already.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0pxrd,t1_jf0pfsr
"Every time I hear 'Klopp won't change his 4-3-3' I do a massive facepalm. He made big changes this match and it had no impact, it even made us more sterile because it turns out leaving 35 G+A Salah out like this sub likes to suggest every time he has an average game blunts our attack. We've tried different formations and this match he dropped Robbo and Trent, which is what some of the more braindead characters on this sub have been calling for all season - only for Tsimikas to demonstrate why Robbo starts big games and our right side to have zero incisiveness.

This is obviously a personnel issue and has been since the start of the season. Yet the tactical wunderkinds here will focus on criticizing the manager for playing Nunez wide (while Diaz is still out), as though that would solve anything without a midfield to get the ball to him.

My favourite part is people having a go at Klopp for starting Fabinho and Henderson over....whom exactly? Arthur Melo, a decrepit corpse of a player who hasn't played professional football in a year? Carvalho, who I rate but obviously isn't a fit for CM? I've even heard clowns calling for Doak to get a start against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge - shades of Ben Woodward here. These people aren't to be taken seriously.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0tp1j,t1_jf0pfsr
"Yeah, it's an entirely lazy complaint. There is honestly nothing he can do to fix that midfield. It's a personnel issue, they're going to be ran over regardless of how they are set up. People asking us to play deeper, we've sat deep at times and it doesn't help. If your midfielders are traffic cones, they're not going to win challenges if they sit 10 yards deeper. They'll still be traffic cones but instead your attacking play becomes even more hopeless.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0pr2p,t1_jf0pfsr
"People are exposing their lack of tactical knowledge when they keep talking about formations. As if a team just plays in a fixed formation full game and doesn't consist of moving parts. 

For me the team shape is way more important than a formation. Ever since Thiago and Bajcetic got injured.  We were always going to struggle.

Henderson and Fabinho were benched earlier for a reason. They clearly aren't good enough, nor do we have any other options available.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0px7g,t1_jf0pfsr
"I immediately ignore the comment when someone says to change things up, stop doing the same thing.

We've played like 5 different formations this season and have gone from a super high line 70% possession team to being in a lower block, low possession team where our creativity is lumping balls to the wing because our midfield can't interplay anymore. And hoping our front 3 can win the ball and counter themselves.

The past 2 months Klopp is flat out bypassing the midfield now, he knows they are shit he doesn't need to say it publicly for everyone. It's evident in how we are tactically what the manager thinks of his current options.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0rnca,t1_jf0pfsr
"I think the only one you could potentially argue is if Thiago was fit to go into a midfield 2, but then as you said that doesn‚Äôt fix players inability to make a 5 yard pass or put a shift in. They‚Äôre done

Also Klopp has changed it a few times this season and we‚Äôve seen the same result they‚Äôre shite anyway",Liverpool,Yes,jf0r841,t1_jf0pfsr
He‚Äôs made minor changes but has not ready changed the overall style of play.  We can‚Äôt press effectively and still play a high line- this will never work with the players he has.

"He‚Äôs working with them off the pitch every day, training (apparently) the SamE personnel that everybody cries ‚Äòalmost won the quad‚Äô.

Last night was on Klopp. Yes he changed it up, by not starting our most creative players and starting the pillars of Atlantia in Fabinho and Henderson. He then waited too long to change anything and when he did they were the wrong changes.

Yes we‚Äôre watching the same thing, and changing the system might get something out of them, can‚Äôt be any worse than doing the same thing and expecting the same results.

I cannot agree with any of the other responses they‚Äôre insane. Basically ‚Äòsound were shite well just keep doing this until the summer and hope to buy better form‚Äô",Liverpool,Yes,jf0wkmj,t1_jf0pfsr
Tbh Chelsea could have had 5 last night if it wasn't for poor finishing and close VAR calls. Same for one of the cup finals last year as well.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1s30b,t1_jf1gc5y
Match fixing?,Liverpool,Yes,jf1oppu,t1_jf1gc5y
I laughed so hard,Liverpool,Yes,jf2xuzf,t1_jf2xjrk
Worst thing is they couldn‚Äôt have done it for our game?,Liverpool,Yes,jf32nn6,t1_jf2xjrk
"10 point gap with only 10 games. And still 4 away games to play which are all guaranteed to drop points. No chance I'm afraid. 

Even 5th would be a push depending on how Spurs finish the season. Our form is so bad that I think we might miss out on europe altogether.",Liverpool,Yes,jf3ofhd,t1_jf3kyju
"Sell him, its a no brainer. He has a tiny glimpse of value right now, whilst the overall shitness of the team masks any one individuals true value.

Everyone saying hes a HG and low earning player - we could just as easily replace him with some HG 18 or 19 year old who'd offer just as much but actually has potential. Keeping him now is exactly how we end up with deadwood down the line, its like nobody learns their lesson lol.

If we improve our midfield markedly, he could be replaced with a much younger player with a higher ceiling, and if we don't, we're in the exact same position as now - wondering why we're playing him when we had the opportunity to get rid seasons ago",Liverpool,Yes,jf0xvr2,t1_jf0wrgx
"Kept. Nobody else is willing to play so little and put an effort in, is home grown and on a lower salary. Those carabao cup games against Swindon etc you still need players. He‚Äôs not great by any stretch of the imagination but at this rate I‚Äôd rid of Fabinho and hendo before him",Liverpool,Yes,jf0xf4j,t1_jf0wrgx
"People will say sold but based on this season, half the squad should be going with him. He's been unlucky with injuries but hasn't played any better or worse than the experienced pros in our team.

A home-grown player who is happy to have a squad role AND just happens to be local and loves the club isn't something we should lightly throw aside.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0wz3i,t1_jf0wrgx
"Tough to say. He might need to go out and play a lot more to improve. 
But he is too good for a championship loan, but not good enough for a Premier league loan.
So I think it‚Äôs sell it keep, unless he wants to go to Germany. 

It isn‚Äôt crazy that young players development stagnate and pick up again later. So I wouldn‚Äôt be against keeping him either. 

Depends on the price really. If we get offers north of 20 we should listen. 25 it‚Äôs definite.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0zafv,t1_jf0wrgx
"I think he should be kept at least for another season or two, we're already limited in midfield numbers and there's nobody better that we can buy that would be willing to be 5th/6th choice. If he's still not improved by then he would still only be 24 and can get a decent fee selling to a lower prem or championship side.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1ht03,t1_jf0wrgx
Hectic Blatter vibes,Liverpool,Yes,jf1xa0o,t1_jf1ogi5
"Fitness levels he‚Äôs 31 turning 32 this year he‚Äôs not able to press for 90mins like he did 3 years ago for us. But Nunez should have stayed on, we needed physical forwards for that Chelsea defence and Gakpo/Nunez/Salah would have been perfect",Liverpool,Yes,jf2atcd,t1_jf29cyt
"And yes, we‚Äôve still been generally poor away, but those 4 are Leeds (13th), West Ham (15th), Leicester (19th) and Southampton (20th) so that‚Äôs something.",Liverpool,Yes,jf38ya3,t1_jf374mi
"When that post was up about Newcastle wanting to give 60m for him I couldn't believe so many people were against that.

60m for an injury prone, hideously out of form striker.

I love the bloke and think he has been brilliant in the past but for that money you can't turn it down.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1cmia,t1_jf1c92k
">How long do we have to persist with playing Jota?

he been fine.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1d4ri,t1_jf1c92k
"He has been really poor and it's frustrating because he is soo good.

I just think he needs to get through this last couple of month and forget this season ever happened. 

I feel bad for him because he missed all of pre season and beginning of the season injured. Came back started a couple of games and then got another lengthy injury making him miss his first world cup. And then has came back being played in different positions every game in different front 3's. Tbh it isn't a surprise he hasn't been good really.

I think he just needs to be a bench option for the rest of this season and hopefully he's back to his best next season.

Do think it's harsh how bad he's been slated as well. People quickly forgotten how good he is and how pivotal he was for us last season.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1tly7,t1_jf1c92k
i agree. he still improving with each game. yesterday he looked good,Liverpool,Yes,jf1ctq9,t1_jf1c6hl
Weird how journos didn't say anything regarding Klopp's future all season but now they all come out of the woodwork at once. Feels like some kind of concentrated effort.,Liverpool,Yes,jf46fw4,t1_jf425rk
If he doesn't get serious money to spend and we start next season in the same form then he'll leave. He isn't stupid.,Liverpool,Yes,jf4c8jp,t1_jf425rk
It's just fodder for rivals to pounce on and get excited about. Anyone with half a brain can say that it's such dross.,Liverpool,Yes,jf5g3k6,t1_jf425rk
Anyway we're gonna bullshit our way to a win vs Arsenal because it's Anfield like with city and Arsenal are due their United style thrashing,Liverpool,Yes,jf16k76,t1_jf15esb
Same. It would be a one off and theyd get knocked out pretty early,Liverpool,Yes,jf1lsmi,t1_jf1ixg2
Are they not pressing because they aren't that kind of player or are they not pressing because Klopp's turned down the intensity? It feels to me like that's a tactical decision to cover for our rubish midfield more than them not being willing to press.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1i9a3,t1_jf1gism
"Check out the blue moon forum, see what they say about  Hillsborough. Gloating about damaging the bus, calling Liverpool fans bin dippers. They are a disgusting bunch there. They have a hate thread with 2k pages just for Liverpool.

I can't imagine wanting them to win.",Liverpool,Yes,jf29w9a,t1_jf1ywzj
City would‚Äôve beaten us even if Rodri got a red card. They could‚Äôve scored 6 or 7 but they decided to toy with us instead,Liverpool,Yes,jf21yev,t1_jf1ywzj
The conference league has the best theme out of the 3 of them to be fair,Liverpool,Yes,jf39gh9,t1_jf380p7
"Screw europa league, we need a complete clean slate to focus on getting in the UCL and weeding out all the finished/mediocre players.",Liverpool,Yes,jf38umq,t1_jf380p7
Karius too,Liverpool,Yes,jf4w553,t1_jf46pdl
Jones can't do much with the ball if he doesn't have 5 minutes to think about it. He's not improved on that one bit through the years.,Liverpool,Yes,jf0pywt,t1_jf0lomk
"He did also set up the best chance last night though.

No idea why Jota didn't just hit it first time.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0tu8c,t1_jf0lomk
"Jones had an absolute shocker. No vision, no anticipation. He just felt out of sorts. Even that one when Nunez fought to get the ball in the box and Jones came (too late) to help him out and when Nunez actually won it, Jones had overran it.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0nn7l,t1_jf0lomk
Wasn‚Äôt he being racially abused too?,Liverpool,Yes,jf2dkrh,t1_jf1xiyi
"A 25% stake is pretty huge, suggests to me that they‚Äôd be interested in acquiring a majority in the future.",Liverpool,Yes,jf2uh1g,t1_jf2tya6
Damn they're worth more than the owners of Newcastle,Liverpool,Yes,jf2zvs9,t1_jf2tya6
Didn‚Äôt we supposedly cancel our America tour in the summer with an eye instead towards Singapore?,Liverpool,Yes,jf31ml5,t1_jf2tya6
"Singapore human rights report isn't looking good: https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/asia-and-the-pacific/south-east-asia-and-the-pacific/singapore/report-singapore/ 

I hope these aren't connected to the government and are a private firm because I can totally see people bringing up racism and Islamphobia for turning a blind eye on Singapore but refusing Qatar.",Liverpool,Yes,jf3332e,t1_jf2tya6
"This reeks of short term memory. I've been plenty critical of Klopp this season, it shouldn't be news he's too loyal or tactically inflexible. 

These are issues that have surfaced consistently throughout his career, but are more often offset by the incredible highs he takes his team to. I will continue to be critical of him as he makes mistakes this year but, I stand by the fact I'd take him over anybody else in that squad. 

I have lived through three decades of supporting this team and he's by far the best manager in that time. You think it's ""stupid"" for people to realise how hard and rare it can be to find a manager who fits and works with the club and the fans like he does? One bad year (he wasn't at fault for being left short and performed another miracle to get us too 4 two years ago) and you're very ready to create scenarios that should see him gone?

Like you do realise you're just making it up that it could go poorly next year? It might, but it's more likely he will do good work as he has mostly done. in fact I can also predict the future since you seem to enjoy that role play.

If fans like you start with this nonsense and we end up losing him earlier than we should, I hope you remember comments like this in the decades of manager turmoil we would more than likely go through again without him. You think seasons like this are bad because of him? I can't wait to see what you think of what life was like as a Liverpool fan before he came.",Liverpool,Yes,jf16u4j,t1_jf14vn4
"You're being perfectly reasonable but apparently Klopp is untouchable even if he loses 38 games in a row with 0 tactical ideas so ü§∑

He's been great for the club. Past tense doesn't make you a God",Liverpool,Yes,jf23mvj,t1_jf14vn4
"My favourite is the ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather be relegated than lose Klopp‚Äù comments, absolutely insane.",Liverpool,Yes,jf16bsh,t1_jf14vn4
I think he still needs a run of games. It is harsh to judge a player after 1 game.,Liverpool,Yes,jf0ym1i,t1_jf0y3se
"This is why I‚Äôve been defending the lad, o 100% never worded it as well as you mind. Everybody knows Jones isn‚Äôt particularly good but the lads grafting and hardly the worst midfielder currently getting a game. Unless a bid comes in I‚Äôd happily keep him for games like carabao cup, Swindon away etc. it‚Äôs senior players like Henderson and Fabinho that should be helping the younger lads in these tough times",Liverpool,Yes,jf12jm8,t1_jf0y3se
"Yeah I always have a theory that when a ship is going down the people who were already dragging it down will try to downplay the crisis. 

Henderson and Curtis were already some of the weakest players in the squad so there level hasn‚Äôt even really dropped much in my opinion so they will naturally downplay the situation. Whereas someone like Robertson is much more of a realist because he can feel the drop off of the team.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1hasg,t1_jf1e79q
Jones wouldnt even start for liverpool ladies,Liverpool,Yes,jf1j76w,t1_jf1e79q
"This summer, no more next summers",Liverpool,Yes,jf1k3k6,t1_jf1eh1m
This summer. Please. Can‚Äôt have another season like this.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1i4e3,t1_jf1eh1m
I don't see it as harsh with Jones. I'd probably play him some more till the end of the season just to see what he has got. They need to make a decision on him to either try and sell him or keep him.,Liverpool,Yes,jf0vssv,t1_jf0vfwi
What did they do?,Liverpool,Yes,jf2jldq,t1_jf273ld
"It's where we are. I think there are moments when we show that we still have things in our locker.  But without a solid midfield , we always concede chances and the confidence has seeped away. We need a midfield reboot and we'd be better. Just accept what it is right now because no one can fix this. No personnel changes. We need a window",Liverpool,Yes,jf0w4um,t1_jf0usoq
I want to see TAA as a RM and Gomez as a RB. To give him the free role and we play a 451 counter Vs Arsenal.,Liverpool,Yes,jf0zagt,t1_jf0yqlz
I miss Thiago...,Liverpool,Yes,jf14ejm,t1_jf145sj
I'll be interested to see what we come out of the pre-season with. Beyond us having Salah on the right I honestly couldn't tell you what Klopp's gonna come up with.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1bfu6,t1_jf145sj
Nunez has always been a left sided attacker though? He‚Äôs not a natural centre forward. He‚Äôs a LST/LW,Liverpool,Yes,jf14smm,t1_jf145sj
"Something we haven't had to do in my lifetime (32) is replace a ln amazing keeper - so the answer is one of the more up in the air ones. 

Hopefully one of our traditionally tricky positions doesn't go back to that",Liverpool,Yes,jf33ae3,t1_jf2jsuh
Thanks for unlocking a great memory,Liverpool,Yes,jf39abx,t1_jf390ae
"I never once believed we'd win City, although I never believed the defeat would be in the manner it was, but I was convinced we'd beat Chelsea and Arsenal. Now we face the very real prospect of finishing the week with no points won, when in my opinion we needed six from nine to stay in the hunt for 4th. Frankly the only reason Chelsea didn't win last night is because they're so shit. Arsenal are not. I don't think I've had less faith in a Liverpool team since just before Klopp arrived.",Liverpool,Yes,jf21xh7,t1_jf1zjfj
I really don‚Äôt think anyone is genuinely confident after our past few matches.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1zq7o,t1_jf1zjfj
We‚Äôre getting drilled.,Liverpool,Yes,jf26yvb,t1_jf1zjfj
[deleted],Liverpool,Yes,jf213bx,t1_jf1zjfj
"I don't think players will show up expecting to win because I don't think that's how professional athletes think tbh haha.

But I do think it's strange why fans seem so confident. I wouldn't be surprised if they put 4 or 5 past us.",Liverpool,Yes,jf2atwz,t1_jf1zjfj
Can see us shit housing a draw and cost Arsenal the title because they will lose away to city,Liverpool,Yes,jf29vu9,t1_jf1zjfj
Don‚Äôt worry fella we rested Trent robbo and salah for it,Liverpool,Yes,jf2dha1,t1_jf1zjfj
Tbh United are shit,Liverpool,Yes,jf0ms2r,t1_jf0masz
The two games that we‚Äôve played the best in this year have been Everton and United. At least the team knows that they need to put in a shift against our two biggest historical rivals.,Liverpool,Yes,jf0ns8x,t1_jf0masz
I wish our players actually pressed as intensely as those kids.,Liverpool,Yes,jf193nz,t1_jf16g81
The problem is he is playing way too many safe passes nowadays. How do we untrain the safe pass.,Liverpool,Yes,jf2dqbz,t1_jf26l62
I think he only plays there until diaz comes back. Then he will be moved upfront.,Liverpool,Yes,jf10bg6,t1_jf0zdj4
"I hope not because as soon as a team pushes him toward the touchline it stifles him.

And Diaz is a better winger than him by some margin.",Liverpool,Yes,jf102u4,t1_jf0zdj4
"I hope not. He‚Äôs not a winger, he‚Äôs a striker. Idk why Klopp has an obsession of playing strikers as wingers, he did the same with Origi. I‚Äôm hoping when Diaz is back and we have an actual midfield next season, Nunez will be back at striker",Liverpool,Yes,jf0zoj0,t1_jf0zdj4
"Take 60m from Newcastle and bring someone else, easily",Liverpool,Yes,jf0ydfh,t1_jf0qz38
"Part of the issue with him is his best period for us was when he was our number 9 for a time. Gakpo, Nunez and Salah are all preferred over him as the 9 at this point, he's not really got the dynamism to drag this team up the pitch from the wing so he is just completely ineffectual in matches now.

If we were dominating possession and territory then he would be more impactful on the wing as he will still be in and around the box. No chance right now, we need Diaz desperately.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0rv8n,t1_jf0qz38
"Truth be told he‚Äôs always struggled with maintaining possession and link up play, it was just way less noticeable when he was scoring for fun. I really do think he‚Äôs the type of player we need to cash in on while we can and sign a younger, faster option with more potential as our 5th rotation spot.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0ze5p,t1_jf0qz38
"I'd love to be a fly on the wall behind the scenes at the moment. Just to see how different the tone in press conferences is to what's being said behind closed doors.

It's weird because Klopp has been vocally critical of poor displays when things were good, but he's obviously mostly avoided doing so this season. 

My theory is he's just reading the room on motivation. Players are already down and he's likely gave them a kicking too, and reading about him in the media saying it again probably won't help.",Liverpool,Yes,jf19pa3,t1_jf19cz7
Did you listen to the rest of the interview that gave reasonable context to this statement?,Liverpool,Yes,jf1cwl7,t1_jf19cz7
"Meh don't bother man. I am sure the same lot will call Klopp the best manager in Europe when he turns things around in 6 months. Modern football fans are just Fickle bunch.

Twitter has ruined football. Now everyone looks like some idiot like Sean o Doyle or Laurie lfc and their constant complaining and think this is what a modern day football fan Is.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1cotj,t1_jf1atyi

High pressing football without a backup for years now. What do you think might've happened?,Liverpool,Yes,jf1b6gj,t1_jf19eol
Injuries/fatigue. We never bought a guy to share the load with him.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1bkic,t1_jf19eol
"Fabinho had one good season for us and I‚Äôll die on that hill. He‚Äôs genuinely been dreadful for three years now, but people only just realized.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1ay02,t1_jf19eol
"If Chelsea had an actual finisher up front or if we didn't have Alisson, that game ends 3-0 to Chelsea

If we play the same, Arsenal are going to win",Liverpool,Yes,jf1g4mq,t1_jf1cum4
"Thank fuck someone else can see it haha.

Nunez out wide when we aren't getting space and he has players close marking him is just a total wasted player, we may as well have me or you playing there. for someone so chaotic and exciting why are we chosing to restrict him so much?

The only time he looks good on the wing is if we are countering and he has space to run into or is if he can manage to get into a central position like he actually has to do for pretty much every goal he has scored for us.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1soss,t1_jf1cum4

There is also a [Megabus](https://uk.megabus.com/), which will get you to Liverpool earlier and back to London earlier, but the journey is longer

"It's defo not a big deal like a lot have made on here I agree.

One thing that does annoy me though is when a player is the first to moan at everyone around him when playing like shite every single game, and that's the stage Hendo has got to. He moans at everyone else for literally everything, he often misplaces passes and blames others.

Hendo being vocal, shouting, organising has been a good thing over the years and is a huge part and a positive part of his game. But it will obviously lose credibility when he's poor every game.",Liverpool,Yes,jf27hg1,t1_jf2233j
"It‚Äôs a match thread, people are just venting.

He has been working best when him and gakpo are interchanging freely like they were figuring out nicely before his injury and he was coming in mainly from the left. When diaz is back, they will probably chop and change positions",Liverpool,Yes,jf1hzpl,t1_jf1gk6v
"People just want an easy explanation for why we aren't doing well so 'wHy iS nuNeZ wIdE' is the latest one, even though he's played as well for us there as anywhere else, and played there for Benfica quite a bit. It's clear it's just until Diaz is back but that won't stop muppets from giving out about it.",Liverpool,Yes,jf2nnnh,t1_jf1gk6v
"Nunez was signed to be a central striker to finish all the chances we usually wasted in the middle.

Gakpo was signed as a left winger.

For the love of christ i cannot see why they are being played in opposite positions which they are weaker in.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1ztdf,t1_jf1gk6v
It's getting embarrassing watching Henderson and Fabinho every week. It baffles me how slow and sluggish they both are. I've seen a lot of Chelsea recently and Kovacic and Enzo have been relatively poor the majority of time. Yet last night they took the piss out of our midfield the way they kept beating them and getting behind them was unreal. And Kante's first start in 7 months yet looked like the fittest bloke on the planet compared to them 2.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1wkhh,t1_jf1u5bk
"Some of Henderson‚Äôs first touches in the closing 20 minutes were actually painful to watch any attack he is involved in is shut down instantly.  

If only he was as good as nullifying attacks at the other end",Liverpool,Yes,jf1wfe0,t1_jf1u5bk
"He wasn‚Äôt slagging Alisson, they were having  a go over Matip and communication. I get he‚Äôs not had a good season and has been exposed but your reason for it is just not based within reality.",Liverpool,Yes,jf252o5,t1_jf1u5bk
"Good player, but don't we already have enough injury prone members in the squad?",Liverpool,Yes,jf2k47e,t1_jf26wtj
Without Salah and TAA we lack any creation at all. It would make sense.,Liverpool,Yes,jf2dlyw,t1_jf26wtj

"I really think this stems from the end of 20/21 season rather than last summer. That‚Äôs especially compounded by the fact that Klopp said just the other day that this season is happening due to mistakes in the past.

IMO he wanted to keep Gini and failing that replace him with world class talent such as Tchouamenhi etc. Failing both of those options he thought the players in his squad would be adequate to bridge the gap until FSG gave him something to spend. I think Edwards/Ward thought that pretty much anyone would be able to fill in Gini‚Äôs minutes without much downside but they completely overlooked how much more of a physical demand covering his games would put on players like Thiago and Keita who already struggle to stay fit anyway. Our midfield players were at their limit, now they‚Äôve red lined.

So I can‚Äôt put it on Klopp as he‚Äôs provided 2 options for managing the squad that were realistic. A star new midfield investment with a big price tag or keep a first team staple, extremely affordable option (or we‚Äôve spent more on melo for example). After both of these were rejected I‚Äôm guessing he just gave up and left them to deal with it which is bad but also I don‚Äôt think we should be asking Klopp to run with his 3rd choice scenarios and expect him to fake being passionate about it.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1cd21,t1_jf17h6q
Ward wasted 8 mill on Arthur Melo though.,Liverpool,Yes,jf17p8q,t1_jf17h6q
"I thought he was okay to be honest, especially in possession.... Out of possession though, don't think he did enough or was aware of danger enough.",Liverpool,Yes,jf5jxnk,t1_jf51boe
"Didn't we see the same issues just two years back and when fit cbs came back things went back somewhat to their usual self.

The same talking points were being repeated back then as well of how teams have figured us out but we still managed to get 92 points the next season. 

The only difference is this time isn't about waiting for the players to get fit it's about buying new players.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0q6ej,t1_jf0ntrb
"I do think there needs to be some coaching mix ups as well as new squad members. I trust Klopp to do the rebuild and he deserves a chance. Even if it‚Äôs not clicking now, we can‚Äôt change it until the summer in a major way anyway. I also fully back the idea that if he hasn‚Äôt managed to turn it around with backing in the summer and the team shows signs of who we were, then maybe it‚Äôs time for him to go. End of 2023 I think is fair. But I also trust he will fix it and this is just a blip.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0o2w7,t1_jf0ntrb

"That's really blunt. 

For me Henderson's place is also up for grabs. He brought very little besides shouting the last few months.

You have also overlooked players I'd personally keep, such as Bajetic, Thiago, Elliott, Carvalho, Tsimikas... 

People are always focussing on who to keep. They name a few they want to keep, as if we have the funds to buy 10 new players.  I'd rather just keep most players and lose some ballast (Ox, Naby, Phillips) or players who need minutes going to make it (Kelleher, Jones). And i'd add a few quality additions and keep most of the squad. 5 additions this summer already seems really ambitious knowing our owners.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1isnc,t1_jf1hvi1
Henderson cant run anymore and that was his M.O. he offers less than nothing now except shouting,Liverpool,Yes,jf1iw5n,t1_jf1hvi1

"Whoever clipped up the Henderson Alisson clip deliberately left out the seconds before; when Henderson was having a go at Matip. He is the captain and he has every right to say whatever he wants to both of them. Just because alisson is our best player, doesn‚Äôt mean he can‚Äôt be dressed down if needed. They also were hugging and laughing at the end. It‚Äôs part of the game.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0y7wr,t1_jf0xbpn
It's literally the captians job to call people out and sort the team out on the field.,Liverpool,Yes,jf0zyim,t1_jf0xbpn
">don‚Äôt get why TAA technical drop off isn‚Äôt talked about.

It's literally all anybody talks about and it's fucking insufferable. Trent gets slandered because he can't defend (despite constantly being left in 2/3 vs 1 situations because midfielders don't track back). He's rarely the only person at fault for a lot of goals on his side. 

Then he gets slandered for not being offensive enough when he has to sit deeper since Elliott/Hendo is incapable of covering the wing for him.

If you genuinely think Gomez is better than Trent offensively you need to see a doctor. Trents pass to Jota for Salah's goal against City at the weekend was magic. 

Fucking tired of our fans scape goating Trent",Liverpool,Yes,jf1tqu0,t1_jf1nuip
"Confidence. People tend to forget how big a factor that is in professional football. Look at Arsenal players, a team full of confident individuals who are arguably performing outwith their abilities.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1pyan,t1_jf1nuip

"I'm in full support of Klopp but let's not act like he can't be criticised. He's not faultless and he's definitely made mistakes. 

But he's done enough in the past to be given the time. He's said it himself.",Liverpool,Yes,jf135rf,t1_jf12wb0
No one wants him to leave but he deserves criticism too. His decision making has been poor this season,Liverpool,Yes,jf13818,t1_jf12wb0
"I know it's nitpicking, but we didn't win the Europa League under Klopp in 15/16, so it's one of each except the Europa League. At this rate, we'll have another shot at winning it next season, though.",Liverpool,Yes,jf13w1t,t1_jf12wb0

"Why don‚Äôt you imagine your dick rotting away from gangrene while you‚Äôre at it. Never understood these sorts of self flagellating masochistic fantasies. 

Klopp has reiterated time and again that he wants to stay and fight and go through the rebuild. All the reports are that he will be given significant backing over the summer. Joyce has very strongly insinuated that the Bellingham deal is close with others to come. At least wait until the summer before crying about the sky falling.",Liverpool,Yes,jf2yvmf,t1_jf2t47t

The only concern I have is Trent vs Martinelli, not too fussed about Saka because he normally doesn‚Äôt turn up against us. Jesus was also a pain when he was at City so he could be dangerous too. If we win, great, if we lose I‚Äôm not too bothered. I think most liverpool fans just want the season to end tbh so we can have a big summer",Liverpool,Yes,jf3lksn,t1_jf3k6l9
"Despite Arsenal's season, it would be unprecedented to go to Anfield and get a win, they haven't done it since September 2012. It's probably their best chance to get all three points, but I still back my team, despite everything, to bag the three points at home.",Liverpool,Yes,jf3lsum,t1_jf3k6l9
this isnt even that bad of a post and is getting downvoted way too much,Liverpool,Yes,jf5ixbr,t1_jf3k6l9
I think the atmosphere is going to be very intense because not only is it anfield but because of what happened in the fixture at the emirates. It is also our first home game in over a month.

"For the last time Maddison is a 10, we already have 3 or 4 players who play as 10's and they either get no game time (Jones, Carvalho) or play different positions (Elliott, Gakpo).

I don't necessarily think that one cancels out the other. Maddison would certainly be a welcomed addition.,Liverpool,Yes,jf2iol7,t1_jf2i2vz
Maddison would be really bad for us.,Liverpool,Yes,jf2jikm,t1_jf2i2vz
I think they are choosing mount over Maddison for a similar amount. But if we don't get him. I would love a Maddison here.,Liverpool,Yes,jf2j667,t1_jf2i2vz

"I mean we're also linked with Mount and a few others, and Mount was listed at about ¬£50m too. 

Just because a new player isn't being mentioned doesn't were not being linked with other midfielders, look at the the thread one of the mods made a few weeks back! Lots of midfielders better suited to our team.

"The plan was surely to play with either a 10 or with attacking 8's who would provide support in the middle while Darwin runs in behind. 

It wouldn't make much sense to sign Gakpo and Carvalho and give new contracts to Jones and Elliott if we didn't plan on playing with a 10. Darwin just isn't technically good enough to play as a lone 9 in our setup.

I reckon we also might see more of the 4-2-4 / 4-4-2 once Diaz is back. We looked pretty good with Diaz - Darwin - Firmino/Jota - Salah front line and we saw something similar in previous season with Mane - Jota - Firmino - Salah all playing together.",Liverpool,Yes,jf3uofh,t1_jf3kr7q
"I really don't think it's a bandaid tbh, I think it's always been the plan. There wouldn't be ""he's the missing piece"" quotes coming out if he was just a standard forward, he was bought to be Bobby's replacement and play false 9.",Liverpool,Yes,jf3r2lv,t1_jf3kr7q
"Nunez really shouldn't be playing on the wing, i agree. We bought him as a striker ffs! I still cant wrap my head around the fact were playing a left winger as the middle man of the front three and our striker on the wing... baffling.",Liverpool,Yes,jf3gsuo,t1_jf3fs01

Thiago's perennialy in the physio room. That's your creative players. Won't even get into the bench options.

""Buying better form"" is our best shot. I don't see the ability in these players that you seem to, honestly. I think half the squad is irreparably washed. A big rebuild is needed.

31 is really not that old,Liverpool,Yes,jf360ro,t1_jf2atcd
That‚Äôs probably the worst teams it could have been relegation teams are our problem,Liverpool,Yes,jf3dwun,t1_jf38ya3
"I couldn‚Äôt make a case for keeping him if we can get that much selling him. It doesn‚Äôt matter that he was out for four month, not scoring in a year is horrendous. He‚Äôs been poor outside of not scoring too. I loved him when he joined, he felt like a revelation, but Diaz, Gakpo, Nunez and Salah are all ahead of him.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1d1y7,t1_jf1cmia
The sub is full of morons. They'll cry about the idea of selling him but then two years down the line when he's injured all the time and still hasn't scored they'll cry about not selling him earlier.,Liverpool,Yes,jf27gu4,t1_jf1cmia
"Lad he hasn‚Äôt scored in a year, we‚Äôre not in the position to keep starting him hoping he improves each game.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1d5yt,t1_jf1ctq9
"He's not talking about the Rodri foul in the last City game, he's talking about Rodri's clear handball from last season for which he wasn't even carded.",Liverpool,Yes,jf2363r,t1_jf21yev
"Nah, even the colour scheme makes me want to throw up",Liverpool,Yes,jf3a2tl,t1_jf39gh9
"Agreed

Don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll make Top 6, but I am deathly afraid of finishing in 7th

Fixtures in the most obscure locations and the Thursday - Sunday combination would kill us",Liverpool,Yes,jf390js,t1_jf38umq
"> No vision, no anticipation. He just felt out of sorts. 

This is normal Curtis Jones. Bottom 1% IQ footballer. Little awareness of what's around him. Takes 10 touches more than he should. Seems immature.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0p4ej,t1_jf0nn7l
His positioning is abysmal. Doesn‚Äôt help the team both offensively and defensively.,Liverpool,Yes,jf0nsp0,t1_jf0nn7l
It‚Äôs most likely the way FSG want out,Liverpool,Yes,jf2wwo8,t1_jf2uh1g
Not too different from the USAs page. I don‚Äôt want to have to pick between the lesser of two evils but Singapore and Qatar are vastly different,Liverpool,Yes,jf33zr0,t1_jf3332e
"How am I just making it up? Have you watched how poor we have been this year? We have been very bad and there is definitely a reason to think things may not improve, but like I said I'm hopeful he can turn it around.

Maybe 'fans like you' should start thinking critically and watching our games before replying with the typical ""I'm a better fan than you!"" because someone thinks that preferring to get rid of all our world class players or even get relegated rather than losing Klopp is a bit unrealistic and stupid. 

I don't want Klopp to go, but acting like he is free from any blame this season is moronic.",Liverpool,Yes,jf17kfs,t1_jf16u4j
"Let's hope so eh? Because if we spend 200mil and get a load of new players in, and still play like shit, we're in serious trouble.",Liverpool,Yes,jf184fk,t1_jf16u4j
"He needs to start weekly, right now until the end of the seasons, I don‚Äôt rated him and want to get rid of him, but at least he is still 23 and can be utilized, as a squad player and HG like Joe Gomez ( as rb option)

Or we can sell him next season with some decent prices back if he has a good proper run for last 2 months.

There is no point to start fucking Henderson and Fabinho again.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0zkx5,t1_jf0ym1i
We‚Äôre judging him off his performances for the past 3 years where he hasn‚Äôt shown any signs of improvement. He‚Äôs a championship level player at the moment,Liverpool,Yes,jf0zgy6,t1_jf0ym1i
"If this is the ‚ÄúMilner glimpes‚Äù of Henderson and Fabinho at last night, we should bin them off next summer. They can‚Äôt even do their job themself, let alone helping younger players",Liverpool,Yes,jf1i5ad,t1_jf12jm8
"Thing is, because some people went absolutely *overboard* with criticism, saying he was the worst midfielder in the league and is Championship level *at best*, now having any level-headed analysis on what has ultimately been years of poor performances punctuated by injury/illness absence, you get lumped in with the former group

The truth of the matter is, he's our 9th choice midfielder. Its not his fault all but our 4th and 5th choice midfielders right now are even more injury prone than him, but that's just how its shaken out. *But* he's 22 now, so whilst he still has room for improvement, he has over half a century of league appearances and over 85 total senior appearances, yet hasn't really improved on his flaws that were present when he was 18.

We're not really the club for someone *so* raw to develop at, we have too many pressures for success. So it makes sense to sell him",Liverpool,Yes,jf0xki7,t1_jf0vssv
"Oh I do, I love watching him play haha.

I just found it so painful watching Nunez on the wing last night, he's probably are most exciting/dangerous player yet he is often so isolated out wide and offers nothing at times. So frustrating to watch.",Liverpool,Yes,jf16273,t1_jf14ejm
"Can't predict anything Klopp is doing atm tbh haha. 

I think Nunez was signed to be our striker, simply because of how good Diaz is and obvs Salah on the right. I think ¬£80m odd for a rotation option winger wouldn't of been sanctioned. 

IIRC The only game we played with Diaz-Nunez-Salah was Everton away but was a weird game to even base it off because Carvalho and Elliot played as our 2 CM's. Which was bizarre in itself.

I just hope we get to see that forward 3 a few times this season to see how it is.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1i471,t1_jf1bfu6
"At Benfica he played 5 out of 85 games as a LW. They often play with 2 strikers and he played on the left of the 2. 

He isn't a CF in the way Firmino is, but he has all the attributes to go on and be a top striker. That must be what we've signed him for as Diaz is obvs gonna be our LW for the foreseeable.",Liverpool,Yes,jf16thv,t1_jf14smm
You can't say that here. Since we spend loads on him he can't be anything else but a straight laced striker.,Liverpool,Yes,jf15haj,t1_jf14smm
We got 1 point so it‚Äôs progress results wise üòÇ standards on the fooor though,Liverpool,Yes,jf29zi2,t1_jf21xh7
Not really at the start. I think we were very lucky to score the first 2-3 goals and then utd crumbled like how we usually crumble after conceding.,Liverpool,Yes,jf0nizb,t1_jf0ms2r
Perhaps.  But one game we actually look fairly fluid and in another our passing is something more akin to a U-10 team in a youth league.,Liverpool,Yes,jf0rmj2,t1_jf0ms2r
"Also, everyone had a go at Neville (because watching him lose the plot was hilarious) but he wasn't that wrong about it being a freak result - the entire side lost their heads completely in the second half once the second goal went in. It was sort of a freak result.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0u8p2,t1_jf0ms2r
Forgetting Bournemouth?,Liverpool,Yes,jf0ynpq,t1_jf0ns8x
Don't get that either. Why waste 6 months of his season in the wrong position,Liverpool,Yes,jf10ppe,t1_jf10bg6
I think it's to give us options. 433 with a false 9 and 433 with a striker. The only player in our front 3 who is irreplaceable is Salah. The rest are on rotation.,Liverpool,Yes,jf0zt4q,t1_jf0zoj0
"He naturally drifted left even in Benefica days and started a lot of games from the left. Even for his national side in the world cup he played on the wings.

But diaz is our best lw easily 

So it will be diaz on the left - Nunez up front and salah on the right.",Liverpool,Yes,jf10jpm,t1_jf0zoj0
They must have a crisis meeting just set to a series every Monday at this point.,Liverpool,Yes,jf19z8u,t1_jf19pa3
Sean is kinda funny at least. Called Kostas a silver FUT card lol,Liverpool,Yes,jf1efsl,t1_jf1cotj
"Yep. Got the message like 2 minutes after posting it. Reporting it can get you sent the username of who sent it ironically. I'm not sure if they were aware that happens.

I'll pass it on to the mods.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1dw4q,t1_jf1drcg
What a stupid take.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1boec,t1_jf1ay02
Wtf is this take üòÇ,Liverpool,Yes,jf1bghk,t1_jf1ay02
r/CatsWhoSmoke,Liverpool,Yes,jf1iext,t1_jf1cla6
"They played a good football, and we played not even deserved to called a football",Liverpool,Yes,jf52dgg,t1_jf3pog5
in terms of transfers?,Liverpool,Yes,jf3nnek,t1_jf3my00
"Peter Schmeichel is widely regarded as the greatest PL keeper ahead of Cech. Rightly so in my opinion. Could see Ali sneaking into the top 3 ahead of Seaman, De Gea, Van der Sar etc... if he stays long enough but going to be difficult to dislodge the first two.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1izhj,t1_jf1h2h2
">Don‚Äôt think his political leanings help

Literally has no baring on it whatsoever haha. If you are judging players ability of their political views you need to give your head a serious wobble.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1rxq7,t1_jf1ma3d
We can‚Äôt beat the smaller teams though,Liverpool,Yes,jf1z1cc,t1_jf1vmkf
"Exactly where I am at. I'd honestly would not mind a shot at giving winning Europa a chance. It's a nice trophy to win and a meaningful enough tournament. 

However I can't be arsed with a Conference League spot.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0wzrz,t1_jf0vjov
"Haha Penninkangas? Yeah, unfortunately we had to start him today due to sudden injuries. 

We were so shit last season that he was the 2nd best goal scorer in our team. So he gained a bit of a meme-legend status.

‚ÄùYou may have millions, but we have a Penni (penny)‚Äù",Liverpool,Yes,jf2asln,t1_jf28go5
Weirder things have happened. Madrid and Munich are no great shakes currently. Can‚Äôt see them beating either ManCity over two legs or Napoli over one though,Liverpool,Yes,jf36i2q,t1_jf31mmg
If we win all our games we‚Äôll definitely get top 4 but we also definitely won‚Äôt win all our games.,Liverpool,Yes,jf3d0mg,t1_jf3bp3m
One shot at Target which kepa parried and then Tsmikas wasted the resultant corner with a shit cross.,Liverpool,Yes,jf0qe5n,t1_jf0otbj
"The Neil mellor winner game they were brilliant and still lost to us 
Anfield can take a game away from teams in the blink of an eye 
The city team used get blitzed even when we were shit with Andy caroll we won 3-0 üòÇ
Our home form is title contender level which is weird af but our away form is the worst in the league",Liverpool,Yes,jf2aeva,t1_jf1wq3p
"I don't know what he was signed to play

Maybe next season his link up play gets better and he can play central forward

But for now I feel like that's impossible especially with current midfield",Liverpool,Yes,jf1islj,t1_jf1ie5j
"And Nunez currently underperforms his xG  so not everything goes according to the plan

I just don't think that Klopp or who ever is responsible for tactics sits down and says hey let's play them in weaker position for whatever reason",Liverpool,Yes,jf21j09,t1_jf1ztdf
I cannot tell you the amount of times my blood pressure rose when watching Hendo and Fabinho ball watching and being so slow to second balls. It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt even realise that there are opposition players on the pitch that‚Äôll contest for the ball.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1zbho,t1_jf1wkhh
I think he ends up at Newcastle,Liverpool,Yes,jf2w7x1,t1_jf2q6rw
"Your other comment wasn‚Äôt going too well so you decided to try again? Fair enough. I‚Äôm literally asking people to talk me out of thinking it, rather than trying to present it as fact like you did.",Liverpool,Yes,jf19qvl,t1_jf19e0x
How does this explain investing 40 odd million on Gakpo in Jan but doing nothing to address the midfield. I love Cody and I'm glad we have him but was that really the priority after seeing how the first half of the season has gone?,Liverpool,Yes,jf1ehx2,t1_jf1cd21
So Klopp had nothing to do with that?,Liverpool,Yes,jf17wxl,t1_jf17p8q
"The difference is, back then the problem was clear. Injuries was having a domino effect on the entire squad. And while I think Klopp can be criticized that season for persisting with the Highline with the likes of Nat, Rhys and Ozan Kabak, you knew that once we had fit CBs things will get back to normal.

Now my fear is Klopp himself isn't too ruthless to pull the plug on some of these lads who are finished. He wanted to renew Firmino's contract, he wants to renew Milner's contract. He singled out Henderson and Fabinho for praise when it's clear that both have been awful (I understand that they're your only options now so you've got to start them but singling them out to praise was odd). His comments about why the need to sign midfielders in the summer, his erratic in game subs that usually make us worse somehow and the fact that we concede big quality chances like crazy at a rate that only the relegation threatened teams do (something we didn't have at the pandemic season) makes me fear he might not be ruthless enough in the summer.

Trust me, I am not Klopp out or anything and want him to stay and oversee the rebuild. It's that right now, I have more questions than answers when it comes to his decisions.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0qqd6,t1_jf0q6ej
"I might be wrong, but I don't think we have the midfielders for a 4-2-4 at the moment haha",Liverpool,Yes,jf2k298,t1_jf2jc4v
"It‚Äôd be so funny, right? 

Criticising players or the manager is so plastic, too much credit in the bank for any of that.",Liverpool,Yes,jf11jf6,t1_jf11933
Salah literally scored at the Etihad.,Liverpool,Yes,jf2i6tp,t1_jf2cygc
‚Ä¶Salah scored?,Liverpool,Yes,jf2f0nr,t1_jf2cygc
Nah Fabinho could have had a couple last night. Van Dijk against Bournemouth. Salah scored against City. Nunez literally hasn‚Äôt had a sniff.,Liverpool,Yes,jf2d7mm,t1_jf2cygc
Salah,Liverpool,Yes,jf2d6b6,t1_jf2cygc
"I agree fully but there‚Äôs not a single club in the top 5 leagues who‚Äôd pay money for him. Unless he is willing to go to the championship and take a huge pay cut, he‚Äôs not going anywhere until he retires or runs down his contract",Liverpool,Yes,jf1ltmt,t1_jf1jfr1
There‚Äôs no way they are selling hendo. He is homegrown talent. He will become part of the squad like Milner.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1v1bb,t1_jf1jfr1
especially him. Milner can stay for leaderships. Man is nearin 50 and still gives a shit,Liverpool,Yes,jf1ldt4,t1_jf1jfr1
He was fucking woeful the short term memory loss after poor performances in this sub is insane. People think because we didn't concede he done well. He was absolutely ass and offered nothing offensively or defensively. We kept a cleansheet because Chelsea's attack is somehow worse than our midfield and defence.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1g91q,t1_jf1e22e
I think we are all masochist at this point,Liverpool,Yes,jf1egwm,t1_jf1d1ap
">If...then things are really bad

That's not where I draw the line, things are already REALLY bad, but the boys seem to always have a stellar performance every now and then this season, it's like they suddenly remember they're some of the best in the world for one game and then get Space Jam'd the very next game",Liverpool,Yes,jf103mi,t1_jf0ztkh
People are so precious about the whole hendo/Ali thing. As if Ali is going to get all upset and leave over it. It's a high pressure work environment. Tempers get frayed occasionally. No big deal.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1228b,t1_jf0y7wr
It‚Äôs quite literally 95% of the conversation surrounding this club at all times hahahaha I have full faith on him bouncing back it‚Äôs some of the others I‚Äôm worried about ngl,Liverpool,Yes,jf1ubky,t1_jf1tqu0
People constantly talk about his defending. Not about the fact his majestic long balls and crosses are in the gutter.,Liverpool,Yes,jf2pktc,t1_jf1tqu0
"Yeah, been constantly saying that to others about confidence. You can clearly see it in the team's passing among other things.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1ui9h,t1_jf1pyan
Plus Klopp has said before Trent‚Äôs being instructed to play so far forward. This team changes with a competent midfield,Liverpool,Yes,jf2ds9i,t1_jf1upw8
"You're not wrong, but also we just aren't finishing the chances. I think Trent is only behind De Bruyne for big chances created this season but only one of them has been put away",Liverpool,Yes,jf1rob4,t1_jf1p5h9
He is being sarcastic can't you guys tell.,Liverpool,Yes,jf13in8,t1_jf135rf
A joke üòÇ,Liverpool,Yes,jf36o1e,t1_jf35hfb
I think the buyback can‚Äôt be activated until 2024?,Liverpool,Yes,jf4x9mp,t1_jf4w49c
I commented that way before they scored,Liverpool,Yes,jf3rcdz,t1_jf3r626
"fucking hate comments like the above. Pure Twitter culture. Everything has to be either the best or the worst. I can guarantee you, if we do have a good summer these same people will say were winning the league with 110 pts and Klopp will stay for the next 20 years.",Liverpool,Yes,jf32lk4,t1_jf2yvmf
"And do you trust FSG to give us the funding we need to rebuild this squad? Your probly an FSG dick rider anyway, my point was that knowing FSG they will more or less give us fuck all spending so thats why id rather use the funds on more than one player.",Liverpool,Yes,jf325n2,t1_jf2yvmf
"Well ox keita or 100% gone, fabinho probly get sold, milner might go and hendo jones elliot dont really look great tbh, so id say there would need to be at least 3.",Liverpool,Yes,jf37u17,t1_jf36so9
Lmao he‚Äôs got a throwaway account for commenting on rivals subs and reddit porn,Liverpool,Yes,jf3ukr5,t1_jf3rdv5
"The reason they don't get game time is they aren't up to par, so both those options don't count. Gakpo is serviceable there but not where he should play and Elliott is 2-3 seasons from being PL ready. We have players we force into the role, but they aren't actual 10s.",Liverpool,Yes,jf2s6tr,t1_jf2jfa6
"Like 99% of that list is literally names people have commented saying they like, or saying they‚Äôve seen links somewhere with zero backing to it.",Liverpool,Yes,jf2kxcb,t1_jf2j5j0
lmao we don't need another 8? We have zero effective players in that role. Talking out your arse.,Liverpool,Yes,jf2rv1u,t1_jf2j5j0
There‚Äôs no guarantee our team is back to their best after the summer. Also we‚Äôve seen how fast players can decline. VVD and Fab went from being the two best in the world in their position to being average within a few months. I doubt the same will happen to Alisson but it‚Äôs not impossible,Liverpool,Yes,jf0ztum,t1_jf0zi4t
Probably. But I also thought VVD would continue at a high level till he‚Äôs 34/35,Liverpool,Yes,jf0zzgl,t1_jf0zlu7
"You think Alisson gives a fuck about a golden glove award, which he‚Äôs won multiple times already, when we‚Äôre playing shit? I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd much rather get top 4 than win the golden glove",Liverpool,Yes,jf0zxja,t1_jf0zps0
"There is zero chance we bought Nunez to play a Man√© esque left sided role. Klopp explicitly said he was a ""real 9"" when we signed him. 

The ""missing piece"" quote was about the Dutch team, btw, not Liverpool.",Liverpool,Yes,jf3uf6e,t1_jf3r2lv
"I see why Gakpo is playing centrally, his ability to turn on the ball, retain it under pressure and drive at the opposition from between the lines makes him a good fit as a false 9, we saw that against United.

When Nunez was playing centrally we couldn't break the lines, it's not his game, he wants to be played in behind and attack the box. It also stretched our play too much since when Nunez plays central we go long, and then our midfield is too disconnected from the attack.

That's not his fault, we knew his profile when we signed him, I was certain we were signing him with a view to changing our style of play, perhaps with a 10 to connect with him, as most strikers like him need, but we didn't do that and we now have a situation where we have lots of talent in attack but not a clear idea of how to use them.",Liverpool,Yes,jf3hzrz,t1_jf3gsuo
"Yes it's almost like Bayern didn't actually watch Mane's last year with us and thought they were getting 2016 Mane

But I don't think he will start in the middle infront of Chupo-Moting, Musiala, and Muller, so I really don't know why they bought him",Liverpool,Yes,jf1rqby,t1_jf1p5yu
"hey, keep saying this ""gini was poor in his last year"" 

Who was actually good that year, we scraped top 4, the entire team was bad.  And its far worse now.

At least he played 35 + games every single year he was here, unlike keita/thiago who can barely play 10 in a row.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1si4d,t1_jf1oiqp
"Fab has been given enough chances. The best he looked this season was 1 maybe 2 games alongside Bajcetic and Elliott, and even then he was just OK. It's been long enough, we can't have another season of this. Doesn't need to be sold but he can't be our starting DM anymore",Liverpool,Yes,jf1radd,t1_jf144wc
Gets away with it? What a load of fucking nonsense haha. Jones is one of the most criticised players in the squad.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1owwu,t1_jf128aq
As would Onana.,Liverpool,Yes,jf18kt4,t1_jf18j6v
"...er yes, i know lol

but he didn't start last night",Liverpool,Yes,jf167qc,t1_jf14gr8
"Obviously they have better quality players but last year we actually had good rotation for most of the year only Trent salah and Van dijk played basically all the matches and even at that they didn‚Äôt play a lot of the cup matches especially the early ones. 

Then this year bar the midfield we have basically the same squad but I‚Äôd argue getting gakpo and nunez has strengthened the attack and we‚Äôre worse. 

They in theory should be better equipped to deal with attacking on all fronts due to this and that‚Äôs true but it doesn‚Äôt give us a viable excuse to fall off a cliff the way we have.",Liverpool,Yes,jf19q59,t1_jf18ogf
Curtis passing back to a still limping Konate did have me laughing like I'd finally gone mad,Liverpool,Yes,jf1fiq1,t1_jf1e4rj
"Hence, I wouldn't use him as a starter. He'd be 4th choice and rotated in and actually played as a playmaker rather than a box-to-box destroyer, which is what we've had to turn him into due to our lack of ability in the middle of the park. If his minutes are managed correctly, he can still offer us something. The others, however, absolutely cannot.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1b5ij,t1_jf1ay40
Not suited for our system,Liverpool,Yes,jf3jxlg,t1_jf3jqzk
"Probably, or maybe some details are left to be ironed out, so they don't want to jump the gun.",Liverpool,Yes,jf11pg0,t1_jf11l0f
It was mentioned in the Q and A section of his latest Athletic article. Some quotes are flying around on twitter.,Liverpool,Yes,jf12rrx,t1_jf12o48
I hope those GIC rumours are true. I checked them out and they are loaded. Rivals Abu Dhabi money.,Liverpool,Yes,jf14suq,t1_jf14dry
Why? If we get external investment why not.,Liverpool,Yes,jf15e20,t1_jf14pvz
"It‚Äôs about moving the ball, we really can‚Äôt move it well enough. Allowing Thiago to really thrive again so it‚Äôll give us a better mentality in having a grip managing games. 

Either way, 3 or 2 we‚Äôre going to get overrun in midfield. There‚Äôs nothing fixing that at the minute but may as well look to fix other areas",Liverpool,Yes,jf0vle4,t1_jf0vet9
[deleted],Liverpool,Yes,jf3rj7e,t1_jf3oufx
"We do know that about Jones though, his ceiling has been MOTM performances in CL games at the age of 19/20. I think people forget just how good he has been and how much injuries have slowed his progress.",Liverpool,Yes,jf11hc1,t1_jf0xigi
Time is relative.,Liverpool,Yes,jf3cbob,t1_jf360ro
"For a pressing striker it is, it would be different if was a poacher but as a false 9, 31 is old",Liverpool,Yes,jf6cv54,t1_jf360ro
he just came back from injuries,Liverpool,Yes,jf1dimh,t1_jf1d5yt
You have to look at mins played rather than say 30 games. Even 5 mins at the end of the match is counted as a match played.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1e5hc,t1_jf1d5yt
"We're starting him because of his defensive work, movement, ball carrying etc.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1ipua,t1_jf1d5yt
But he‚Äôs saying he wants Arsenal to lose the league to a Rodri decision like we did. The only Rodri decision I can think of that would affect Arsenal‚Äôs title pursuit is the one last week against us,Liverpool,Yes,jf246ag,t1_jf2363r
"He was like that when he was brought in but then I felt that his technical qualities are good and he is capable of keeping the ball under pressure. Some tactical development in terms of positioning and supporting the build up and he will be a good player. But there has been no development. Ran into blind alleys then and still does the same. Midfield is 70% positioning and if that can‚Äôt be sorted, he will always be poor.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0trem,t1_jf0p4ej
"My bad for engaging with you in good faith. You clearly aren't interested. Don't speak about thinking critically when you make responses like this and out yourself as someone who probably only has been around for the success Klopp has brought to us, hence your level of insane entitlement. I'm not pretending to be a ""better fan"" than anyone, it's a reminder of what we were before him since I witnessed it for decades. If you didn't I wouldn't blame you for that, but you have chosen to take that personally.

I gave you a comment full of critical thinking and experience, you've chosen to be offended by that and make arguments I never made. Relegation? You want to make stupid remarks like that and yap about critical thinking and watching games? 

What an insecure joke your entire reply is.",Liverpool,Yes,jf17urd,t1_jf17kfs
I recall he had a really good run of games a couple of seasons ago. The odd injuries haven't help him at all.,Liverpool,Yes,jf12l12,t1_jf0zgy6
Feels insane to say but imo Milner is currently our best midfielder (accounting for availability too),Liverpool,Yes,jf1ug7s,t1_jf1i5ad
"I agree with you. I think the club did him a disservice by not loaning him out to a championship team when he was younger.

I think he probably needs to be sold. But if there was any point in his Liverpool career to show up and show why he should be here from now to the end of the season is massive for him.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0xsh0,t1_jf0xki7
"Yeah I don't get how Klopp had him playing upfront and he was making all the chances etc.

Now he is on the left wing to counter.",Liverpool,Yes,jf18s4n,t1_jf16273
So basically everything you said to agree with the fact he comes off the left in every attacking position he‚Äôs played,Liverpool,Yes,jf1dmbm,t1_jf16thv
From watching him in our last few games do you honestly think LW is his best position?,Liverpool,Yes,jf16uty,t1_jf15haj
"You're right, but in a way, they're shit for not scoring after 2 big chances",Liverpool,Yes,jf0p1rd,t1_jf0nizb
But it's interesting both sides haven't had a win ever since that game. Both united and us have collected one point. It's almost like they are as bad as us.,Liverpool,Yes,jf0v9cu,t1_jf0u8p2
"That was because that Bournemouth side we're beyond dire under parker rather than us playing particularly well. We were fine, but it wasn't like we were dazzling or anything.",Liverpool,Yes,jf14kkm,t1_jf0ynpq
"It isn't his wrong position. He played on the left for Benefica as well, plenty of games and does the same for Uruguay, even in the world cup he was being utilised on the wings.

Where else will you find space to run with the ball, he is a bit like Jesus in that regard, he was also utilised on the wings plenty of times.

Nunez isn't the silkiest of players to play in the center where he can control the ball and manipulate it to make runs. It's very crowded there, he naturally drifts left anyways even when he plays in the center.",Liverpool,Yes,jf10xsx,t1_jf10ppe
It will be Diaz-Gakpo-Salah with Nunez off the bench unless we switch to a 4-2-3-1. You can already tell Klopp doesn‚Äôt rate Nunez as much as the fans do with how he brings him off first every game,Liverpool,Yes,jf11up6,t1_jf10jpm
absurd lol. hope you‚Äôre ok man!,Liverpool,Yes,jf1dylb,t1_jf1dw4q
Report them then. Also name and shame.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1e7nj,t1_jf1dw4q
"Isak, Guimaraes, and Joelinton earlier on have been immense. Guimaraes is a more versatile Fabinho. Isak is similar to Darwin. And Joelinton is like a Milner / more of a brute in midfield. And Trippier who has been a gem for them. Doubt anyone expected him to play *that* well. They‚Äôve stuck with their previous players like Almiron and Saint Max who have done their part, some more than others. And they‚Äôve solidified their back line by adding the likes of vets like Burn, and solid youngsters like Botman.",Liverpool,Yes,jf4aq8k,t1_jf3nnek
For sure. I prefer Cech to Schmeichel but those are the two people agree on.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1oi71,t1_jf1izhj
I‚Äôm sure many of the players have interesting political views and you may not agree with them. Liverpool is a global club that attracts the world class players from all over the world. These players all have different cultures and views. They‚Äôre here to play football. End of story.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1x9zn,t1_jf1rxq7
If one of our players came out and said they supported Nigel Farage we as a fan base would not be happy at all and rightly so. Not sure why it‚Äôs any different if it‚Äôs. Brazilian liking a right wing nut,Liverpool,Yes,jf27mnk,t1_jf1rxq7
"Yea, Buffon is an absolute right wing nut and nobody has stopped calling him one of the best keepers of all time.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1x2gm,t1_jf1rxq7
Or anyone away from home,Liverpool,Yes,jf29elp,t1_jf1z1cc
"I still think he needs to be in the middle, he has insane pace to stretch defenders running in behind and his touch has looked much better over the course of the season. He‚Äôs certainly not a Firmino type but he is at least an instinctive and enigmatic player with great physical attributes for a striker. Plus with Diaz coming back he surely has to be in the middle.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1tfnm,t1_jf1islj
He was signed to be our striker. he played 80 out of 85 games for Benfica as a ST. It's pretty obvious what he was signed for tbh.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1rswr,t1_jf1islj
"They can't seem to match anyone for pace, strength etc it's shockingly bad. Not seen either of them get the better of anyone for ages.",Liverpool,Yes,jf219ch,t1_jf1zbho
"I am looking at his actions while you are taking his words at 100 percent truth which is a very naive way to go about things. All managers manipulate things. Learn to think critically for yourself..

Melo has played 13 mins in full campaign where all the Midfielders have been injured and has been on the bench for the last two games but never has come on. 

If this is not an indication of him not being in his plans then what is?",Liverpool,Yes,jf19ws2,t1_jf19qvl
"Cody seems like planning ahead to give us the same dynamic as Firmino once he leaves. So I‚Äôm isolation that transfer makes perfect sense. 

But for sure it doesn‚Äôt explain why they didn‚Äôt address the midfield problem. All I can say is that our results last year convinced people that our squad was perfectly fine. Even though it‚Äôs my opinion that we dropped needless points in the league due to a lack of midfield resources, maybe we could beaten city otherwise. And a similar story in the champions league final when we had no one to come in for Thiago after getting injured in the warm up. 

But as I said I think this stems from the end of the 20/21 season and since then Klopp is being deliberately stubborn to make his point about transfers. Hence why he played Arthur for 7 minutes then sent him to play with the U23s and we haven‚Äôt seen him since.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1flgd,t1_jf1ehx2
No he never wanted him. Just like he never wanted Ben Davies. Both were signed after he complained.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1884y,t1_jf17wxl
"If it helps just think all the midfielders are injured this time and will come back only when the next season starts. 

And stop listening to Klopp's press conferences or his post match interviews it only drive you nuts. 

The team might come back or not but you will lose your sanity lol nothing is gonna happen until the season ends. Just ten games to go.",Liverpool,Yes,jf0r8l8,t1_jf0qqd6
The midfield would be exactly the same as in the formation you posted.,Liverpool,Yes,jf2tcdp,t1_jf2k298
"true ,but maybe we could skip the midfield when building up for attacks?",Liverpool,Yes,jf2k999,t1_jf2k298
As long as we win who cares what is plastic or not plastic. I don't hate Milner for his age anyways. He doesn't let the side down at least this season.,Liverpool,Yes,jf11nh7,t1_jf11jf6

"His legs are gone but I‚Äôd keep him for leadership too, he‚Äôd be good at whipping newcomers into shape. Hendo is done though.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1ltni,t1_jf1ldt4
I thought he did okay. He didn't make any major errors and was able to keep up with the Chelsea wingers. You know who was terrible? Tsimikas and Matip. But nobody talks about it because they are fan favorites.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1h1e1,t1_jf1g91q
"There were a few nervy moments, but he stuck to his task and also came closest to scoring.

Honestly wouldn't object to him starting at RB against Chelsea, especially against Martinelli who rinsed Trent at the Emirates earlier this season.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1i5ma,t1_jf1g91q
"Yeap it's pathetic. Klopp took him into the 1st team since he was 17/18 his whole senior career he's played extremely high up the pitch with Gini and Hendo protecting him. It's the same reason Robertson has been nullified so much. Our fullbacks are trying to adapt their playstyle this season, to protect the defence. Anytime they try go forward they can't even rely on Van Dijk, Fabinho, or Matip anymore, nevermind the 2 centre mids.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1w3nl,t1_jf1ubky
Just isn't true he's still world class at passing but whatever suits your agenda,Liverpool,Yes,jf3bgow,t1_jf2pktc
"There‚Äôs players that have just regressed and dropped off massively like Fabinho and Hendo, while most of the other are just struggling with confidence.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1wuwd,t1_jf1ui9h
Love that,Liverpool,Yes,jf374zx,t1_jf36o1e
You are correct I was not aware it's 2024. I would 100% be all over him and Walker-Peters if Saints go down,Liverpool,Yes,jf6cfcp,t1_jf4x9mp

"What do you mean aren't up to par? We haven't even seen them play there.

Gakpo's best performances this season came when he was playing as a false 9 which is very similar to the way you'd play an attacking midfielder.

Elliott, similarly to Carvalho and Jones, has barely ever played as a 10 for us and has been used as a box to box midfielder (which is something he's not suited to). 

And saying we force players into an attacking mid role is wrong because we DO NOT PLAY WITH AN ATTACKING MID. 

Adding Maddison would be redundant and a waste of money.",Liverpool,Yes,jf2tbn3,t1_jf2s6tr
Clearly meant 10,Liverpool,Yes,jf37uda,t1_jf2rv1u
"It's not, but simultaneously after a summer break, reinforcements to boost morale, there's no reason why form won't improve. 

This season has been much less strenuous than last season, especially after January, given the lack of progression in cups, so players should be a bit more rejuvenated.",Liverpool,Yes,jf109i9,t1_jf0ztum
You could have said the same thing about 2021 and the next season we nearly did the quadruple.,Liverpool,Yes,jf13fra,t1_jf0ztum
"You act like there is no reason in the world for vvd to drop in performance. 
Find me one player on last years team that is preforming day in and day out besides Alisson?
Easy to be blindsided as fans and expect them to preform like gladiators every game but it‚Äôs clear there is a massive dark cloud over the team.
Is it mental? Physical? Hard to say but injuries have a huge mental toll and being out so long and then having to preform like you do while keeping the mental sharp is not a easy feat.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1048v,t1_jf0ztum
It isn‚Äôt Virgil‚Äôs fault that an idiot dino decided to charge at him and split his knee. I still think Virgil will be fine next season with a proper midfield in front of him.,Liverpool,Yes,jf145da,t1_jf0zzgl
Outfield players and goalkeepers are completely different. Alisson is only JUST entering his prime years now. Cannot remotely begin to compare him to VVD.,Liverpool,Yes,jf10i1t,t1_jf0zzgl
"VVD will be back next season. The whole squad including Klopp has a psychological hangover from last season / it being a world cup year. Summer will give the lads some time off to refocus, rest, reset and add some new faces to the mix. Boys will be back and smashing it.",Liverpool,Yes,jf10eqw,t1_jf0zzgl
We probably are missing Mane pressing he was one of the best at but the idea that this season would be completely different if we hadn‚Äôt sold is just wrong,Liverpool,Yes,jf1v856,t1_jf1rqby
"I mean that was kind of my point. Any of fab, hendo and thiago are fine suad players, but shouldn't be the lynchpin at any point unless things dramatically change form/fitness wise.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1v107,t1_jf1radd
docoure as well. Evertons midfield is legit miles better than ours,Liverpool,Yes,jf1budc,t1_jf18kt4
"Oh I know I just wanted to repeat that lol some visiting Arsenal fans might think the crown has gone to saka. 

Their fans are obsessed with salah vs saka on twitter.",Liverpool,Yes,jf16d4m,t1_jf167qc
"The core of our team has been put through the ringer, though. You have to admit. 

From 2018 until last year there was really only one major change to our preferred starting line up every week and that was when Wijnaldum chose to leave. Barring injuries, of which we have several notable injury prone players, if you can name an unchanged squad for half a decade playing 60 games a season it's likely going to take its toll.

We also play differently to City. Our play is more physical and stamina based and theirs is usually around possession and making wearing the opposition out by dragging them around the pitch.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1aczn,t1_jf19q59
"I completely lost it at that moment, it‚Äôs like they are trying their hardest to trigger us",Liverpool,Yes,jf1kjxr,t1_jf1fiq1
"That was essentially his role in his first season. IIRC correctly he and Henderson played roughly the same amount of games, they were our 3rd and 4th most played CMs. I think that role works well for him. 

For the record, I don‚Äôt think we need to sell everyone except Thiago. But I do think we need to move on from our midfielders who aren‚Äôt fit enough to play. Thiago‚Äôs 20-25 games a season is just about enough to be a contribution but I think it will be night day difference if we can put 2 world class/ available players in for Keita and Ox",Liverpool,Yes,jf1d8wx,t1_jf1b5ij
"He‚Äôd be decent Salah back up and he‚Äôs quite talented, if he‚Äôs cheap and they get relegated it‚Äôs not the worst, could probably sell for a higher price later on as well",Liverpool,Yes,jf3p3my,t1_jf3jxlg

I‚Äôm just taking a guess based on our previous windows.,Liverpool,Yes,jf15isn,t1_jf15e20
"I don‚Äôt think our actual passing ability is the issue though, it‚Äôs more to do with general mobility I‚Äôd say. We can‚Äôt press effectively with those two alone and we don‚Äôt have anyone to play the 10 to help them out any differently to what we‚Äôve been trying. The only player we have who seems to be able to run for 90 minutes is Elliot and he‚Äôs obviously lacking in the defensive side and can be muscled off the ball fairly easily. Both Thiago and Fabinho have had an engine type next to them when they‚Äôve been deployed in a double pivot and without that seems a disaster waiting to happen. Thiago is great at tackling but he is so slow, always injured, and is just as guilty as Trent of watching at times as an attack has gone past him. Fabs is obviously struggling himself generally this season and has always run like he was 48.",Liverpool,Yes,jf14e1q,t1_jf0vle4
My hope is Diaz and Thiago change our fortunes,Liverpool,Yes,jf3uubs,t1_jf3rj7e
"the problem is, this isn't fifa where a player can miss so much time in development out through injury and illness and just pick up where they left off, with no hiccups to their progress

regardless of the reason, he *has* missed loads of key time that you'd expect a 19/20 year to improve in, and he *has* therefore stagnated. In fact, I'd argue he's actually worse now than he was then

Jack Wilshere's ceiling was taking it to best-in-the-world Barcelona for a top 4-at-best Arsenal, and then when he was in his ""prime"" years he couldn't get games in for Championship Bournemouth

Its not always linear",Liverpool,Yes,jf13kct,t1_jf11hc1
How dare he not score in his first game back. He has the third highest assist this season isn't that something?,Liverpool,Yes,jf1fzim,t1_jf1dimh

"Yeh that's it, the problem is when he is on the wing if we aren't countering (which is most games) than he's anonymous. 

Just hope we get at least a few games of Diaz-Nunez-Salah this season",Liverpool,Yes,jf19b24,t1_jf18s4n
What I'm saying is. He's a striker not a winger. 'coming off the left' doesn't mean they suit being out wide. Most strikers will naturally favour going one side over the other. It's completely different to being isolated on the touchline.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1hq9m,t1_jf1dmbm
"His first touch and skill on the ball to turn and make space for himself  isn't good enough in the league to play as a striker at the moment, unless the whole gameplay is to play on the counter or against a high line team. 

Look how natural Gakpo is with the ball at his feet, he manipulates his body movement well to make space and drive forward with the ball. Play ones- two as well. 

I don't see that in Nunez game as of yet. Outwide at least he can utilise his pace on the counter, that's what  Mbappe, salah and saka do, that's where space is otherwise he will get marked easily out of games.

Like lewa before him Klopp has to work with Nunez to develop his gameplay and will take some time. 

Nunez's best game this season have come on the left.",Liverpool,Yes,jf17d3m,t1_jf16uty

"The thing that people aren't getting is that we signed him to play the mane position essentially. It doesn't look like that currently because the midfield is so ineffective that he's having to do so much tracking back, so looks like a traditional left winger. 

Once again, a symptom of everything else being in fucking tatters around him.",Liverpool,Yes,jf11agc,t1_jf10xsx
"DrIfting around the 18 yard box and playing out wide are totally different though. Once a team forces him towards the touchline he just isn't effective. 

Getting Diaz back will be important. Will give us more of an insight to what we are doing up top.

There‚Äôs no reason for them to take him though. He‚Äôs genuinely a championship level player so there‚Äôs no reason for a premier league team to pay any money for him when he‚Äôs 33 and on high wages.

True but doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs going to happen again. Hence why I said there‚Äôs ‚Äòno guarantee‚Äô it happens,Liverpool,Yes,jf143iz,t1_jf13fra
Exactly. There‚Äôs every reason for Alisson to be mentally drained after this season hence why there‚Äôs a chance his performances decline next season even if we have an actual team around him,Liverpool,Yes,jf10acv,t1_jf1048v
"It‚Äôs hard to judge when he entered his prime years tbh because he‚Äôs been world class since we signed him. But it‚Äôs not rare for a goalkeeper to have seasons where they perform poorly even if they are in their prime years. Look at Ter Stegen and Oblak, they are in their prime years and have been two of the best in the world but last season both of them were absolutely shite. This season they‚Äôve improved but it‚Äôs not impossible that Alisson sees a big drop in performance levels especially after carrying the team this season",Liverpool,Yes,jf10wo5,t1_jf10i1t
"Hopefully. But it‚Äôs clear that VVD has lost a yard of pace. That‚Äôs not a mental thing, that‚Äôs just physical decline",Liverpool,Yes,jf10jc1,t1_jf10eqw
"Yeah I agree but I would also attribute the blame to us for this. 

We were stagnant I talk about it 24/7 but the summer transfer window after we won the CL was a sign that this was going to be the core squad and that‚Äôs all there is to it. 

No ambition to evolve or stay on top. A combination of Klopp loyalties and Owner frugalness but look at how city bought and sold Raheem sterling Ferran Torres Gabriel Jesus etc etc they‚Äôve actually made money overall on a lot of their players and the profit and loss looks healthy just in terms of players the last couple years. 

Yeah I know they built their squad core with ridiculous spending 5/6 years ago but how they maintained it in the years that followed has been commendable. 

We just sat back assuming everyone was gonna be at their peak till they‚Äôre 34 and hoping we get a few more Coutinho Esque sales so we can replace key areas. 

It was a puzzling method of maintaining a sell to buy culture. 

And we have mentally been out through the ringer but I‚Äôd also argue city have had a lot of that with how they‚Äôve been tossed out of the champion league even losing a final to a team that on paper they should‚Äôve beaten. Obviously in the league they haven‚Äôt faced the hardship we‚Äôve had but the way they got knocked out of the CL against Ys Spurs and Real Madrid must have hurt in the same regard yet they‚Äôre still on top.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1az8v,t1_jf1aczn
"Klopp won't know how to use him. He plays Gakpo a winger, central and Nunez a CF, wide",Liverpool,Yes,jf3wq81,t1_jf3p3my

I can understand but that's 12 games less than 30 everyone keeps quoting.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1kxku,t1_jf1kmby
">His first touch and skill on the ball to turn and make space for himself  isn't good enough in the league to play as a striker at the moment,

That's the exact reason he isn't good enough for the wing. You don't have to have the best first touch or be the best dribbler to be a striker. But when you are receiving the ball with your back to goal on the touchline with a RB/RW/CM all on you straight away, that's where you need that close control. 

Gakpo is totally different yes I agree but again I'd say Gakpo's strengths are more needed out wide haha.

Nunez's runs in behind, his aerial ability, his movement, strength and pace all make him a real threat upfront, I only see pace as a strength on the wing. You can't compare him to the likes of Mbappe, Salah and Saka as they are all natural wingers with great dribbling ability, which Nunez simply doesn't posses.

You say Nunez's best games come from him playing on the left which probably makes sense as he's played more for us on the left since Gakpo come in and made us a better team. But in them games how many good things did he do from actual being on the wing? Look at his G/A nearly every single one comes from him getting into the box and being inbetween the posts.",Liverpool,Yes,jf17zo1,t1_jf17d3m
"I don't think they even make the top four this season. They lost the chance to consolidate the spot and have tough fixtures coming up. 

Their squad looks tired and has too many cup games left to play. They may make cl through Europa league though.",Liverpool,Yes,jf108dn,t1_jf0zblt
Rashfords purple patch has made them look far better than they are. Take his goals out of the side and they'd probably be down with us and Chelsea.,Liverpool,Yes,jf14u07,t1_jf0zblt
"Yeah that and we are working on his first touch and skillset to keep the ball which isn't great. Look at Gakpo and how natural he is to him to  manipulate the ball in tight spaces. 

Nunez can't do that in the center yet. I wouldn't judge him from yesterdays game chelsea essentially applied a low block to stifle us.",Liverpool,Yes,jf11gsa,t1_jf11agc
">DrIfting around the 18 yard box and playing out wide are totally different though. Once a team forces him towards the touchline he just isn't effective.

He played about 20 games from the lw position for Benefica and started all world cup games out wide. Out wide is where he can use his pace to run. 

In the center he will get marked down by center backs and he doesn't have the silk touches to make space for himself. Not yet anyways.

It's not surprising all speedsters in Europe play out wide from salah to mbappe to saka. There is where you find space to operate. 

>Getting Diaz back will be important. Will give us more of an insight to what we are doing up top.

I agree but then again diaz didn't have a great relationship with Robbo on the left they kept running into each other's space.

"IDK why you're being downvoted for that.

Jota hasn't been great but it's hardly surprising is it......

No preseason, missed start of season, came back for a couple games, gets injured, misses world cup, come's back playing different position each game in part of different front 3's and in a poor team.

"Wasn't the argument used against not starting Gakpo on the left was that he doesn't have pace for the Liverpool system?

"And he still looked the most dangerous player for us.

I can't wait to see him when we have gakpo receiving the ball 10 yards further forward, Then releasing Nunez. They're getting the ball too far back currently for it to be a real opportunity.",Liverpool,Yes,jf11q9w,t1_jf11gsa

True but Darwin doesn't have the skill set those boys have. Mbappe and Salah blow past people with pace and quick feet. Darwin has the pace but his dribbling out wide isn't good.

"Our definition of significant might be different to FSGs, it‚Äôs a broad statement for a reason. We need 300 million in the summer and that shouldn‚Äôt be used to spunk half on Bellingham, it might sound like a lot but that‚Äôs because FSG have neglected the squad for so long and there is no chance we get that. They‚Äôll give us 150-200 million MAX plus player sales which isn‚Äôt enough. The whole midfield besides Stefan, Elliott and Thiago needs to be booted out the door if we‚Äôre brutally honest and as for defence we need a RB because we bought Ramsay injured. Not to mention two centrebacks to replace Matip and Gomez, that‚Äôs before we even mention we need an attacker to replace firmino. Even then there‚Äôs question marks still if a few are good enough such as tsimikas as much as we love him and Diaz and Jota because of long term injury concerns.",Liverpool,Yes,jf39y77,t1_jf3828h
Who knows. I guess we‚Äôll find out next season,Liverpool,Yes,jf115rg,t1_jf10mob
Milner will write a thesis on it post retirement in Spanish. That is if he ever retires. His contract was tied with Klopp's.,Liverpool,Yes,jf16j21,t1_jf16f7v
Yup every player can't be Haaland for sure. Players need some rhythm to settle down too and you need mins for that.,Liverpool,Yes,jf1uhky,t1_jf1u9pa
">Clearly both have benefited from each other so I don't see what the issue is

The issue is we look shit in attack in more or less every game......

I had seen very little of Gakpo before we signed him, I was at the game for his debut and I was impressed with how neat and tidy he was with with the ball but yes tbh I did think pace was an issue. Since then I've seen more and realised that his good dribbling and ability to travel well with the ball shows why he was so good on the wing for PSV.

Nunez isn't good in tight areas and can't dribble past full backs. It's clear as day. He played against a back 3 last night and couldn't get the better of Fofana once. He can't use his pace to effect with the ball at his feet. Hence why he obviously isn't a winger. 

Like I said previous, everything he's done good for us has come from being central, even when starting on the wing. And a lot of what Gakpo has done good for us like his 1st against UTD has come from him going out to the wing haha. We are losing/drawing most games and look so untidy, why not try them in their preferred positions? We have literally nothing to lose. 

Interested to know what you'd have as our best front 3 injuries aside?",Liverpool,Yes,jf1a2hx,t1_jf19a4v
Yup both haven't played together in some time as well. I am very excited for Gakpo he is like Bobby with better physicality and goals.,Liverpool,Yes,jf11tgh,t1_jf11q9w
">True but Darwin doesn't have the skill set those boys have. Mbappe and Salah blow past people with pace and quick feet. Darwin has the pace but his dribbling out wide isn't good.

I don't know, during the 442 experiment he was showcasing skills out wide. Like when he left Laporte eating dust and ran past him. 

He has an on and off start and hasn't gotten a regular run going. Can't really judge him this season.",Liverpool,Yes,jf132in,t1_jf12u8b
But that's solely down to injuries to Diaz and Jota,Liverpool,Yes,jf1wqlw,t1_jf1w9f2
"100 percent. Is Melo anything like a Klopp signing to you? The man has been at the club for 7 years now and some people here still don't know what kinda players he likes.

Either some people here are naive for a reason or just want to bash on Klopp.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1bloi,t1_jf1b9uc
"What can I do if you can't read between the lines ? And want easy answers.

Full summer they kept talking about the perfect midfielder for the Liverpool system and then went and signed a player who hasn't played much football in two years and was in Juve's reserve.

He comes and plays 13 mins and is on the bench for the last two weeks and never gets any mins for a reason he was never in Klopp's plans.",Liverpool,Yes,jf18lzs,t1_jf18fp1

"Absolutely. He's certainly exciting on the ball, and seems to be one of those transition players who can get the ball in a tight spot, bit of a battle with a cm, then he can turn and suddenly there's massive space in front of him. 

I said yesterday he lookes like a Bobby regen, and that's something I didn't think we'd find.",Liverpool,Yes,jf11wmk,t1_jf11tgh
"When teams push up high it doesn't matter where he is because his pace in behind is ridiculous.

It's when teams sit deep he just doesn't have that flair like a Diaz to go both ways and beat his man.

Im hoping next season in a functional team he can flourish!",Liverpool,Yes,jf13d0a,t1_jf132in
Yes injuries played a part as well but once again we now have almost full squad and I don't think there is a conspiracy to play him on the left so he would play worse,Liverpool,Yes,jf1x8zm,t1_jf1wqlw
"No for real. If Klopp had final say on transfers I don‚Äôt think we would‚Äôve gone into a season with 3 centre backs, with 2 of them being injury prone lol.

I honestly think most people don‚Äôt have a genuine understanding or theory as to what is going wrong at the moment so they are gunning for the key figures. That‚Äôs why we see Trent, Fab, Salah, Henderson and Klopp‚Äôs names being dragged. Not that they‚Äôve necessarily made the best decisions all season, but the problems we are having aren‚Äôt down to individual one off performances - it‚Äôs definitely much much bigger than that.",Liverpool,Yes,jf1cwtg,t1_jf1bloi

"But the only player that effects where Nunez is playing is still yet to make a return. 

No one said anything about any conspiracy?

We play Hendo and Fabinho every game who make us worse. Trent has started 90% of games this season whilst barely having a decent game. 

Jones started last night after not even making the bench for the previous 5 or 6 league games.

The season has been an absolute shambles all round and Klopp as well as the players haven't covered themselves in glory. We've got a lot wrong, not everything has to be a conspiracy pal.",Liverpool,Yes,jf20uey,t1_jf1x8zm
"Well look at the time line of when Ben Davies and Arthur Melo were signed. Look at the sequence.

Just before the window closes, injuries are piling up, Klopp complains and wants transfers they give him Ben Davies and Melo. 

Both go on to not play one 90 mins of game and people are telling me Klopp signed on this?

Yeah right and Santa claus is real. People have no understanding of sports psychology and keeping a united front. 

Will it take Klopp to do a Conte for people to open their eyes at the problem at the club?",Liverpool,Yes,jf1da21,t1_jf1cwtg

"I think going into next season we'll need reinforcements but more importantly a system change out of possession as well because of Van Dijk's downturn in pace.

Our high line used to work well because Virgil had absolute control on two key possibilities while defending:

1) He would keep the backline high enough to create multiple offside traps (Look at his last few seasons with us and the no. of offside calls in our favor)

2) If forwards timed their run perfectly and got behind the defence, Virgil had more than enough recovery pace and strength to nullify the attack.

Looking at his performance this season, Virgil seems to have the strength but not the speed required to pull of this tactic now. This is resulting in situations where we have a highline which gets cut past easily.

Obviously, getting a more competent CDM and CM will help in this case, but Virgil is still the one incharge of the backline and we have to figure out how to play best with his current strengths.",Liverpool,No,jew82gn,t3_12b9hgt

"Lately i've been wondering about the possibility of Jota walking in the summer. 

It makes sense to be honest. In spite of injuries (and Gakpo being a good player) we hardly needed another forward when we had such problems elsewhere, and considering all these reports of Bellingham and Mount you'd expect some big sales to balance the books - where do those come from? We hardly have a lot of valuable assets that we'd be willing to part with, but i'd count Jota among those.

"How many midfielders do people think we actually *need* for next season? Ox and Naby are off, Milner may or may not get renewed but will barely play, TBC on whether Fabinho and Henderson get moved on, Jones needs a loan imo. That leaves an ageing and injury prone Thiago, and then youngsters Bajcetic and Elliott. We definitely need a minimum of 3 starters, and I reckon a 4th dependent on whether Fab/Hendo get moved on.

Would ideally like two CB's and to move on Gomez and Matip, but that seems like too much of an overhaul compared to what we usually do in a summer. Wouldn't mind some competition for Trent that actually exists (Ramsey who?) and Robbo will be 30 next year so think we need to consider getting someone in with more quality that Tsimikas to eventually replace him.

I‚Äôm not sure about how this three together will work, since Jude and Mount are playing the same role (attacking mind b2b) and Caicedo more suited for Gini successors than no.6

"As much as we need midfielders, I feel that we need a big tactical overhaul in our build up play. Teams are finding it so easy to force turnovers against us with a simple middle block and pressing triggers on our midfield when they receive the ball. You see teams like City and Arsenal play out of presses with triangles and quick one touch football while we pass the ball between our defenders and follow up with booting the ball forward.

This goes beyond tired legs or physicality of our midfield and just highlights how lacking we are tactically when not playing against a team deploying a high pressing game that allows our midfield and forwards space to collect the ball.",Liverpool,No,jex6xms,t3_12b9hgt

"I'm normally a pessimist but I have a good feeling about the summer window.

I don't know if we get Bellingham but I do think there will be heavy investment into the midfield. This window will be nothing like anything before under Klopp/FSG. Poor form this season, numerous 'big' players leaving for free freeing up numbers in the squad and a lot of the wage bill.

If FSG don't invest heavily, it'll be the end of us being a successful team under them and Klopp. They know that, and investing this summer will 100% benefit them more in the long run.",Liverpool,Yes,jexat22,t1_jex1p16

I said lower down the thread that Jota is a possibility as well and i've gotten flamed, but i don't think it's that unrealistic either. I simply expect FSG to need a good amount from sales in order to fund the window that this team needs, and those players i mentioned won't get them anywhere near that.

"I agree, I think he's done for us. One of Fab's biggest weaknesses has always been that he takes a good couple of games to get up with the speed of the game after an injury lay-off.

"Fully agreed, there are many examples of players being run into the ground but i wouldn't classify Fabinho as one - which is why his decline is so mind boggling, expected him to have at least 4 more years at the top level.

"I actually think less rest might be the best course of action in his case.

"Has he really lost that much pace? enough to write him off in a high line system? 

I'd point more towards the fact that the midfield, and to an extent the attack, has consistently underperformed in it's role out of possession. High line defenses are incredibly reliant on a midfield who prevents the most dangerous ball, limiting to one/two instances a game, which we can afford because of Alisson's 1v1 ability. At the moment we're conceding multiple chances this way and a simple numbers game tells us it's going to result in conceding.",Liverpool,Yes,jew8io7,t1_jew82gn

Us letting players see out there contract is a problem for a team that doesn't spend big money. Been saying it for years.

I don't think letting Gini go was the problem, not replacing him with a similar player was a huge problem though. Because our midfield has been so bad the last couple of years it's easy to look back with nostalgia and miss him. But there was plenty of times he was poor. He, like most of our mids, are good when we are on top, scoring goals and controlling games but relatively poor and anonymous when we aren't.

I don't think the deal can be done earlier in the window it is going to be dragged out. I would rather us get Rice as we need a CDM right now or alternative.",Liverpool,Yes,jew7mp1,t1_jew6ox7
I'm hoping it's a case of he just wants out of Chelsea and and is asking for big money to stay just in case he actually gets it. But if we offer him over 140k imo we've lost the plot.,Liverpool,Yes,jewmsh1,t1_jew6ox7
Would still be shit. It just shows that they won't spend unless we are in total collapse which shouldn't be praised.,Liverpool,Yes,jevyc86,t1_jevuupk
"They are decent, solid, responsible owners. Off the field they've done wonders growing the club. On the field they quickly realised they had no idea what they were doing and appointed the best people to sort it. With a little more luck we could have had 3 premier leagues and 3 champions leagues over their tenure. We would struggle to top that at any period in our history.

On the downside, they are very, very, very risk averse. Whilst I do appreciate that, and certainly from their perspective, it doesn't seem to have been completely the right approach. If they invest heavily this summer, then that concern is reduced.",Liverpool,Yes,jew67zj,t1_jevuupk
"They've proven Red Sox fans right to be honest even if they do spend big this summer. When we were all happy about them getting VVD/Ali etc they warned us they won't invest big again until it all goes to shit.

They must learn from their mistakes this time and be proactive instead of reactive with spending money.",Liverpool,Yes,jewct0r,t1_jevuupk
They're utterly shite. Instead of spending proactively and challenging again this year or winning more last year they let us fall apart and once more show they are only interested in spending when the lack of it is hurting their assests value.,Liverpool,Yes,jewmn7c,t1_jevuupk
"Even if we get 5 marquees this summer they've fallen in my estimations more and more with each year, and i have little doubt that when Klopp leaves we'll not be challenging for much. 

They simply aren't ambitious enough in my view. Clubs our size don't settle for being a top 4 side like FSG do and that's a fact.",Liverpool,Yes,jevy3bn,t1_jevuupk
Define a near perfect window.,Liverpool,Yes,jevzeid,t1_jevuupk
"I know it's weird, one player you don't want to drop at this stage is salah. Maybe he has too many games but it still doesn't make sense to give him rest before a crucial tie we need to win.

Leicester: Maddison, Tielemans, Barnes, Castange

Leeds: Aaronson

Bournemouth: Billing 

Forest: Gibbs-White 

Everton: Branthwaite

Would be too forward thinking for us I think. I'm also not sure we can afford to be signing a player who doesn't fit what we need but are good value at the moment either.,Liverpool,Yes,jewb8qo,t1_jew870i

I don‚Äôt however think it is optimal timing with Bobby also going this Summer.
I think if we don‚Äôt have too many injuries next season it might be Jota‚Äôs last. 

I do think the logic is odd. We sign Gakpo so we can sell Jota, so we can buy Mount? 

But yeah I do agree that in the bigger picture sacrificing depth in attack to gain one or two starters for midfield. If put that way it is a no brainer.",Liverpool,Yes,jew51h1,t1_jevyxyd
"Honestly lad I agree. He‚Äôs a form player and when he‚Äôs firing he‚Äôs a sight to behold. Unfortunately, as I feel the case has been with Ox and even possibly VVD, his latest I jury seems to have really affected him. 30 games without scoring is quite damning. I‚Äôd love it if we could go and get someone like Lindstr√∏m from Frankfurt and if we could bin the idea that Elliot can play as a midfielder. 

If we can get a serious chunk of cash for him I‚Äôd let him walk. I love him as a player and want him to stick around but we need to start being ruthless. To me it feels as though recently he‚Äôs either playing his way back from injury, out injured, or coming off the bench which unfortunately is not what I‚Äôm looking for out of one of our core forwards.",Liverpool,Yes,jewbxoy,t1_jevyxyd

"No I agree.

Before we got Gakpo I was actually fairly happy with our front line as there were 4 solid players (yes 2 were injured but oh well) that were there for the future and Carvalho, also Doak and Cannonier are coming through the ranks

Now we have Gakpo we have 5-6 forwards for next year, 5 of which would start in other teams. Jota hasn't been the same since his first season so it makes sense to let him go.",Liverpool,Yes,jew3zhy,t1_jevyxyd

Because we have no other options,Liverpool,Yes,jey32kk,t1_jey2qqf

"No way hendo and fabi get moved on, just don‚Äôt see it happening.",Liverpool,Yes,jewtrv1,t1_jewihe4
"I think at minimum we need two signings. Three if we move on Hendo or Fab, although I don't think we will do either. 

Need a starting RCM and an LCM who can push/rotate with Thiago, ultimately succeeding him as the starter. Then you're relying on Baj to rotate with Fab until he eventually succeeds Fab. 

Then after those five players (let's say for the sake of argument: Bellingham, Mount, Fab, Baj, Thiago), you've got Hendo, Elliott, Morton, and Jones as depth options while looking to get Carvalho and Kaide Gordon minutes in cup matches if we don't send them on loan. 

Ideally, we'd want to also sign a starting quality DM and maybe move Fab on, but if it's between that and getting in another quality CB, I'd rather have the CB.",Liverpool,Yes,jexvq4s,t1_jewihe4

They aren't bringing in multiple 100m players.",Liverpool,Yes,jexbt99,t1_jex8grr
Caicedo is an alternate to Jude. We don‚Äôt need both. We need an actual cdm rather than trying to fit Caicedo there,Liverpool,Yes,jexw9aq,t1_jex8grr

"Guess it's more of having the type of players who offer more press resistance than what we have. Gini, an on-form Fab and Thiago can carry the ball and find space whilst under pressure.

You can't do a tactical overhaul if you don't rate technical players or know how to coach build up. Our buildup before was just either TTA and VVD picking out a great pass or Matip running from deep.,Liverpool,Yes,jexmphh,t1_jex6xms
"McAllister would probably go for around 70-80m, Mount for around 40-50m so he‚Äôs much cheaper. Also, Mount is nothing like Carvalho. Mount is a midfielder whereas Carvalho is more of an attacking midfielder. Mount is much better defensively and has a much better work rate. If anything I think Mount could be that Gini type player or a similar player player to Lallana",Liverpool,Yes,jexvcfj,t1_jext2qq
He‚Äôs not on thin ice unless we get relegated mate,Liverpool,Yes,jey099d,t1_jexzyhl

"If they don‚Äôt invest that much this summer then we won‚Äôt be getting top 4 for a while. It‚Äôs not a matter of FSG wanting to invest a lot this summer, they HAVE to invest a lot this summer if they want to run a successful business.

"Has to be an attitude problem or some sort. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason for him to not feature at all now that we‚Äôve been playing with a 10, whilst Klopp subs on the likes of Milner and Ox when we need goals and Carvalho is literally there.",Liverpool,Yes,jexfeh4,t1_jexcb0y
"Getting downvoted but you're probably right, plus Bajcetic breaking through makes it unlikely we sign 3 midfielders tbf. But then again we are losing Naby/Ox/Arthur so that frees up space

"Yeah same. All I ever wanted growing up was for Liverpool to be competitive. I remember really enjoying 08-09 because we were in a title race. It was amazing. Yeah we didn't win, but we played great football.

We had the odd cup, but it was sparse.

Under Klopp, won everything, lost a few finals but we had to fun of getting to the finals, title races most years, won one.

Yeah, butterfly effect and all that, we could have won ridiculous amounts of trophies. But can't not be grateful for what we have won, mainly breaking the PL hoodoo.",Liverpool,Yes,jew522i,t1_jew4f02
"What a kid. Can't believe he's only 20.

On a side note, I hope he calls his house the HElliPad.",Liverpool,Yes,jew4ddy,t1_jew48fe
He said Jude has informed the club before the weekend (this or last weekend) that he wants to join us. And that FSG is looking to give Klopp significant funding. And Nunes from Wolves is not happening and they are looking at other targets instead,Liverpool,Yes,jevzwns,t1_jevwsm9
"I may well get downvoted for this too, but the whole Jota thing is the perfect example of what's wrong with modern football fans tbh.

We've had years of people saying that Klopp is too loyal, we need to sell players before they fall off, letting players go on a free is bad etc. - but as soon as there's talk of someone possibly getting sold, there's an outcry from fans that we shouldn't sell him.

The problem is that we like the lads who play for us, so we don't want to see them go - but when it reaches the point where we no longer like them and want them to go, their stock has fallen, they're past their best and nobody wants them enough to pay decent money.

When people are talking about us being more ruthless with the squad, _selling Jota would be exactly that_.

I really like Jota and would love him to stay, but he hasn't scored in a year. Obviously injuries are a part of that, but then we've also had people complaining that we keep players who are constantly injured.",Liverpool,Yes,jewconl,t1_jew7cj7
"Selling Fabinho would be madness IMO. He's suffering as a result of monumental workload. Bring in reinforcements, give him decent rest/rotation and I bet we'd start to see him back towards his best.",Liverpool,Yes,jew8ny4,t1_jew7cj7
"I don't see us selling Fabinho or Matip. Selling them would also do us no good, they won't be valued properly at the moment because of their form. They are both quality assets, despite the (huge) drop in form. 

Fabinho has shown glimpses of his quality and I do think he just needs a proper rest. 

Matip won't leave if Rhys is out on loan again and Phillips leaves, we need him for cover at cb. 

Selling Jota would be an absolute mistake imo. I don't know why he is suddenly a topic in the community. He has only played a few games this season.",Liverpool,Yes,jew9kx6,t1_jew7cj7
He moves like he's 40. You don't just recover from that.,Liverpool,Yes,jewmcva,t1_jewbvsu
"This is the answer. Also, missing games through injury and being played as soon as you're fit is not a rest",Liverpool,Yes,jewlw8g,t1_jewj32n

"Especially when Man City had a clone in Fernandinho playing at the top level until he was about 54. Part of me thinks is he just suffering from not being next to players with enough legs, but he's making basic mistakes every game.",Liverpool,Yes,jewfz9z,t1_jewe11d
His massive decline genuinely makes me question if he is actually 29.,Liverpool,Yes,jewmi9g,t1_jewe11d

"I do think so, VVD in his prime was an absolute cheat-code, there was no getting past him. (For e.g. That 2v1 counter against Spurs, probably the worst situation for a defender to be in, and he'd still manage to cut out the attack) 

Now, you can start seeing some cracks in his armor. His football IQ and physicality are still amazing, but his recovery pace has definitely taken a hit to affect our high line significantly. 

I agree that Fabinho has a major role to play here, he'd cut out most counters before they had the chance to turn into something dangerous, but I think there could be a case of the defence still being slightly leaky if VVD's form regresses further despite getting midfield reinforcements. 

Also, the reason we were so successful last year is because we were playing with a super high line in most matches with our defence staying in the opponent's half for most games. This system was extremely high risk but it helped us choke opponents in their own half and also gave us the advantage of letting Trent stay high up the pitch and try creating chances on the right flank. That worked well for us, but I'm not sure if it'll work again come next season.",Liverpool,Yes,jew99hk,t1_jew8io7
"No of course virg hasn‚Äôt lost that much pace. His sprints are still fast enough. Offsides trap also has slightly less to do with pace and more about defensive coordination, organization and timing, and I feel like virg has just lapsed some focus in recent months. 

Look at chiellini and bonucci, they were slow as dirt but used to run brilliant traps. Or Thiago Silva whose lost a yard or two of his pace but at 38 has made up for it by being the smartest defender out there. 

Midfield being waltzed thru doesn‚Äôt help either, when an attack has the entire pitch and minutes to pick a pass, then yea easy to find space behind the backline",Liverpool,Yes,jewxcgj,t1_jew8io7

"I think you have to go and improve other areas of the team. A direct replacement is impossible. It would be hard to see him go but 120m for his age is a great fee.

Fergie let some big players go in his time aswell.",Liverpool,Yes,jew806e,t1_jew6bdp
"Tbh I'd take it and reinvest in more urgent areas - ¬£100m plus his saved wages would be a significant amount if put straight into the transfer kitty.

If we continue with 3 up top then we have Dias, Darwin, Jota, Gakpo, Elliott, Carvalho, Doak to pick from. Gakpo, Elliott or Dias (think he can play on right too?) can start there.

Would like another forward but we have bigger fires in midfield and defence to put out first, even if we sold Mo.",Liverpool,Yes,jewu9uz,t1_jew6bdp
"Yea the other part of the equation is that ox and Naby likely knew they were getting a better deal anywhere else, so stuck around. Gini was tough bc had we just increased our offer to 3 years he would have stayed but then bc we ducked around, psg swooped in and gave him stupid wages.",Liverpool,Yes,jewudq6,t1_jewrnmq
"You can't call Gini injury prone, for us he played 35+ games a season every year he was here , he had one freak injury at Roma that's it.

Keita can barely play 5 games in a row",Liverpool,Yes,jexnxas,t1_jewrnmq
We sold Mane remember,Liverpool,Yes,jewz2yp,t1_jewyba0
I think we could have sold Keita last summer. We‚Äôd kept the injuries at bay for most of the year and he had a pretty good year. Would have got at least a decent chunk of it back and enough to get a pair of legs running around this season.,Liverpool,Yes,jewz7do,t1_jewvgwo
"No, it's extremely irresponsible to have thrown away a chance of dominance when we were on top to now be getting battered every other week and struggling for any European spot at all. 

¬£20-40m more on incomings each year while getting rid of players at the right time and recouping money would have been responsible. As of now, we've seen important players leave for free and now need to spend more money in a shorter time frame than we would've spent while on top. Add to that every single team around us has improved and shown ambition, while we've fallen too far behind. 

There's no way to dress up throwing away entire seasons of the best team we've had in decades as ""responsible""",Liverpool,Yes,jextueq,t1_jexoku6

Ox vs Arsenal at Anfield last season. One of his best performances in recent times before he was an emergency forward,Liverpool,Yes,jewbej0,t1_jew5sp1
Walker-Peters and Bella-Kotchap would be solid additions. Anywhere around ¬£40m for the pair would be decent business.,Liverpool,Yes,jews9k1,t1_jew9uqm
"Barnes could be an inspired signing if they go down. Would give us something very different. 

Caleta car is someone we almost signed a few seasons back, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see us go back. Know folks like Bella kotchap too, I can‚Äôt profess to have watched him enough to know whose better. 

Aaronson maybe could be a good fit, Adams also would be slightly interesting but not my first choice. Gnonto would be very interesting for me. 

Billing from Bournemouth is a good shout. Outtara could be interesting, though he‚Äôd be better for a side that would be able to counter more‚Ä¶but boy is he rapid. 

Forest I have to agree, Gibbs white is the one. Im also a fan of Brennan Johnson, but not sure he‚Äôs quite good enough for a side trying to challenge for all honors. 

Everton - no one‚Ä¶all jokes aside Braithwaite looks a talent. That Onana lad also has been decent in what is a truly shite side. 

Barnes for me is the crown jewel. If he becomes available for a reasonable price, I‚Äôd be all over that. Especially since there have been links in the past",Liverpool,Yes,jewwy5x,t1_jew9uqm

"Why do you feel the need to be so abusive? Jesus people are allowed to have different opinions to your own. Jota isn‚Äôt that great and doesn‚Äôt offer much different to our other attackers in addition to likely being near his ceiling.

Attack the argument not the person.,Liverpool,Yes,jew21fa,t1_jew0jpq
"Because we need to replace our entire midfield and have owners who won't invest 300 million to fix it.

So a 5th choice forward who has had some injury problems along with form issues leading to a total  0 goals in 12 months is a luxury we can't afford.

Spend that 50m on a starting quality midfielder and we will be a much better team for it.

No sane team sorts out there depth first before they even have a functioning starting 11. You sort your depth last.",Liverpool,Yes,jew5jk8,t1_jew0jpq
"Cause this is what we do as a club under FSG. We sell depth in one position to fund upgrades in another and pray we don't fall apart to injuries. Only thats happened twice now in three years.

"Definitely not both, but I think we could see one of them getting moved on, in which case I think we‚Äôd need to get another #6 in",Liverpool,Yes,jewu3bt,t1_jewtrv1
And yet this has remained a problem that hasn‚Äôt been addressed for so long now. On paper our midfielders should be able to do this with no problem and yet week in week out it‚Äôs pass to the defence to hoof it forward.,Liverpool,Yes,jexfqtz,t1_jexa795
"Shock horror, Klopp does the exact same thing as we‚Äôve said once again and it doesn‚Äôt work. Get one or two midfielders isn‚Äôt going to change the way we play without Klopp realising that you can play the ball down the middle and not just the touch line.",Liverpool,Yes,jeyvhla,t1_jexmphh

"With many of us he is, this is of his own making after constantly wanting a small squad the last few years. That midfield is actually the worst ive seen in ages",Liverpool,Yes,jey08c0,t1_jey021a
"Thiago, Hendo and Fab are all getting on, though. Aren't they?

You even have people saying Fabinho needs to be sold lol",Liverpool,Yes,jexww5o,t1_jexc9f6

Bellingham is not kante. Kante in his prime was alone a 3 man midfield üòÖ,Liverpool,Yes,jex4g42,t1_jew5x47
"Don't understand. He has a differentiation factor, Coutinho esque (early days). I dont really understand why elliot starts over him.",Liverpool,Yes,jexij5j,t1_jexfeh4
"He's also very young, probably a good idea to avoid young players being subjected to this shitshow at the moment. Same with Jones",Liverpool,Yes,jexibp2,t1_jexfeh4
"I'm not so sure, I think if they both play half the minutes then they'll both play better. Henderson I think is definitely on the way down due to his age but Fabinho I wouldn't give up on yet even if he has been really shit this season, I don't think it's inconceivable that he turns it around next season. There's also Bajcetic who can help out too

I think buying a whole new starting midfield 3 is unrealistic, Mount and Bellingham will be the best part of 200m probably but they'd go a long way to improving us.",Liverpool,Yes,jews9kf,t1_jews1ks
"Think Morton is an absolute sleeper. Klopp regarded him incredibly highly, he‚Äôs gotten significant minutes. 

Jones may end up going and replaced by morton.",Liverpool,Yes,jewuw5x,t1_jewru61
Exactly. Too many people focus on the end. For me the fun part of football is the journey. Every top season we‚Äôve had where we‚Äôve missed out in a final or by 1 point. That sucks but man were they enjoyable,Liverpool,Yes,jew9nw5,t1_jew522i
"> He said Jude has informed the club before the weekend (this or last weekend) that he wants to join us

I saw that he said Bellingham is keen to move to Anfield, but didn't know he'd said Bellingham specifically told the club he wanted to join us, was that in the same article?",Liverpool,Yes,jew38s2,t1_jevzwns
"There is going to be significant funding. I am positive of this.

Its because I was in the FSG boat. Even in the summer, I thought we'd be okay without another midfielder. I really wanted one in, but its the same squad that almost won 4 trophies. Obviously I was wrong and I think its glaring that we need players. 

I'd heavily invest now, and I think FSG sees that too. 

But the think is, if we get Jude, we probably only get one more midfielder. I really wanted 3. Maybe we do Jude/Mount and a Gary McAllister kind of a signing.",Liverpool,Yes,jew4qv4,t1_jevzwns
"He‚Äôll be 30 at the start of next season.

Typically players don‚Äôt ‚Äúrediscover their form‚Äù at that age. They decline.",Liverpool,Yes,jewcp55,t1_jew8ny4
"> He's suffering as a result of monumental workload.

He's never started more than about 25 PL games for us in a season has he? He's suffering from being washed imo",Liverpool,Yes,jewazg1,t1_jew8ny4
"Precisely, when the legs go there is no coming back from that especially when being asked to play in a pressing system in a high paced midfield.",Liverpool,Yes,jewor86,t1_jewmcva
"And it's important to realise that all minutes aren't the same. 

Teams like Madrid, Bayern or city have deeper squads with better rotation. They also have so many games where they're 3 or 4 up by half time and the game is killed off, reduced to controlled strolling around. In comparison, we're almost always frantically fighting tooth and nail to the final whistle with all those tight 2-1 games because we're not clinical enough to kill off games while opponents only need a single chance to score against us. 

2000 minutes of calmly controlling a dead game is nowhere near 1500 minutes of non-stop running and covering for 2 players around you, despite looking much worse when simplistically looked at as flat numbers",Liverpool,Yes,jexb3rj,t1_jewu1rh
"But that was more to do with his IQ rather than his pace, IMO. Lots of fast defenders would've bollocks that up royally. 

I agree he's probably declining in terms of his normal pace but I don't think it's to the extent that requires a system overhaul. I especially think this decline will be slowed by recreating a high functioning midfield in front of him. I'd also mention that a developing Konate is probably the best like for like player to do what Van Dijk always did so successfully. 

Only time will tell but the bones of the squad are built for that kind of system. It's about signing and coaching correctly , everything we've done since Klopp came in has been about creating this system and a complete overhaul would be seriously risky IMO.",Liverpool,Yes,jewaqem,t1_jew99hk
This. There is no replacing Salah. Take the money and invest it elsewhere in the squad and put one of our current forwards on the right and pray that Darwin and Diaz can make up enough of the production.,Liverpool,Yes,jexxt7b,t1_jewu9uz
"true, the more you think this out the less sense it makes. even if we could find someone to offload naby to, we would probably have to still pay a decent portion of his wages. then the problem is paying for a replacement when it was clear we didn't like any of the available midfielders at the time.",Liverpool,Yes,jewv9mq,t1_jewudq6
"Yes I do, but Klopp absolutely wanted him to stay, and had Bayern not made their interest known, Sadio would enter the same situation so many other Klopp players have in their last 12 months at the club.",Liverpool,Yes,jex08r3,t1_jewz2yp
Yeh there'd have been a few times we could have sold him. Another team would have took a punt on him at ¬£20-¬£30m easily. I guarantee he goes to a top club when he leaves so it shows as bad as he's been for us teams will still take him.,Liverpool,Yes,jex5skm,t1_jewz7do
Irresponsible doesn‚Äôt seem quite the right word here,Liverpool,Yes,jexy6w2,t1_jextueq
"You'll be fine, no names or anything get checked.",Liverpool,Yes,jexfmht,t1_jexabvs
Yes basically. It's a really quick process wonder up buzz your phone on a contactless pad and you're in. Don't even speak to a human. They've got to get a lot of people in in a short period of time,Liverpool,Yes,jexofjy,t1_jexabvs
I think it‚Äôs definately length of contract and worries about playing time and where he seen moving forward. Also probably the fact the perpetual manager roundabout and lack of stability is worrying at this point in his career,Liverpool,Yes,jew891e,t1_jew7bie
We don't need an RB though,Liverpool,Yes,jew41zj,t1_jew00dr
I'll add a gk in case Kellerher leaves to the list. That's a good number but depends on the players and their profile. If possible add a cheap rw option to the list. Someone young and who wouldn't mind being a salah understudy on the bench.,Liverpool,Yes,jew0625,t1_jew00dr
Looking through your comment history I have to say you of all people are the last person who‚Äôs opinion I‚Äôll take,Liverpool,Yes,jf1uezz,t1_jf11elw
"Fuck off you boring little scrote.

You couldn‚Äôt point Liverpool out on a map.",Liverpool,Yes,jey42yd,t1_jey3yen
UNLOCK THE BASEMENT!,Liverpool,Yes,jew2nrf,t1_jevzylh
"Sillier things have been known to happen. None of the players you named are not nearly good enough to play in Jota's role. With how many games Liverpool play a season, we have to rotate and Jota will be extremely useful when that happens. I didn't say all our forwards will be injured at the same time, but then again Ox was playing LW at one point this season.",Liverpool,Yes,jewwquv,t1_jew0auh
"These people aren't talking about Jota being replaced though, our fans want Jota sold to use the money into the midfield. 

If you think losing Jota and Firmino and leaving us with 4 capable forwards is a good thing, you are an idiot it's simple as that haha.

Also Gnonto would cost silly money and would be a total different argument to what the original comment is saying.",Liverpool,Yes,jew7jq9,t1_jew70mr
Cant attack with our midfielders,Liverpool,Yes,jew2jva,t1_jew21fa
Cumblast is shooting blanks now a days.,Liverpool,Yes,jew3edl,t1_jew21fa
"What about his 30 G/A last season? This season granted he isn't in great form but most of that is down to no pre season, injuries and no actual run in the team in his preferred position. 

Also lets not forget Firmino is leaving as well. So between him and Jota this season even with them being out of favour and both missing a lot of games through injury they have played a combined 47 games with 22 G/A and we are only 3/4 into the season. If you think letting them 2 go without replacing and leaving us with 4 capable attackers  will work out well you are deluded. 

We obviously need serious investment in the midfield. But butchering other areas of the pitch to do that won't pay off whatsoever. It will just cause us more problems. The owners simply need to put money into the club. If our only chance of signings is gonna be from selling players we are fucked regardless.",Liverpool,Yes,jew84za,t1_jew5jk8
">Jota is the only player we have that has any decent value and is somewhat expendable

But he isn't expendable though, that's the whole point. He has had 2 bad injuries this season and still played 17 games. We are also losing Firmino who despite being 6th choice and having his only injury problems this season has played 30 games. We are only 3/4 through the season as well and didn't have no decent cup runs. Who's playing them 47+ games next season?

If we go into next season with 4 attackers our season will be over quicker than it was this season I guarantee it. The whole reason we competed in all 4 last season was because we signed Diaz in Jan and it meant we had Diaz, Salah, Mane, Firmino, Jota, Origi, Minamino. 7 attackers that all played decent minutes and all chipped in in their own way. That allowed us to challenge.

by losing Origi, Minamino and Mane and just bringing in Nunez it means we've been short upfront multiple times this season meaning we've played the likes of OX there multiple times. 

If we think the answer to that is letting 2 more forwards go we are fucked.

I know exactly what FSG are like but this is do or die for us. We have decent defensive and attacking depth but the midfield is a shambles. Invest heavily this summer and we will be back competing for everything next season. If we are butchering one part of our squad to improve other areas this era is fucked and there will be no more success under FSG or Klopp. 

This window is like no other under Klopp or FSG and because of that I think they know they need to spend big money. It's also so different that it can't be compared to previous windows. 

We will obviously have to wait and see but I guarantee it and would bet any money that if we have to sell the likes of Jota to buy a midfielder it won't end well.",Liverpool,Yes,jewstiy,t1_jewn0x3
"I genuinely don't know how people think going into a season with 4 Attackers would be a good thing. 

Them 2 have missed 35 games between them this season, yet still played a combined 47 games with 22 G/A in a season where they've both had poor runs of form and injury problems. And even with them playing 47 games we've still had Ox playing on the wing and been short up top at times.",Liverpool,Yes,jew8tja,t1_jew3ilv
"Can't believe you are getting downvoted for that, this sub is an embarrassment.",Liverpool,Yes,jew5un5,t1_jew40wa
Would absolutely love Gnonto if Leeds go down. He‚Äôs like the perfect Klopp player imo.,Liverpool,Yes,jew6swm,t1_jew4jew
"you've got it backwards, american franchises are significantly more profitable and don't run the risk of relegation. an NFL team makes 3-4x more from the TV deal than an EPL team. also salary caps limit spending on players.

LFC literally turned a profit of ¬£7m last year, one of the only teams in the league to even be out of the red.",Liverpool,Yes,jexzh10,t1_jexyvf6
You have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about. American sports teams generate ungodly amounts of money especially in the nfl,Liverpool,Yes,jexztvd,t1_jexyvf6
"Agree, every responsible party needs to be held accountable. Just feel it lies more with FSG. 

When Bajcetic was available, you could see he could handle receiving and carrying the ball forward as well, all under pressure. Elliot not so much but apparently attempts to press more than anyone else in the team. Doesn't mean he's shite, just a different player.. and we need these different skills in the team.

Jones, on the other hand, I'm not too sure what's his best attribute. I'd put him alongside Ox. The system evolved in such a way that they are more likely to be exposed in the centre of the pitch and thus, are played on the wings or further forward.",Liverpool,Yes,jexr6il,t1_jexfqtz
Those fans are the small minority online. In real life everyone fully backs him. Ask any match-going fan and they‚Äôd tell you that they‚Äôd never want Klopp to leave,Liverpool,Yes,jey0nli,t1_jey0h3m
"Not really, everyone has accepted this season is done, a miracle will be needed for Top 4 and want him to be the one who does the rebuild. Also, if you are talking about twitter fans being upset, they get upset at the most minor things, so doesn‚Äôt really matter.",Liverpool,Yes,jey0u4i,t1_jey0h3m
Many of you...ha. loud minority of idiots,Liverpool,Yes,jey4306,t1_jey08c0
"If he wanted to replace as well, who is giving him the money? Do you think he willingly wanted to keep Naby and Ox? Both of them have been on the market for 3 summers and nobody has even made a bid for them.",Liverpool,Yes,jey14mj,t1_jey08c0
"Doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt play some sort of a role next season. If we buy who you say we should buy then we‚Äôd be left with: Jude, Mount, DM 1, DM 2, Hendo, Thiago, Fab, Jones, Elliot, Bjacetic. That‚Äôs 10 midfielders for 3 spots, we don‚Äôt need that many at all. Thiago is still as good as ever but he shouldn‚Äôt be having to play every game, Hendo and Fab should take up rotational roles. Our starting midfield should be a new DM, Jude, Thiago/Mount with Fab, Hendo, Elliot, Bjacetic and Jones rotating",Liverpool,Yes,jexzj7k,t1_jexww5o
Can't wait for rival fans to start their Mickey Mount and Bellendham agendas.,Liverpool,Yes,jew5vjn,t1_jew5prr
"Fab has been ran into the ground

Money Mase hasn‚Äôt",Liverpool,Yes,jew5obp,t1_jew5ml9
"Hence why I said ‚Äòespecially one that young‚Äô. Fab has played a lot of football in his career so it‚Äôs not that surprising that he‚Äôs burnt out this early, Mount is still young so there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs already ‚Äòfinished‚Äô",Liverpool,Yes,jew5sh6,t1_jew5ml9
"Lmao Arthur isn't even a footballer at this point, people have lost the plot",Liverpool,Yes,jey4c7j,t1_jey38lq
I think in hindsight Leicester would rather have sold Mahrez and Vardy if they could keep Kante.,Liverpool,Yes,jexftb2,t1_jex4g42
It‚Äôs because Elliott can play ‚Äúdeeper‚Äù than him. The biggest question is why can‚Äôt he even get a sniff of the pitch when we‚Äôve been deploying a 10 and also being in a goal ‚Äúdraught‚Äù,Liverpool,Yes,jexk5j9,t1_jexij5j
Having young players not play at all is far more harmful to their development.,Liverpool,Yes,jexjsb7,t1_jexibp2
No play time whatsoever is what prevents player development. If anything this should be the time to play him when most of the squad are playing shit. Under the elite managers so many of our starters would‚Äôve been benched by now from how they‚Äôve been playing,Liverpool,Yes,jexkeoo,t1_jexibp2
"We need to move away from referring to Jones as a young player. At 22 and given how long he's been in the squad he can't possibly be classed the same as Elliott, Carvalho, Ramsey etc",Liverpool,Yes,jexmb9a,t1_jexibp2
"I don‚Äôt disagree with you for the most part. It seems nearly impossible we let the skipper go this summer, with only a slightly bigger chance Fab goes, but I find it hard to believe the club will sell, they‚Äôll give him one more chance. 

Bajcetic also will likely take increased minutes",Liverpool,Yes,jewusm2,t1_jews9kf
"Cant exactly remember how he wrote it but ""eager to join"" might be  better way to put it than my original post",Liverpool,Yes,jew3fvh,t1_jew38s2
"But that could be down to the intensity of minutes. At the beginning of last season, aged 28, he‚Äôd played the same amount as the average 35 year old in the PL. 

Washed is a massively reactionary statement imo.",Liverpool,Yes,jewfjpk,t1_jewazg1
"Despite this stat, he starts every cl match, many cup matches‚Ä¶there was a great graphic the other day showing how he‚Äôs played more minutes than any other 29 year old in recent years.",Liverpool,Yes,jewxyah,t1_jewazg1
"I'm hoping you're right here, I would love to see us play and succeed with a super highline just like previous seasons.

I guess the next season will then be another trial by fire for our backline, if we get sufficient reinforcements in midfield, there are no excuses for any lapses in our defence highline or not and that'll answer our questions.",Liverpool,Yes,jewbj7r,t1_jewaqem
I think he would have had a renewal to be honest. Don‚Äôt think he would have got the same money as Mo though so you never know.,Liverpool,Yes,jex0x78,t1_jex08r3

Suck my cock fella how many times you been yeah,Liverpool,Yes,jey4lke,t1_jey42yd
"Yes because we need to fund our massive overhaul of the midfield from somewhere? Or are you happy with Fab and Hendo lumbering about the pitch still next season? Jesus any comment that suggests one of our players might be dispensable is met with such horrible toxicity. 

Leeds are likely to go down, therefore Gnonto would be way cheaper but even so, he‚Äôs just an option. Jota isn‚Äôt that great and people are way too loyal to players that aren‚Äôt going to make a huge impact for us.",Liverpool,Yes,jew7qn3,t1_jew7jq9

"I would argue Elliot can't play that much deeper. I would like to see elliot further up the pitch, as he doesn't offer enough defensive qualities, espeicially infront of Trent which is a disaster for both of them. I always thought Carvalho is one of the youth players that has the ""It"" factor. Must be behavior issues like said above.",Liverpool,Yes,jexl5qf,t1_jexk5j9

"Looking at fbref, Trent has been our best defender not named Konate, and Konate has played far fewer games. He's definitely been scapegoated

"Jota is class he's just had a bad season for multiple reasons. No pre season, Injuries and no actual run in the team. 

Like I said previously people don't want Jota replaced which is my issue. We simply can't go into a season with 4 attackers as we'd end up with Tsmikas on the wing or something 2 months into the season and you'd all be crying on here how we need to sell midfielders to buy an attack.

We've got to the point where the owners simply have to invest. They've spent peanuts compared to the success we've have, now they have to stump up the money. We have 5 or 6 leaving for free, 4 of them are 'big' players. that'll free up 600k+ a week in wages, some fringe players will more than likely be sold. 

We haven't been in this scenario under Klopp with FSG before. Where it feels like FSG will be forced to spend. And that's the avenue we HAVE to go down.",Liverpool,Yes,jew8k2k,t1_jew7qn3

For me though I think the depth options are much better being ones with attributes our first team don‚Äôt have plus also ones with great potential to deputise for the first team in the future. Whilst Jota is a decent player, he isn‚Äôt either of the above and at his stage in his career probably deserves better than 5th choice.

That's true to an extent but we're talking about worldwide viewership compared to a market of 350m spread across 3/4 sports that are also domestic with little worldwide appeal,Liverpool,Yes,jey2s2u,t1_jey16b5
Top fan,Liverpool,Yes,jeyz1xz,t1_jeyp9t9
"See I understand that point, I personally wouldn't do that but I can understand why some would. But tbh Jota is on the verge of going a full season without scoring and having multiple lengthy injuries. How high is his price gonna be realistically? ¬£40m? That gets you an Antony Gordon haha. 

I'm a very pessimistic fan and I have no faith in FSG whatsoever but I just feel like this summer is so different to any summer we've had before and is by absolutely miles more important than any window of the Klopp era. We have the attack/Defence and Manager to be a top team and by investing properly in the midfield we can kick on again. But if it doesn't get rectified this summer, Klopp won't be here this time next year and this era will be over for good and that'll hurt FSG a lot more than spending ¬£200m+ this summer.

Just seen James Pearce say FSG are prepared to spend serious money this summer, IDK how true that is or what 'serious' money is like haha.",Liverpool,Yes,jewckvr,t1_jew9rsa
"Posting again since I put a lot of time into it. I keep seeing people saying Klopp is stubbornly wedded to 4-3-3 when the truth has been anything but. 

Klopp has been trying various things with our midfield, but it doesn't solve the fundamental problem that our midfield lacks energy. This season alone we've moved away from the single pivot on multiple occasions to a double pivot, a diamond midfield, a box midfield and a 4-4-2. We employed a box/double pivot set up yesterday and it was awful. 

we simply lacked the energy to compete, and obviously we weren't going to beat City's midfield on technique. Ultimately Fabinho and Henderson failed to cover their spaces properly, and Elliott/Gakpo were slow to their men multiple times. 

Let's take a look at some stills from the game. 

[3rd minute](https://imgur.com/a/FuGWxZA) Klopps reason for playing the box here is clear. City was playing a box too and this allowed us to press their 2 deep with 2 (Elliott and Gakpo), with Henderson and Fabinho distinctly sitting deep and parallel to each other, Jota and Salah pressing up top. 

[12 min](https://imgur.com/hG5lIVk) 
Another shape we employed was to have Salah and Gakpo sitting on their deep 2 instead, with Elliott and Jota forming a flatter back four. This we used when play progressed further. 

[20th minute](https://imgur.com/wn8KwTV)
Once again the double pivot is clear. Harvey Elliott and Jota are level. 

[In the build up to their 1st goal](https://imgur.com/7l5v1RH) Fabinho and Henderson are neither zonally blocking out their advanced 2 nor marking their deep 2. But clearly a double pivot/flat four from us here. 

[Crucial moment for the second goal](https://imgur.com/Wjl4Jkz). 

Fabinho was slow to close the tackle or get back to cover for Trent. This leaves our remaining back three to cover the width of the pitch as City play a pass. Henderson doesn't drop into the back four to help either. 

VVD Caught flat footed for the pass - a mistake which happens all the time but results in complete disaster here. Konate also too far covering for Trent to help. Robertson has too much space to cover and can't get there in time. 

[Third Goal](https://imgur.com/prBFg8n). If you can't see two banks of four in here you're lost honestly. 

Fabinho ball watching fails to pick up the deep run and leaves him free for a shot. Rebound falls to a City player for goal. 

[This 4th goal](https://imgur.com/xKRrXXF) is probably the worst one for me. 

We see here a nice 4-4-2 organized shape from us with Gakpo Left, Ox right and Nunez/Firmino up front, but for some reason [Gakpo leaves it to go press the City rb/rcb.] (https://imgur.com/6MCpeWR) Gundogan is in acres of space and neither our DMs nor our strikers are ready to press here. 

He turns and [plays a great pass.](https://imgur.com/lR1t238) 

Now when you see this you know something's already fucked. Trent is in a 2 on 1 vs Mahrez and Grealish and the back four is wrongly positioned. Probably squeezing that half of the pitch to press, but there was no press? 

The closest midfielders to help are Ox and Fabinho. Ox does not bust a run to get back. Fuck knows why. Fabinho is way too casual here or maybe he just can't run, he doesn't burst into full speed until it's way too late. 

Trent gets caught [flat footed on the two on one.](https://imgur.com/E8YubqA) It's not his fault. Ox is showing zero urgency at this point to help him out. Konate makes a heroic effort to close to distance. 

When the [goal happens](https://imgur.com/yjYLHDE), Konate somehow gets near the ball. Trent is sleeping and ball watching as Grealish scores. Ox has managed to fall behind Fabinho and has no idea what on earth is going on. Lost the entire play. 

Fabinho bursts into a late sprint and but way too late. 

Poor from Trent but our midfield failed to back him up in a 2 on 1, nor cover for Konate when Konate tried to compensate. Just absolute clownery. Just also realized the midfield also failed to cut out the pass nor pressure the man with the pass. Is it any wonder that even VVD is struggling here? 

But please don't fucking tell me Klopp and his 4-3-3 addiction. That's just fucking absurd. We're failing to press, and when we can't press the only other way is to sit and counter, which Klopp you could say is a bit of an idealist to not do against the likes of City, but you think West Ham/Everton are going to be 3 points if we're sitting deep and hitting them on the break?

Edit: Wanted this to be a more simple post but ended up taking a deeper look at the goals I guess. Our midfield just sold out our defense at so many points in the game it's upsetting. The Athletic article points out how City definitely made it difficult for our team with spare men, City's technical ability etc but skims over how poor our midfielders were. The gist of it is that they defeated our press with clever positioning (granted my understanding of pressing triggers and structures isn't the best) and played it out to Grealish/KDB who made it hard for Fabinho/Henderson to pick them up by positioning wider of the double pivot. 

What I do know is what goes next. Plugging gaps, covering spaces and the like. Fabinho and Henderson were unable to mark Grealish/KDB nor cut out passes to them nor did they contribute effectively to the press. They could have covered at RB/CB more often but were often slow to get back/recognize the danger. 

If a player gets beaten on the dribble, that happens all the time in football. Someone must be there to cover for him. If a player gets beaten 2v1, that's even worse, someone has already fucked up for it to get to that point. We saw that multiple times in the game yesterday and our midfield was pedestrian, I doubt Klopp was telling them to do that.

There's no way to make proactive football work without an energetic/overly technical midfield.

Either you have a team of slick passers who can dance around the opposing team like Xavi, Iniesta, Busquets or the Spain of the early 2000s, or you need to press. In the best case you have both but life doesn't always work that way. 

Giving up proactive football in favor of counter-attacking football isn't a great stopgap either. We will have to drill/change our tactics entirely mid-season and basically become Ole's United where we slay big teams and struggle to break down small teams even more as they will refuse to give us space anyway.",Liverpool,No,jer5nxd,t3_12aa0pz

I've always felt that no matter how the season plays out, if it was up to Jude, he'd want to come here. The leg work the club has done and the buy-in from Jude isn't just going to evaporate due to one one-off bad season that can easily be washed away with midfield-prioritized investment this summer. In the end, it'll be up to us to be able to make it happen, and honestly given we've targeted him for two seasons straight now, I have to believe we will get it done.

Glad he sort of calls out klopp as well. Klopp and pep showed alot of arrogance last summer when talking about our midfield. Is it entirely their fault ? Definitely not , FSG are still the main culprits but they have made some odd decisions.

I think realistically the summer goes two ways: 

1. We sign Jude and a cheaper project midfielder. We then sign someone on a free e.g rabiot or tielemans ( I don't want either ) 


2. We don't sign Jude. We go for caicedo + Mount + a prospect ( Kone /Ugarte / Enzo le fee )

This compared to Robertson whereby opposition players always send a cross in after pushing him backwards near the box and players ghost into the box from the middle. Also tracking runners is key. We literally need our CM‚Äôs to track opposition runners and things can become better. The amount of times Gundo and KDB ghosted into the box was concerning because our cms don‚Äôt track anyone.

He‚Äôs not been brought in to be a replacement, he was brought in to be different. Our ‚Äúnatural‚Äù system has become predictable, Nunez makes us more unpredictable. 

For years it‚Äôs been a false nine controlling and linking up play with our fullbacks providing creativity and it has led to low blocks, smothering the box so our forwards couldn‚Äôt get on the end of Trent and Robertson‚Äôs crosses, and useless possession in the middle of the park. No one has to game plan for us anymore, they already know what we‚Äôre going to do. Now, we have a pacey, natural striker that has the ability to get in and shoot in the box, wingers with space who can cut in and don‚Äôt get wasted trying to get on the end of crosses, and a better system to counter quickly. 

Of course, we also have the players to continue the system that we‚Äôve been playing with (Gakpo instead of Firmino now), which means that we actually have the ability to change tactically depending on the opponent so instead of trying to put a square peg into a round hole we can put a square peg or a round peg depending on whether it‚Äôs a square hole or round hole. Due to injury, midfield play, etc. we‚Äôve largely had to stick with our old system and Nunez we hasn‚Äôt been finishing as he should when he does get in the box, but now that our forward line is back, and when we get a functional midfield, opponents will have to actually think before we play them.",Liverpool,No,jes6m89,t3_12aa0pz

‚ÄúThey probably won't get Caicedo, unless they pay twice the summer 2022 asking price (but the agents were taking the piss, and you should never give in to agents taking the piss, lest you set a precedent as mugs; plus, the price for that deal was rising all the time, from what I heard, and you can‚Äôt be fleeced)‚Äù

 Comments like these is why I have no hope for this fanbase. At least before this season the fanbase was United that Fsg is the problem now I see these kinda comments become a norm and people will start wanting Klopp out.

Only Fsg wins in this ultimately. They have played it brilliantly this season with all the PR propoganda, first made sure people thought club is for sale, then said that external investment is on its way. Neither looks likely. 

 Now Paul joyce is making it look like it's Klopp's fault for wanting a world class player in the team instead of a few average players that Fsg can afford even after all these years of overachieving on the field. 

Looks like the low expectations is locked in and likes of John Henry will escape as usual because some people aren't capable of looking at the big picture.

Our right-back - particularly when the opposition has the ball - should be kinda on the right and kinda at the back. Not hooning around closing down their goalie. 

I could happily never see Gomez play again at centre back, but I think he's still got plenty to offer at right-back. TAA offers unquestionable qualities going forward and from set pieces... sometimes. We just need a bit of stability and reliability, and that's a good place to start.

We're not adapting to use him, we're forcing him into a pre-existing tactic and not even adapting that to really play to his strengths beyond 'hit it long, he's quick'.

Hopefully when Dias returns he'll go up top. But then, unless we change system to a 4231, where does Gakpo go?

"Milner doesn't get hate for being Milner. He's a consummate professional and always gives his all. 

Milner gets hate because he represents what's wrong with the club. Using a 36 year old to plug gaps in midfield and the RB position when a club at the top should be looking to strengthen in those areas.

The obligatory Milner sub when we are winning by multiple goals rather than blooding a youngster into the side.",Liverpool,Yes,jere71c,t1_jer9s48
"I think with Milner the frustration is more about how we‚Äôve found ourselves relying on him as a starter at times, or that he‚Äôs been brought on to chase a losing game.

People aren‚Äôt annoyed at him, they‚Äôre annoyed at being in a situation that means our only/best option at times is a man who‚Äôs 37.

I think Milner‚Äôs actually been one of our better players this season, but I totally get the frustration that people have when he plays. He isn‚Äôt the problem, the fact that we have to rely on playing him is.",Liverpool,Yes,jerbn4i,t1_jer9s48
"I like him, will always love him but it‚Äôs a representation of how we‚Äôve completely neglected the midfield when he‚Äôs still an option",Liverpool,Yes,jerdpul,t1_jer9s48
"Because Milner is a representation of how neglected the midfield has been.

No one hates Milner, man's iconic. It's not about him. What we hate is having to regularly play a 37 year old midfielder in 2023 because there's no options.",Liverpool,Yes,jerbip6,t1_jer9s48
"I agree. He's not at all a bad option for a deep rotation option in the midfield. If he lessens his wages on his new deal (which will happen), him coming back is fine. He's not the player staying that would end up having us not bring in more midfielders in the summer. Also, Milner's often done well when subbed on or even in his few starts this season. Notably Man City at home. He's been reliable and dependable for someone who isn't a key player but more rotates in sometimes (and most often as a substitute).",Liverpool,Yes,jera10x,t1_jer9s48
"He has done little things that cost us, multiple times, but they're things he can't sufficiently address, like losing the ball because he lacks agility, or lacks the speed to close the distance. He's the least dynamic player in our whole squad.",Liverpool,Yes,jerjsmz,t1_jer9s48
"He always did his job when coming on wheter helping organising the midfield, defending, holding the ball, etc. For a 38 years old footballer that's pretty damn good enough, his wage isn't that high, good for dressing room and young players in our team, one more year with him will not hurt us, also he is preparing his coaching license now, i can see he will be working for our youth team",Liverpool,Yes,jerc16y,t1_jer9s48

Looking at the stats, it looks like he is averaging less minutes per game, even less this season compared to last season however it feels like at this stage, he should have been phased out already. Like he should be in the range of 25-35 games a season",Liverpool,Yes,jerb0d7,t1_jer9s48
"I don't have a bad word to say about Milner, He's been a top pro with an unreal career stretching nearly 20 years, but at pushing 40, we don't need to give him a new contract. 

We aren't a better team with him in it anymore that's just facts. The fact he's started both games against Napoli, against Madrid, City, United etc just shows how bad the midfield problem is. But giving Milner an extension doesn't help that imo.

Every reply to you is saying stuff like, top pro, model proffesional, good with young lads, good to have around the changing room etc etc. Nothing about his ability, because he isn't good enough anymore. Yet has still played 33 times for us this season.

We need to move on.",Liverpool,Yes,jerldbz,t1_jer9s48

"I was kind of losing interest in Caicedo by the time he was linked with Arsenal and his whole ""pls let me go"" Instagram bollocks.

That stat about ETH having 3 points less than last season at this stage is a fake stat. He‚Äôs played 2 less games,Liverpool,Yes,jeu472n,t1_jeu2x60
Don't think so. He played both the latest U21 games for England and did well. He's likely not impressing in training of he's behind Melo and Chamberlain.,Liverpool,Yes,jernnhv,t1_jermm3o
"Unless we take 6 points in our next 2, the season is over. And if that's the case I have no problem with Jones having a run of games to see if he can prove something to us. 

But I think the fact he can't make the squad most games when we have one of the worst midfields in the league with players injured, and the likes of Ox and Arthur who won't be here next season are getting ahead of him in the pecking order. I think that says everything tbh.",Liverpool,Yes,jern2jw,t1_jermm3o
"Jones has shinsplint issues, so he can't train everyday, something like he can only train/play every other day.

3rd is definitely possible the team just needs to wake tf up,Liverpool,Yes,jeu5wcb,t1_jeu5cwk
You don‚Äôt need to have hope for a fanbase. It‚Äôs a fanbase. What‚Äôs spouted on here and Twitter isn‚Äôt the talk of the streets.,Liverpool,Yes,jesvbzt,t1_jeshtpi
"I agree with all your points RE: FSG, but I also dont think it's falling for propaganda to suggest that Klopp has played a small part in our woes this season also, the man himself would admit that.

He has acknowledged before that there are weaknesses and blind spots in his management style, and has alluded to surrounding himself with people he trusts to take care of those matters. 

Sticking with players that are well past their sell by date is an obvious glaring issue. Its exactly what happened at Dortmund and their squad stagnated after being pushed to its limits.

Keita, Milner and Bobby were going to be offered new deals, that's kind of crazy to think about. Ox should have been gone yesterday. We can say that's down to lack of investment but all four are on fat contracts, two of which to do nothing and contribute zero to the squad.

It would actually be cheaper in the long run to have gotten rid and replaced them with younger, hungrier players on lower wages. 

Another issue is our playing/training style, which is causing fatigue and absolutely riddled us with injuries. One season of that is a blip, but it's become far more frequent and is obviously something we are doing wrong. That's not on FSG, we have a huge squad and one of the highest wage bills in the league, but so many of them are perpetually injured. 

We should sack everyone before we sack Klopp but I can't lay the sole blame at FSGs door. This is a multifaceted issue, with failures at virtually every level.",Liverpool,Yes,jesn68c,t1_jeshtpi

I‚Äôd take few averages players like we did during 2016-2018, than Bellingham and inshallah and Milner extension anyday

If you want fsg spent like City, Chelsea then ask Jurgen to go do full Conte. Or start the protests

Spurs choking is not enough. We also need another one of the mancs or Newcastle to also choke. Too many ifs for my liking. Failure to win tomorrow and it's finished (if it's not too late already).,Liverpool,Yes,jetzbqg,t1_jetyfcq
"I wouldn't mind seeing Gomez get a game at RB.

I defo wouldn't be dropping Salah for Doak though, very weird shout that.",Liverpool,Yes,jes7sxj,t1_jes7lcx
"Having Gomez get some gametime is a decent shout especially with Trent‚Äôs form and a few decent cameos there last season from Gomez.

Benching Salah is a horrible take. You can say what you want about his overall play this season but he has been carrying us statically this season. While I do think Doak should 100% making the bench ahead of some players, he should never start ahead of Salah.",Liverpool,Yes,jesbndy,t1_jes7lcx
"Salah is 34G/A this season in 40 games, wtf you mean bench him. The disrespect is unreal, the best winger the PL has ever seen... He is not the only attacker in the side Salah doing the usual numbers. In the past Mane and Jota would take some burned as it a team game. Salah team mates are letting him down. 

Last season mane got 20 goals Jota was on 21 goals then you had Mino on 10. We lost 50 odd goals and not replaced them. Salah has had bad games this season but the whole fucking team has been shit. But  Jota Diaz or Mane would carry some weight and score a goal.

Salah right now should be our captain! He and Ali are the only player who want CL football.

VVD, Robbo,Hendo, Fab,TAA are all to be questioned.",Liverpool,Yes,jes9ybz,t1_jes7lcx
"What message is benching Trent sending? I agree with giving him a rest, but if you're trying to give him a kick up the arse it's not going to work.

""Here, Trent, have some games on the bench until we come crawling back in a few weeks after losing every game because we've got no one competent to fill in for you""",Liverpool,Yes,jesgx11,t1_jes7lcx
"Agree with the sentiment regarding Trent needing a break but it needs to be for a few games to have any effect and we simply have no one competent or fit enough to put in for that long. That option has been in the treatment room all season.

As for Mo? Doak isn't there yet and Harvey on the wing feels a little slow and lacking a trick. I wonder - can Gakpo play there? Him and Darwin either side of Jota would be worth a look. Or Dias when he returns",Liverpool,Yes,jesawuy,t1_jes7lcx
"I'd sooner take Milner at RB, because despite everything going against him in that position he actually gives a fuck.

How do people keep replenishing their grace for Gomez this season when he's had some of the worst individual performances among our players? Is there a collective memory lapse here every couple of weeks?",Liverpool,Yes,jesntji,t1_jes7lcx
Gomez is horrible at RB. He offers barely anything and his positioning is at least just as bad. He doesn‚Äôt push forward and still get caught out of position or fucks up defending any cross into his area,Liverpool,Yes,jes8s28,t1_jes7lcx
"We get nothing out of playing him now though imo. We obviously aren't gonna sign him permanently so It'd just be a risk by playing him. 

Although top 4 is more or less gone. IF we somehow took 6 points this week we'd be right back in the running.",Liverpool,Yes,jes4upz,t1_jes1wqh

Masterclass on the bench passing the water bottle from left to right.,Liverpool,Yes,jesifn5,t1_jesgnf3
"I was thinking today about it- who else is there?
Starting Henderson again seems risky, likewise Elliot didn‚Äôt perform well against City, so you‚Äôd think maybe Fabinho, Milner and one more might start - I suppose of Ox, Elliot, Jones and Arthur, it‚Äôs hard to say who is likely to be most ready. Elliot definitely is the most match fit, so is the obviously choice, but the risk of over-playing him too is that he has a run of bad games and suddenly he‚Äôs even more of a scapegoat for fans. 

I would be amazed if Arthur starts tbf, but would be really curious to see it. I do hope he gets a game or two before the end of the season, even if it is just 30 mins off the bench here and there.",Liverpool,Yes,jesi13y,t1_jesgnf3
"""misjudged"" should tell you that it is an opinion. Also, signing Arthur showed, that he did see we needed a midfielder. But if you sign Arthur you know that there is no money",Liverpool,Yes,jerg30e,t1_jerfz7a

"Nah Nunez doesn't lol. You can't have that real x factor if you aren't a quality player. Nunez's x factor is like ASM's x factor.

"For me Suarez' 'x factor' was his natural instinct and ability improvise in all kinds of situations. As weird as it sounds, I feel like Mo has more of the latter than the former.

"All jokes aside, even Bajcetic proves my initial point as well, even just injecting him into our side saw a small uptick in performances and results both of which have since slipped again since his injury and he‚Äôs not even close to world class. 

Adding 3 top class CMs to our squad allowing us to use the likes of Tiago and Hendo sparingly whilst continuing to integrate youngesters like Baj and Elliott would make the world of difference next season.",Liverpool,Yes,jerbfun,t1_jer9sjy
Seeing all over Twitter people are fuming he awkwardly embraced pep after their 4th goal,Liverpool,Yes,jerjdoa,t1_jerj2gt

"When I speak about the city game, I‚Äôm also talking about in general as well. I look at the goal whereby Trent blocked the first shot, it‚Äôs like no one reacted after that, everyone just watched while Trent was just watching.

Only Liverpool has to balance the books.",Liverpool,Yes,jerwcv4,t1_jertwmq

"I feel the United squad is gonna get stretched thin as they go deeper in Europa league and fa cup. In the last three games they had a good chance of taking a lead in the top four race but they have bottled it and only managed to get 1 point. 

Futher injuries can complicate matter even further. Their midfield isn't deep enough and outside of Rashford and Bruno they don't have many goal scorers. 

Newcastle might drop silly points away from home to relegation teams. A lot will depend how clinical they are with Isak.

If we can maybe win all our home fixtures including spurs and arsenal and not manage to lose away we might have an outside chance.",Liverpool,Yes,jeugwce,t1_jeug32y
Just get Mount to sell it to Rice. They're practically brothers.,Liverpool,Yes,jet9mn5,t1_jet9j64

Yes he should have played an injured keita and ox double pivot this season.,Liverpool,Yes,jesg3yu,t1_jesfe8w
"Klopp has constantly been fighting to have games spaced out more, to have more than 3 subs in the Prem, and all of our midfield, center back and full back depth have had massive injury crisis's preventing rotation or not being good enough to rotate with",Liverpool,Yes,jetdmua,t1_jesfe8w
Perfectly put,Liverpool,Yes,jeskc08,t1_jesg7yg
Aka we should move to a 4-2-3-1,Liverpool,Yes,jesttyu,t1_jesg7yg
"Of course we haven't, we haven't been able to yet. I guess I wasn't clear enough. I said that we have wingers and a pacey striker. I thought it was obvious that I was talking about Nunez as the striker seeing as the whole post was about him, and when I said ""due to injuries"" that it was Diaz, Jota and Firmino who I was referring to (who else could I have been referring in the context of this?).

We started the season with Diaz on the wing with Nunez was being eased in behind Firmino so was actually initally played centrally (and he wasn't played as a false nine, I might add). When you say we should be playing Firmino in the middle, well he was, and was our top scorer early in the season... and then he got injured. Also, just as Nunez was starting to be played more centrally Diaz and Jota got injured and all of a sudden we needed a left winger and since Nunez had been played on the left at Benfica he was clearly the only person we had to fill that role. So, we got Gakpo in January, who is clearly a Firmino replacement and since we only had the players to maintain what we had, namely Nunez as the only decent left sided attacker, he stayed on the wing.

With our midfield, which has been trash all season, we didn't have the luxury of using a ten, we needed more defensive solidity (though, it hasn't helped much) so it remained the 4-3-3 with a false nine. The whole change I was writing about was predicated on Gakpo, false 9, and Nunez, true 9, being rotated depending on the opponent while Diaz and Salah remained on the wings. We don't need to shoehorn a 10 in, all we need is Gakpo and Nunez shifting roles in the middle to completely change our attack.",Liverpool,Yes,jetczrj,t1_jesg7yg
"That‚Äôs a great point. Up to this point Nunez has succeeded purely because of his incredible physical attributes. The way we play now he can only score off counters and set pieces, like most of our team. We need tactical changes.",Liverpool,Yes,jestn60,t1_jesk9zv
"We didn't adjust to him because we weren't able to. Our left winger/s got injured, so who else is playing there? Oh, probably the one who used to play on the left all the time until he moved to Liverpool.",Liverpool,Yes,jeteuv9,t1_jesk9zv
"Gakpo and Nunez will be rotated centrally, I think Jota is the super sub moving forward, being subbed in along the line and starting the occassional game. Gakpo and Nunez are both excellent center forwards, and also very different players, so all that is needed to change our tactics drastically is switching them to change shape. He's only been on the wing due to injury. Pure and simple. He was being played down the middle before that happened, it's just forgotten about because he was being eased in and we didn't see it for long, until he was forced to play on the left.",Liverpool,Yes,jetecxc,t1_jestt17

"I feel he's a fairly ideal signing outside of the demands of Brighton and his agents. But the latter is the biggest factor. I definitely agree we should be looking elsewhere and that he's not *that* essential. There's got to be other cheaper players out there who bring the same qualities he would.

I also can't get over the fact they signed him for only ¬£4.5m. I know he's developed a lot in a very short time, and maybe we couldn't give him that development ourselves, but the premium is obscene.",Liverpool,Yes,jet2kyq,t1_jet0hux

"This Dormuntd thing you are saying is totally wrong. Even they supported Klopp more than Fsg has done.

If you actually look at their spend. They were spending the second most in their league second only to Bayern. 

It's for a good reason Dormuntd hasn't won a single singifcant trophy and has multiple managers ever since Klopp left. He was the one person who was making the club punch above their weight. They defeated real Madrid 4-1 in aggregate and made a final after 20 years, won a league back to back. Hell even Carlo hasn't managed to do that in his 26 years in management. 

The only manager to win a league other than Bayern, it isn't a surprise that they haven't won the league 10 years in a row now. Klopp had his players leave for Bayern due to their managements issues. 

Lewa ran down the contract cause he only wanted to leave for Bayern and gotze had his release clause triggered. In both cases Klopp was helpless. 

Also the players didn't stagnate. They had injuries and the stats showed a different picture that they were extremely unlucky, Fsg hired Klopp after analysing the situation. Their xG was a lot higher on paper, they were just unlucky that they couldn't finish their chances. 

The squad came back post december break and made a final and finished 7th this is as bad as people make it out to be. Mourinho finished 10th with a peak chelsea squad. Next season they strengthened with Conte and won the league.

>Keita, Milner and Bobby were going to be offered new deals, that's kind of crazy to think about. Ox should have been gone yesterday. We can say that's down to lack of investment but all four are on fat contracts, two of which to do nothing and contribute zero to the squad.

Milner isn't as bad as people make him out to be just cause he is 37 doesn't mean he doesn't contribute when called upon. He literally pocketed foden just this year, I have no problem with him giving him an extension. Cause we have home grown issues as well which people convivently ignore we have about three home gown players leaving this summer so I have no problem with keeping Milner. 

Also no Journalist has said they have offered Milner a new deal, even joyce is repeating it from a press conference which Klopp said Milner might stay with the club three months ago. No source has come out and said Milner has been offered a new deal, same with Keita. 

People just love to keep repeating these things just to make Klopp look bad and to protect Fsg. Keita is on his way out, so is bobby and most likely Milner as well until he signs a deal. So people should just stop repeating it. It's getting boring. Come back to it at the end of the season and if these players have signed a new deal I'll raise my hand and apologize. 

Fsg have lied to you lot multiple times now. Yet you guys have some weird faith they will spend. First it was Super league,  then Tom Werner said the club is for sale and now external investment. They keep spinning this eternal hope and everybody keeps falling for the same old trick.

I am of the belief Klopp should walk if he doesn't gets the players he wants. Why tarnish your legacy where the fanbase and the owners don't support you. Go to a club which has your back.",Liverpool,Yes,jesr77s,t1_jesn68c
"Brah you people have no individual capacity to think or what? Are you online 24/7 on twitter following no name randos  who are butt hurt over something Klopp said 6 months ago. 

Do you not see how his actions contradict the things he says? Instead of looking at quotes just look at the finances of the club available at the club. 

Don't you think those finances contribute to things these people say? You act like red sox and penguins are swimming with money and their fans have no issue with Fsg? Or they are not known to use Propaganda as a tool, why do you think boston globe exists. 

Next you are gonna start blaming Klopp for super league.",Liverpool,Yes,jesn8rs,t1_jesmit4

">Salah is 34G/A this season in 40 games, wtf you mean bench him. The disrespect is unreal

He's always been disrespected, IDK why. It just feels like a lot of our fans have never took to him. So bizarre.",Liverpool,Yes,jescv0v,t1_jes9ybz
"It's not disrespectful at all to give Mo a game off occasionally. Even peak Ronaldo wasn't playing 50+ matches per year in Madrid when he was bagging 50 goals per season, and he was essentially a robot. I can still consider him an all time great while believing a game off here and there throughout a campaign would help his stay fresh late in seasons. He was the greatest player in the world for half of last year. I don't think anyone is questioning his ability or production.",Liverpool,Yes,jeshpum,t1_jes9ybz
Haha... fair point! xD,Liverpool,Yes,jeskg3f,t1_jesgx11

"Strange how you've been downvoted haha, surely people don't think Arthur is playing tomorrow?",Liverpool,Yes,jeslvtx,t1_jesifn5
"I think we‚Äôll at least see him as a sub tomorrow if it‚Äôs not a start. Midfield tomorrow is probably going to be Fab, Elliot, and Milner. I think Arthur and Jones will be subbed on",Liverpool,Yes,jesl9oy,t1_jesi13y
"Klopp could tell us himself that he fucked up and we‚Äôd say No babe you didn‚Äôt. Oh wait.. he did tell us? ‚Äòyou were right, I was wrong?‚Äô. Who is Arthur Melo ? I don‚Äôt know him. From what I remember I swear he was chronically unfit and the call for him was made the moment Henderson got injured on the last day on the transfer window? So if Henderson had not gotten injured who wouldn‚Äôt have gotten this so called Arthur ?

The fact he rejected midfielders after tchou so that his favourite players (sentiment) could continue to get game time has been reported ALL SEASON by so many journalists, anfield talk/edition/watch have repeated this so many times. Why on earth does everyone on twitter know this but everyone on here is completely unaware? When you say it you‚Äôre met with 10 dislikes",Liverpool,Yes,jerg8bx,t1_jerg30e
"1 competent midfielder could have helped us get top 4 considering where we are now. Obviously not in all certainty but I‚Äôd rather see a competent midfielder in that team than bloody Harvey Elliot and Henderson and Fabinho. Just 1- and Klopp had the choice for just one. I just can‚Äôt believe it. We‚Äôve moved away from data and those small signings. Robertson being signed made a difference didn‚Äôt he. These were scouted players, of course 1 would have made some difference. Not we, Klopp fucked up big time.",Liverpool,Yes,jerii23,t1_jericcj
His price would drop massively if they get relegated and he‚Äôs no where near shite. He‚Äôs a top player,Liverpool,Yes,jeu0rk3,t1_jeu0mpi

"I can't define it in words in all honesty. I guess if you had to describe in words what Suarez has that Salah is lacking, what would you say that is?",Liverpool,Yes,jesz1zg,t1_jeswt8a
Boggles my mind how people could have this exact same take six months later when in multiple games he‚Äôs looked like the only player who was trying and the only player who looked like he could score. Nothing he could do to please you at this point,Liverpool,Yes,jetkgh4,t1_jetiobu
"In terms of attracting targets it doesn't actually matter whether you're in CL or not. Especially if it's a blip like it should be for us.

The difference is, owners like FSG will probably use it as an excuse to not invest heavily like is needed.

Nowhere he is mentioning that 200 mill will be available for transfers. In his previous article he has mentioned that Fsg don't think external investment is needed for the rebuild.

And what do you mean by Gakpo and Nunez shifting roles in the middle if we don‚Äôt play them at the same time? Us playing 433 with Nunez at the moment is useless as all it does is create huge gaps.

"Of course we don't value him for 50 mill when we didn't value him for 38 mill previously.

These lot want every player for 20 mill apparently. In the same article he mentioned Caicedo which is pointless as he will cost 70 mill plus.

"Doak has made the bench a couple of times this season and played 24 minutes. To even contemplate dropping Salah for him is laughable. 

Salah, I agree has been no way near his best. but he has 34 G/A. And goals win games. Dropping him for an unproven teenager won't be a good move for anyone involved. Doak would end up just getting abuse when we ultimately end up losing them games.

I'd be more than happy to see Doak get some minutes off the bench towards the end of the season if we don't have anything to play for but suggesting him to start away at Stamford bridge or against Arsenal is just stupid.",Liverpool,Yes,jeschol,t1_jes94yq
Doak is an exciting young prospect but he's nowhere near ready to deputise for Salah. Would be a mistake to ruin a youngster's confidence in the remainder of this toxic season.,Liverpool,Yes,jes9hz4,t1_jes94yq
"People are just saying he needs a rest here or there after playing 50+ matches every season since he's joined the club. He's also been top 2 in jersey sales every year since we bought him so he's not exactly unpopular.

Mo and Robbo are my two favorite current players, but I still want them to play fewer minutes since you see the cumulative effect of the past few years is catching up with everyone. There was a time when Hendo, Gini and Fab were also considered workhorses that could play every minute until they couldn't.",Liverpool,Yes,jesjrbp,t1_jescv0v

He had two good games and that's about it. But most of the bad stuff I remember was him playing at centre back...?,Liverpool,Yes,jesxo4d,t1_jesvues
"It's quite clearly obviously a risk haha. 

He's played a combined 13 minutes and hasn't played a single minute since September and hasn't started a game since May. 

I agree our midfield has been abysmal, but somehow our record against the top teams has still been 'ok' ish this season. Which still makes the next 2 games important. So he isn't worth risking in them imo.

If we lose them or take 1 or 2 points then yes the season is over and then if he plays or not I couldn't care less. But if we have nothing to play for why play a player who won't be here next season?

Why not play the likes of Jones, Carvalho etc.",Liverpool,Yes,jes7jxg,t1_jes5g33
"Arthur has been fit for weeks now. When he isn't getting 5 mins towards the end of the game why are people believing he would actually start all of a sudden. 

If I was Klopp I wouldn't play him, to send out a message to the owners.

"Some people are unable to read between the lines. The fact that Klopp's said many times that he's responsible for on-field things and that others are responsible for supplying the resources should tell you everything you need to know.

"That‚Äôs the thing mate, I think Salah does have what Suarez had. Suarez 13/14 is the best Liverpool performer I‚Äôve ever seen, but Salah has goals in his locker that are in the same vein. If Salah‚Äôs goals against Man City and Watford back to back last season weren‚Äôt Suarez level, I‚Äôm not sure what is.

I‚Äôd say Salah absolutely does have the X factor, he‚Äôs just not really had a purple patch this season where he looks like scoring every game.",Liverpool,Yes,jet6kpj,t1_jesz1zg

"It matters for us. We don't pay as big wages as the competition and our owners have almost no ambition for the club if it deviates from their plan of maximum profits for them.

"Because Klopp is a world class manager who has enough credit in the bank to get a chance to turn this around.

"I thought the criticism of Rodgers was too harsh in all honesty. I'm always giving managers time and I dont easily forget the success they achieve. It's far easier being a fan watching on than actually achieving the things the club has. 

And here's a big thing: Klopp won us the league. I waited thirty years for that, and one bad season doesn't erase it. He's not infallible but theres no one else I'd want in charge and it takes an awful lot more than playing Milner (who's still had decent performances this season and is happy being a rotational option) to change that.",Liverpool,Yes,jeriu0w,t1_jeradfi
Has anyone said that he was one of the best players in the club? Or are you just saying that to try and justify yourself?,Liverpool,Yes,jerblt5,t1_jera9y6

He‚Äôs played RB, LB, the 8 and the 6 this season. We would be worse off without him.",Liverpool,Yes,jerdz0g,t1_jera9y6

"And that's fair, but the focus was near entirely on general rotation and depth, we were not talking about them looking like complete shadows of themselves in a matter of months.

"Probably you are right, but we need HG player there still. 
Idk what goalkeepers will be on free this summer. Got any ideas?",Liverpool,Yes,jerurhi,t1_jeru9zd
"I feel we really need Thiago as fast as possible. He has experience of being in the exact same position before we went on a 10 game winning streak.

Bajcetic getting injured at the wrong time has really hurt us. 

Thiago, fabinho and Henderson would have been Liverpool's first choice midfield just last season. 

As for united I do believe they drop out of the top four race, Brentford, spurs and  Brighton away are tough games.

In between they face Chelsea maybe with a manager bounce and face all the relegation candidates in Westham, wolves, Bournemouth and Everton. All these teams will be fighting with their life. 

A draw here or there will hurt them.",Liverpool,Yes,jeukocf,t1_jeujsls
You could argue they‚Äôre burnt out and rightly so but the way they‚Äôve been acting and expressing on the pitch goes beyond tired legs. At this point the sooner the season is over the better so we can actually go to the drawing board.,Liverpool,Yes,jesj5ez,t1_jesgkd2
"In my original post I see I wasn‚Äôt that clear in that regard, so I apologize. I meant that once all of our forwards are healthy, and I was also regarding this more towards next season, I was trying to convey that with Nunez in the box it gives the wingers more space to cut in and exploit that space. So that space where Bobby would have been playing would be covered more by Salah and Diaz (and hopefully a more robust midfield‚Ä¶) and the fullbacks would be able to overlap without crowding the the wingers so much. If Gakpo plays instead of Nunez it‚Äôs the familiar 4-3-3 however.

*Also, I did misread your comment a little bit, and I‚Äôm glad we brought Gakpo in because what you‚Äôre saying was happening. I think he‚Äôs done a good job filling the Bobby role now, but before that I agree, we should have been using a 10.",Liverpool,Yes,jetrj8z,t1_jetpq9j
"I could see that happening at some point, it would be interesting at least, but I think we‚Äôll stick largely with 4-3-3. Also depends on the midfielders. If we got Jude, for example, would he be as useful in double pivot (serious question, I don‚Äôt know)? If we do end up with two solid defensive midfielders (potentially Bajcetic and someone?) then that would definitely change things up",Liverpool,Yes,jetpvz0,t1_jetorr2
"Yeah exactly, Milner roles are basically the connection between the staff and the players, but Klopp relied on him every matches rather than give young players a chances was completely wrong

"Keita has been horrible this season, in the Palace game he lost the ball so many times and got a yellow before half time because of a reckless challenge.

"We are talking about an ownership which decided to clarify their status at the club when they saw a plane fly over anfield with an Fsg out banner. Previous to that they didn't bother for three months to tell the fans anything. 

And this is the same ownership who decided to do a staged apology video for the super league. The only ownership which felt the need to do so because of people on social media being Fsg out.

">what about his tactics, run player into the ground, injury crisis, literally everything thats fully on him thats not about investment?‚Äù

Which tactics work without a proper midfield ? Tell me a club which has managed to win anything without a proper midfield? 

Chelsea are literally 11th without Kante and kovacic not available for the majority of this season and they have a big squad. 

Also re injury crises - if you sign injury prone players like ox and Arthur why are you surprised they are injured? Just look at their history of injuries. Are you gonna blame Klopp now for ox being an injury prone individual or for Arthur? 

Konate and Thiago had injury issues. Even Bayern fans said that Thiago will only be available for 20-30 games what do you do? Let Gini leave and not replace him.

Just cause Matip, ox and keita had one good season without being injured doesn't mean they won't be injured again. 

These are recruitment issues not Klopp issues.  

Why not cancel, ox and keita contract and recruit players? No no you need to spend money for that. What's the alternative let's go get a player who has been injured for most of his playing career and then let's blame Klopp for that. Make it make sense. 

>Also he‚Äôs literally most powerful man in the club, he have his final word to almost everything, do you think why Edwards, Ward and Graham are leaving?

This is like asking why do individuals get a new job? Edwards was literally at the club for ten years, he left and hadn't gotten a new job yet why? Maybe he doesn't want to. 

Ward has rejected the ajax deal. Why? Maybe he doesn't want to work as a DOF. Maybe he never wanted to and was forced into it. 

Ian Graham is a physicist who is going back to his field of work and teaching.
It takes literally mins to search this information on the net, but why would you do that when you can just follow some random idiot on twitter and blame Klopp.",Liverpool,Yes,jessoas,t1_jeso4sf
"But Salah isn't in bad form atm, 8 G/A in his last 7 PL games. He's probably the only outfield player that looks like he cares at times. 

He had a bad run of form before this run but he played every minute then and he's turned his form back round. Also asking him to be rested would be asking Nunez/Jota/Diaz or Gakpo to play there, not a unproven teenager who has played 20 minutes all season and hasn't even been in the matchday squad for the last 4 months. If you think that's the same you need to give your head a wobble.

Makes it even stranger the fact we have two tough games coming up but teams Salah has a good record against but we should drop him for Doak. Fucking hell haha.

It's also totally different to Robbo because we have a decent capable Left back to bring in for him. But I agree Robbo is dying for a rest. Been shocking last couple of games.",Liverpool,Yes,jeslcm3,t1_jesjrbp
"Exactly, he's missed 1 game through injury since 2016 and he's pretty much started every single game in them 7 years as well. To have someone with that level of fitness and be injury free is literally unheard off. Something only very few players have ever done really.

And then add 253 G/A in 290 games to that as well. All from the wing. 

He will go down as arguably the best ever PL winger and will go down as one of our best ever players.

Yet some one here wanted him sold over Mane in the summer. Or want him gone this summer.",Liverpool,Yes,jesmyfs,t1_jesm07w

""Top players"" is far too broad a brush to be painting with. Bellingham is a tier above someone like Diaz for example.

> Arsenal finished 5th and haven't been in the CL for for 7 years and signed Jesus and Zinchenko

This is exactly my point. These players aren't in the same bracket as someone like Jude Bellingham. They were let go by City because they weren't needed anymore, and didn't exactly have clubs falling all over themselves to sign them. On top of this, I'm not sure City would've let them go to anyone in the champions league that was good enough to cause problems. That basically meant it was Arsenal, or somewhere abroad, and given the difference in finances they're gonna choose Arsenal every time.

> Casemiro starts every single week for Madrid leaves to go to 6th place UTD.

Gotta say this one did surprise me, but when you've won 5 champions leagues already and a team comes with a project and a fuck load of cash then that's again a very different situation to Bellingham.

> I just think there is more to transfers and attracting players to whether you finish 4th or 5th.

People keep asking whether just Bellingham alone would fix Liverpool.. but we're at a point where i'm not certain a new midfield would fix this team. From where i'm standing, we need 3-4 midfielders (at the least 3 should be ready to slot into the starting XI), a starting quality centerback as Van Dijk is no longer him and Konate is prone to an injury, and a rotation option as well because Matip and Gomez are washed. A rightback that can properly challenge Trent for his spot because that man sorely needs it.

We're talking about 7 first-team signings here, and i'm legit being conservative because as far as i'm concerned we need 7 midfielders alone. If Klopp chooses to stay, he has a big rebuild on his hands, and i wouldn't be so sure that we'll bounce right back next season either. 

My conclusion is that this is on FSG and Klopp both for not refreshing a squad that lost the league and the CL in the space of a week and letting the rot set within. When you have Van Dijk saying twice in a season that we could use some signings, it's clear that there's a lack of confidence in that dressing room - the players no longer believe in the team and they've gotten more cynical about our chances to win silverware.

At the moment neither of those things is happening, and we don't even have the squad capable of doing that. Ox came on and did nothing, Gomez has been robbed of his pace and went from being a rock beside van Dijk to a liability. Ramsey I'm sure might even rotate with Trent if he wasn't injured all the time either.

So if we can't press, the options I guess are to go lower block, reduce a bit of the phsycial demands and play counterattacking, and tell Nunez to play as a poacher. He has the pace. Or we ignore Ox and Keita, be a bit braver and pick some reserve players who should be fresher? The football may not be pretty, but rn it doesn't matter as long as we start picking three points up again consistently. There is still a chance at top four (Spurs are Spurs, even with managerial changes rn) but it needs us to take it.

His appearances thus far this season have been largely disappointing. He's been found out defensively on numerous occasions and even his attacking output has fallen below his usual lofty standards. I would love to know exactly what goes on behind the scenes at the club and how much scrutiny is applied to the defensive side of his game. Because, either way, I see it as two options:  
\- He's either under scrutiny at the club, but just doesn't seem to be improving defensively (which would be concerning)  
\- Or, the club doesn't see it as a real issue (also concerning)  


Don't get me wrong, I know his defensive woes aren't solely due to him. The midfield isn't providing him much cover and his defensive counterparts as a whole have been sub-par.

"I'm honestly tired of people slating Klopp for his tactics. There's no way to make proactive football work without an energetic/overly technical midfield.

Either you have a team of slick passers who can dance around the opposing team like Xavi, Iniesta, Busquets or the spain of the early 2000s, or you need to press. In the best case you have both but life doesn't always work that way. 

In the absence of legs we have nothing. People keep harping on Klopp refusing to change shape but we have on numerous occasions including yesterday and it doesn't matter. 

We've tried 1-2, we've tried a flat four, we've tried a diamond and even the box but we simply lacked the energy to compete, and obviously we weren't going to beat City's midfield on technique. Ultimately Fabinho and Henderson failed to cover their spaces properly, and Elliott/Gakpo were slow to their men multiple times. 

Don't believe me? Here's some screenshots. 

From the source that can't be named

[3rd minute](https://imgur.com/a/FuGWxZA) Klopps reason for playing the box here is clear. City was playing a box too and this allowed us to press their 2 deep with 2 (Elliott and Gakpo), with Henderson and Fabinho distinctly sitting deep and parallel to each other, Jota and Salah pressing up top. 

[12 min](https://imgur.com/hG5lIVk) 
Another shape we employed was to have Salah and Gakpo sitting on their deep 2 instead, with Elliott and Jota forming a flatter back four. This we used when play progressed further. 

[20th minute](https://imgur.com/wn8KwTV)
Once again the double pivot is clear. Harvey Elliott and Jota are level. 

[In the build up to their 1st goal](https://imgur.com/7l5v1RH) Fabinho and Henderson are neither zonally blocking out their advanced 2 nor marking their deep 2. But clearly a double pivot/flat four from us here. 

[Crucial moment for the second goal](https://imgur.com/Wjl4Jkz). 

Fabinho was slow to close the tackle or get back to cover for Trent. This leaves our remaining back three to cover the width of the pitch as City play a pass. Henderson doesn't drop into the back four to help either. 

VVD Caught flat footed for the pass - a mistake which happens all the time but results in complete disaster here. Konate also too far covering for Trent to help. Robertson has too much space to cover and can't get there in time. 

[Third Goal](https://imgur.com/prBFg8n). If you can't see two banks of four in here you're lost honestly. 

Fabinho ball watching fails to pick up the deep run and leaves him free for a shot. Rebound falls to a City player for goal. 

[This 4th goal](https://imgur.com/xKRrXXF) is probably the worst one for me. 

We see here a nice 4-4-2 organized shape from us with Gakpo Left, Ox right and Nunez/Firmino up front, but for some reason [Gakpo leaves it to go press the City rb/rcb.] (https://imgur.com/6MCpeWR) Gundogan is in acres of space and neither our DMs nor our strikers are ready to press here. 

He turns and [plays a great pass.](https://imgur.com/lR1t238) 

Now when you see this you know something's already fucked. Trent is in a 2 on 1 vs Mahrez and Grealish and the back four is wrongly positioned. Probably squeezing that half of the pitch to press, but there was no press? 

The closest midfielders to help are Ox and Fabinho. Ox does not bust a run to get back. Fuck knows why. Fabinho is way too casual here or maybe he just can't run, he doesn't burst into full speed until it's way too late. 

Trent gets caught [flat footed on the two on one.](https://imgur.com/E8YubqA) It's not his fault. Ox is showing zero urgency at this point to help him out. Konate makes a heroic effort to close to distance. 

When the [goal happens](https://imgur.com/yjYLHDE), Konate somehow gets near the ball. Trent is sleeping and ball watching as Grealish scores. Ox has managed to fall behind Fabinho and has no idea what on earth is going on. Lost the entire play. 

Fabinho bursts into a late sprint and but way too late. 

Poor from Trent but our midfield failed to back him up in a 2 on 1, nor cover for Konate when Konate tried to compensate. Just absolute clownery. Just also realized the midfield also failed to cut out the pass nor pressure the man with the pass. Is it any wonder that even VVD is struggling here? 

But please don't fucking tell me Klopp and his 4-3-3 addiction. That's just fucking absurd. We're failing to press, and when we can't press the only other way is to sit and counter, which Klopp you could say is a bit of an idealist to not do against the likes of City, but you think West Ham/Everton are going to be 3 points if we're sitting deep and hitting them on the break?

Edit: Wanted this to be a more simple post but ended up taking a deeper look at the goals I guess. Our midfield just sold out our defense at so many points in the game it's upsetting. The Athletic article points out how City definitely made it difficult for our team with spare men, City's technical ability etc but skims over how poor our midfielders were. The gist of it is that they defeated our press with clever positioning (granted my understanding of pressing triggers and structures isn't the best) and played it out to Grealish/KDB who made it hard for Fabinho/Henderson to pick them up by positioning wider of the double pivot. 

What I do know is what goes next. Plugging gaps, covering spaces and the like. Fabinho and Henderson were unable to mark Grealish/KDB nor cut out passes to them nor did they contribute effectively to the press. They could have covered at RB/CB more often but were often slow to get back/recognize the danger. 

If a player gets beaten on the dribble, that happens all the time in football. Someone must be there to cover for him. If a player gets beaten 2v1, that's even worse, someone has already fucked up for it to get to that point. We saw that multiple times in the game yesterday and our midfield was pedestrian, I doubt Klopp was telling them to do that.",Liverpool,No,jeqpuhl,t3_129amem
"I think we'll be back next season. I trust Klopp and this group too much to think this is the end of our era. We'll sign 2 big midfielders and one homegrown one as well as a Matip replacement.

Maybe we could sign him and Caicedo and use him as the Henderson and Caicedo as the Wijnaldum with Bajcetic as the Fabinho.

He kept these players, called us spoilt when we wanted more. The mentality that runs in this club is horrible. Always the fkn underdogs, never there to grip a game by the balls and WIN like the top clubs. That underdog shit theme ran through Ljinders book, who told us that an FA/Carabao cup epitomises this team. What kind of mindset is that? So, so much sentiment. Wanted to keep Firmino, 4 years for Henderson. Probably would‚Äôve kept a declining Mane. He churns out disgusting results with the knowledge that nothing will happen to him.

"Truth be told I‚Äôm as nearly worried about our attack as I am some of the other positions. Salah is on outrageous wages and isn‚Äôt producing regularly enough to really be worth that, plus is over 30 and clearly not in his prime anymore. 

Nunez has good potential but I also think using him on the wing is madness. He doesn‚Äôt have the technical ability required for the role and nearly every time against the bus goes missing. He played up front vs Southampton and that was one of his best games for us. I will also add he is very much not the finished product which we really do need sooner rather than later.

Gakpo looks to have quality and needs more time to settle into the role but again his best position appears to be central which completely negates Nunez. 

Jota played alright yesterday but still didn‚Äôt make any big impact which has been the case for a long time now. 

Diaz is quality and someone I can‚Äôt wait to see back in the team but even he is a left winger, meaning Nunez should go back to striker but then where does Gakpo play? Yes we can rotate but it feels odd planning imo. 

My biggest gripe is our main success came from tricky, pacey wingers with good technical ability who can produce something from nothing and I really worry we are risking losing this with our recent strategy. I don‚Äôt feel Jota offers enough different to the others either for him to be much use for us. For me, while he‚Äôs a decent player, we should be looking to replace him for a young, pacey winger with big potential who can hopefully compete with and take over from Salah in a couple of years.

If he‚Äôs keen. And we all know Klopp wants him badly. Surely we can‚Äôt pull out now. I get we need other players bur we need Jude,Liverpool,Yes,jeq1arl,t1_jeq0x10
"The issue started in 2019 when we did not sign anyone after winning the champions league. It was widely reported that Klopp was happy with the squad and did not need anyone. Only players who‚Äôve left were the ones who wanted to leave us. Klopp doesn‚Äôt sell anyone. Ox and Keita should‚Äôve been long gone. Milner keeps getting extensions. Klopp insisted on Henderson‚Äôs new contract which made him one of the highest earners when he was declining. 

We have spent 180 million in the last three windows on forwards while nothing on midfielders. I‚Äôm not sure how much truth there but it was reported that he even wanted to extend Firmino. A lot of this mess is due to Klopp‚Äôs loyalty.",Liverpool,Yes,jemrfq1,t1_jemqhek
"While I think this is definitely the case, I still feel like, if we completely revamp the midfield, we'll be able to fight for third/second place, at least.

Like, literally, we have been playing without a midfield for the whole season and we're still fighting for top 4. The defence doesn't do much either these days, but still, we're in the competition

A complete overhaul of the midfield is not enough, but it's a start. Then there's the Winter window, and the summer after that. 

But of course, this depends on Fsg and Klopp too. Because if Klopp watches yesterday's game and says that Fab and Hendo were good, then yes, we're fucked",Liverpool,Yes,jemrfd9,t1_jemqhek
"I don't completely disagree but I will say that the belief around the squad is at rock bottom and it's difficult to know who's suffering from a lack of confidence in his teammates around him and who is actually just finished at this level.

That to me is Klopps biggest job this summer, figuring out who is who. Who will still have the desire and fight in them if we can repopulate the midfield with capable players. I'm hoping the likes of Vigil, Trent, Fabinho and Gomez are in that category. But my suspicion is that Henderson, Matip, Ox and Keita are past the stage of being effective for us anymore. The latter two leaving anyway, obviously.

Maybe I've got that split wrong, basing it mainly on age if nothing else. But I have to believe that some of the world class talent in this squad haven't lost it completely, they are simply suffering from a chronic loss in confidence, both in themselves and their teammates.

I'm not saying a new midfield fixes all of this, but i think we will be shocked by just how much it helps. We have let that area stagnate for years now.",Liverpool,Yes,jemrj47,t1_jemqhek
"This team is finished. It has been since final whistle of CL final last year.

It needs wholesale surgery. Probably impossible to do that in 1 window, so be prepared for a few seasons of building.

We've got good young players up top. But the midfield and defence need refreshed almost in totality

Arguably, we absolutely need a few new gameplans too as the tried and tested isn't working",Liverpool,Yes,jemyqp9,t1_jemqhek
"I agree.

People here clinging to the hope that Bellingham will magically transform this team, and that Fabinho will rediscover his form next season are in for a rude awakening.

Our entire midfield needs a revamp.

Fabinho is past it. He‚Äôs played poorly all season, and he‚Äôll be 30 next season. Players just don‚Äôt ‚Äúfind their form‚Äù at 30. They decline, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening to Fabinho.

Henderson‚Äôs been past it for a while now. Excellent leadership, and the occasional strong performance, but just not good enough to be starting regularly anymore.

Elliott has flashes of brilliance, but he‚Äôs a huge defensive liability, and it‚Äôs extremely apparent that he just can‚Äôt work on that same side as Trent. He doesn‚Äôt really fit. He‚Äôs too defensively weak in midfield, and he doesn‚Äôt have the pace for a forward. He‚Äôs young, so can improve, but we can‚Äôt afford to pin our hopes on a young player reaching the level we require at some point in the future.

Carvalho has apparently shat in Klopp‚Äôs cereal. No, but seriously, I genuinely have no idea why he doesn‚Äôt play. I‚Äôve seen people say it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs ‚Äúbullied off the ball‚Äù too easily, but most of our midfield have been out there dropping stinkers every week, and they still get game time. Fabinho has been genuinely *shocking*, and he still plays regularly. Even Curtis Jones or Ox make a cameo every now and then, so it‚Äôs odd that Klopp has such little faith in Carvalho. Either way, a player the manager doesn‚Äôt trust to play isn‚Äôt particularly useful to us.

Curtis Jones just isn‚Äôt good enough. He isn‚Äôt outright terrible, but he isn‚Äôt good enough for a team that should be challenging for the title and going for the champions league. Perhaps he will improve, as he‚Äôs young, but I‚Äôve yet to see any evidence of that happening.

Then there‚Äôs Thiago. Absolutely world class player, and I‚Äôd argue the most talented player in our squad. Most matches I think he‚Äôs the very best player on the pitch.
But he‚Äôs 31. He‚Äôll be 32 next month. Pinning our hopes on an injury prone 32 year old is absolutely nuts. 

Ox, Keita, and probably Milner are all gone.

Bajetic‚Äôs got potential, but he‚Äôs 18, and he‚Äôs new, and he‚Äôll be coming back from a long term injury next season. Too early to make the call on his future.

So‚Ä¶where does that leave us? We have *at best* some decent rotational options. We don‚Äôt have anything close to what should be a regular starting midfield. We need, as you say, 5+ midfielders. If we blow all our money on Jude Bellingham, we aren‚Äôt going to be in much of a different situation next season to what we are now. Even if he genuinely does transform the team, what happens when he gets injured, and he‚Äôs out for a month or two? We go back to this? 

We need way more.

And that‚Äôs just midfield. Defence is an utter mess right now. Trent‚Äôs been shaky, Robertson‚Äôs not been himself, Van Dijk is struggling, and again, will be 32 next season. Matip‚Äôs going. Gomez has been poor. 

Even Salah‚Äôs going to be 31 next season. He won‚Äôt keep performing miracles forever.

We‚Äôre so far from just needing Jude Bellingham, it‚Äôs genuinely worrying. I absolutely do not see us bouncing back to being world class next season. It‚Äôs going to take a few transfer windows to fix this. My biggest concern is that I just don‚Äôt see us strengthening anywhere near as much as we should, even over the course of a few windows.

Not sure what happens next, but I fear this is too big a transition for Klopp and FSG to make.",Liverpool,Yes,jen1v2y,t1_jemqhek
I‚Äôd read it all,Liverpool,Yes,jemur5h,t1_jemqhek
"I'm a bit more circumspect about this. I think VVD will instantly look better behind a good DM. We absolutely do need a new CB though and that lad on a free sounds like good business. But agree that our midfield is almost entirely useless, Bajcetic aside and accounting for Thiago being half a (very good) player given his fitness. But yeah, I think we need 5-6 players in too. We've left ourselves a full rebuild to do with no CL to attract players. That VVD quote is really telling and it's been two years in a row he's said it - the players don't think we're committed as a club and it's galling. No wonder they don't look arsed. The club certainly isn't.",Liverpool,Yes,jen7rf9,t1_jemqhek
"Do you honestly think we would have spent if we won prem and CL? We would have gotten the same bollocks, even more convincing that the team is still good enough...

I firmly believe Klopp will go before FSG do, whether of his own volition (unlikely) or the fanbase turning on him (you're already seeing it in this post and it'll only get worse after we underinvest this summer again). The owners are going to leech off this club for a decade more with occasional minority sales to monetize and buy sports franchises in the US. I don't give our fanbase enough credit to correctly identify the issues, and it's going to be miserable watching us after Klopp leaves when the gobshites in our fanbase will realize how much he did with how little on a net basis, and how his 'lack of ruthlessness' was really just trying to get the most out of what he had on a relative shoestring given he's never allowed to have a transfer fail.",Liverpool,Yes,jen99fu,t1_jemoqbo

I mean yea his body language has been atrocious but if you're facing players like Vini, Mitoma, Grealish, he should be sticking to them like glue and not focus on having to do all the other things on the pitch.

So many times the opposition have 2, sometimes 3 players in our right back area, and there is literally nothing Trent can do because wherever he goes, they take the other option.

They could lose all 3 and still have a great chance of winning the title though. City aren‚Äôt as consistent this year and have the champions league distraction. Can‚Äôt see them winning every game.,Liverpool,Yes,jeoxvzz,t1_jeoxip8
"I think you‚Äôre forgetting that Gini was pretty terrible in his final season.

"No, he'll never get a big club again. He'll bounce around mid/bottom sides.",Liverpool,Yes,jenq2m4,t1_jenppse
"I could see him at a West Ham or a Palace. He would probably do alright at Tottenham. He‚Äôd be able to build a good, young team and get them playing decent football, but they‚Äôd for sure be the biggest bottlejobs in football history.",Liverpool,Yes,jenr1so,t1_jenppse
Why won't Spurs go for him? If they don't get Nagelsmann it's either Poch or Rodgers,Liverpool,Yes,jenrjbk,t1_jenppse
"It amazes me how shit Spurs are, yet they still attract top managers. On paper, they'd be lucky to get Rodgers.",Liverpool,Yes,jens0fc,t1_jenppse
Don't think you can really critique his work in the transfer market given his restricted ability to spend,Liverpool,Yes,jenvwwz,t1_jenppse
"The frustrating thing is that we neither press nor cover. I just made a post about this. 

You can see in another moment when Trent is caught upfield we're completely sold with the midfield neither cutting out the pass, nor coming in at right back or centre back.

The 4th goal in particular saw us concede because Gakpo pressed alone and Gundogan was left free to play a beautiful pass, while the rest of our midfield were statues and failed to help Trent out in a 2v1.",Liverpool,Yes,jeqq8c3,t1_jeq2ema
"Fabinho, Matip, Gomez, Henderson, Keita, Ox are all done and should be moved on

Virgil is also done as world class player. He can still find some form IF we bring in the right reinforcements but he is not returning to the level he once was. Calling out the lack of investment but being a complete clown on the pitch is not the right mentality.

Trent is done as a defender. Move him higher up the pitch and remove him from the backline.",Liverpool,Yes,jen65tq,t1_jen4q4j
"Fabinho is just as bad as a traffic cone these days, incredible how you were downvoted",Liverpool,Yes,jen5c43,t1_jen4q4j
They have no room to talk when they've lost to City twice already this season lol,Liverpool,Yes,jenp9jm,t1_jenm0we

They're also right on both Van Dijk and our mentality these days.",Liverpool,Yes,jenmhvu,t1_jenm0we
Maybe they should beat City when they play them.,Liverpool,Yes,jenmbwc,t1_jenm0we
No CL would affect us in terms of player recruitment not money because we would still make money from this year's CL to spend in the summer.,Liverpool,Yes,jeomqlp,t1_jeolupz
"I think mudryk is decent, looked quality for shakhtar. Think the issue is just how many players they signed, and potter being manager. Getting rid of tuchel is criminal",Liverpool,Yes,jepzacx,t1_jepm3ef

You're right though,  there's deffo an argument for just going back to business and tightening things up",Liverpool,Yes,jenoeem,t1_jenne5x
"Klopp literally said on Friday ""we will definitely spend"" so he either knows some deals are already agreed or has been assured of his budget


So to say Klopp won't get ANY of his targets is nonsense sensationalism",Liverpool,Yes,jemz3qa,t1_jemy09b
"Liverpool had money to spend but klopp decided to stay with this team, klopp literally admitted as much‚Ä¶.

We aren‚Äôt back to being a yo-yo team, we are just having a bad season because the players are fucked.

Look at the two sides in the premier league that played the most games, want to guess which they were? Liverpool and Chelsea.

Is it coincidence that arsenal, a side without Europe and a terrible season last year are top?lol 

I swear the sky is falling attitude on this sub after losing is hilarious.",Liverpool,Yes,jen1tij,t1_jemy09b
"Oh we need to stop doing this, we need to. It is not just FSG. Read! Klopp declines scouts options! He goes against data analytics. He doesn‚Äôt get the second choices when they‚Äôre still good players who would have helped us get top 4 this season. Do ppl on Reddit live in another world because this is common information on twit? Klopp said what kind of a midfielder do we need last summer ???? He thought this team was fine to push on after missing tchoumani, he SAID IT.",Liverpool,Yes,jemzrr4,t1_jemy09b
Imagine you put your best in for years challenging for everything then players like Ox and Keita who don't care and don't press are your subs which means our first team players get worn down and play like 30k minutes in a few seasons. Klopp lacks the ruthlessness and financial backing of Pep it will be hard to compete.,Liverpool,Yes,jen1ffk,t1_jemy09b
The conference league definitely but there is nothing wrong with playing europa league as it gives us another way to qualify for CL if we win,Liverpool,Yes,jeoharf,t1_jeoh2co
Hyypia was captain for a year and was replaced by a local player. Taking it away from Hendo would be taken completely differently.,Liverpool,Yes,jenjcfp,t1_jenj3s4
"Why doesn't Salah get a mention any time for the captaincy role. The man gives it all on the pitch and is a positive role model if you are looking at one. 

I would rather give it to salah or Robbo over Ali. I just don't like the goal keeper having the armband.",Liverpool,Yes,jenjxm4,t1_jenj3s4
"Hyypia wasn't captain material at the time, for all of Hendo's faults his leadership has never been one.",Liverpool,Yes,jens86f,t1_jenj3s4
VVD and Robbo next in line not that Jurgen is ruthless enough to do it.,Liverpool,Yes,jenj9ii,t1_jenj3s4
I think the VAR ref sees it as a new game situation.,Liverpool,Yes,jen39bc,t1_jen2y63
"Right now we don't have midfielders creative enough to play a possession based game, any team would just sit back and counter and we'd be stumped as we've seen numerous times this season",Liverpool,Yes,jeng0ry,t1_jene9v6

Solanke looked like a world world beater against us it‚Äôs not hard at this point,Liverpool,Yes,jeo7s5z,t1_jeo63gb
He may go on to be a really good player but spending 100m on him based on what he‚Äôs done so far in his career is still insanity. Can‚Äôt wrap my head around it at all,Liverpool,Yes,jeoaveo,t1_jeo63gb
I mean in first meetup everyone started claiming he's the new Hazard,Liverpool,Yes,jeo8rtf,t1_jeo63gb
"Then who chooses to keep the players then? Fsg? Who want to extend Milner Bobby contract? Who pushed the contract for Henderson? Who want to keep Ox Keita Jones and not playing them, not sell them?",Liverpool,Yes,jeqrh1v,t1_jeqpuhl
If you put it like that then the manager is NEVER and I mean NEVER at fault because he is not the one kicking the ball and making mistakes on the field.,Liverpool,Yes,jevmfir,t1_jeqpuhl
We can't seriously be starting Fabinho next year.,Liverpool,Yes,jeos4hg,t1_jeomdj2
No chance Fsg sanctions Bellingham and Caicedo in the same window.,Liverpool,Yes,jeouui2,t1_jeomdj2

I could see us going for maybe one of them, but both in one window, 0 chance",Liverpool,Yes,jeon0jn,t1_jeomdj2
"That front three isn‚Äôt good enough for that. Far too inconsistent and not well suited to our style. Diaz coming back and picking up where he left off is our best hope of having a top class frontline again.

[deleted],Liverpool,Yes,jenlrla,t1_jenl6q1

shit take,Liverpool,Yes,jeoehue,t1_jeodwof
"100% this. Got a buncha bullshit online for saying the same thing. All he's done is figure out what a stubborn Ole couldnt: get rid of McFred and slabhead and put in competent replacements that aren't absolutely muppets and you'll be fine. You dont have to be SAF to figure that out. Other than that, it's the same 4231 counter attack set up Ole had already.",Liverpool,Yes,jeohouo,t1_jeodwof
"United look shit without Casemiro. Newcastle look incredible with Bruno Guimaraes. A world class midfielder can completely change a team, Jude has the potential to be one of the greats of the game so we HAVE to go all out for him",Liverpool,Yes,jeolwzi,t1_jeokxmn
You watched that newscastle game and didn‚Äôt notice how much better they ate with bruno back ‚Ä¶.,Liverpool,Yes,jeol5bo,t1_jeokxmn
I just want to see him sold tbf,Liverpool,Yes,jen7syt,t1_jen7osp
"Yes, he‚Äôs a good rb; that fits his strengths and is his natural position. I‚Äôd rather we lost Trent‚Äôs creativity, had more solidity in the back and tried to score on the counter. They wouldn‚Äôt be able attack the right every game, at least.",Liverpool,Yes,jenkqka,t1_jen7osp
He shouldn‚Äôt play in a Liverpool shirt again. Gone this summer.,Liverpool,Yes,jen7ray,t1_jen7osp
I'm in this camp as well. Anyone who's actually played football realizes how much easier your job is as a back four with a DM mopping up danger early and a midfield that can hold onto the ball / control the tempo.,Liverpool,Yes,jeng7qc,t1_jen7tbq
"I've been surprised by the inability of our coaching staff to minimize the obvious weaknesses in our play.

Of course it doesn't matter how good your coaching staff are, with our midfield there would always be a low ceiling for what is achievable. But it's so shocking how we just set up the exact same way every game.

Jurgenand pep have had a shocking season.",Liverpool,Yes,jen9d06,t1_jen7tbq
Yup. Any defense will be under constant pressure if they keep getting exposed so easily.,Liverpool,Yes,jenjfff,t1_jen7tbq
"The defence has been consistently have an absolute mare, but I'd agree that the midfield has obviously been our downfall this season; it offers little to no protection to the defence, and minimal support to the strikers",Liverpool,Yes,jen8q7a,t1_jen7tbq
"Bellingham is nothing like Zidane lol, what are you watching ? Zidane was a technical wizard who could do tricks, flicks and control the game. He could play anywhere across the midfield and on the wings and as an attacking midfielder. 

Bellingham doesn't possess his technical power, hell he isn't even comparable to Inesta. He is built in more of a Micheal ballack mode type of player.",Liverpool,Yes,jenkeid,t1_jenbr2w
He just won't. Simple as that.,Liverpool,Yes,jeng01g,t1_jeneytb
"We aren't pressing that intensely anyway, and do people really expect us to drop pressing entirely and play like a Big Sam side overnight? This simply isn't how modern football coaching works.",Liverpool,Yes,jenihid,t1_jeneytb
"What can he realistically change except a few personnel?  Changing the formation is pointless with these players and it's not like we are pressing intensely. Yesterday we were playing counter attacking formation which backfired, it was always going to happen against a top quality side.",Liverpool,Yes,jeni684,t1_jeneytb
What's the difference between Naglesmann and potter? Both are flavours of the month unproven at the highest level.,Liverpool,Yes,jep2ap4,t1_jep05x6

That will be hilarious if that happens. Please make it happen.,Liverpool,Yes,jep22kn,t1_jep1vvb
"I think Mount is going to be quite difficult. Chelsea need to sell players, but they have plenty of others they can sell before him. And he counts as home grown for them. The 70m price is of course ridiculous but they‚Äôll be able to hold firm around 50. I actually think we‚Äôre gonna miss on Jude and go all in for mount which will send this sub into meltdown.",Liverpool,Yes,jepig4k,t1_jepe8y2
"I've said this before but if we want a rb who prioritises defending over attacking, we need someone other than trent there. Trent is best at attacking, but needs someone in midfield to protect him. If the midfield isn't doing that then he will be caught out.

"What's the chances of this Chelsea side turning up against us... And Kante is back, who always plays good against us",Liverpool,Yes,jenghcc,t1_jen6643
Lmaooooo a break. World cup isn't enough of a break? International breaks aren't enough for breaks? Wake up,Liverpool,Yes,jenhle5,t1_jenh3a4
"Not exaggerating when I say there‚Äôs no point of even having a midfield if you‚Äôre going to have a pivot of Hendo and Fab. We‚Äôd be better off just fielding Firmino and Carvalho in attack instead, you‚Äôd see no difference",Liverpool,Yes,jenhm5h,t1_jenh3a4
Don't think it really matters. I wouldn't be confident of this team beating Chelsea anyways even if Potter stayed.,Liverpool,Yes,jep44ge,t1_jep3txw
"What? 315 mil since last season is ""not spending big""?",Liverpool,Yes,jeouot3,t1_jeoqzdj
They haven't sold anyone of value and have spent 300 mill plus but I get your point they will keep spending big while we will pretend poverty.,Liverpool,Yes,jeovg51,t1_jeoqzdj
"People who say change the formation of change this or change that have never played football and it shows. 

If your engine is broken down nothing will work. Formations don't mean shit these days. It's all about the personnel. When you don't have reliable players, change all you want it's not gonna do anything.",Liverpool,Yes,jepbldf,t1_jepb6rb
"Its embarrassing on here so called fans destroying the players and manager when we get beat,  can't comprehend the fact that on the day they came up against a better team and better manager, no amount of attitude or tactics would've made a difference",Liverpool,Yes,jepqxny,t1_jepb6rb
"Had some simpleton like that where he replied to my comment calling him out referring to himself in third person 
Weirdos and cowards also 
Not worth it talking to them. When it comes to it they are weak and don‚Äôt stand by their convictions",Liverpool,Yes,jeplevl,t1_jepb6rb

"Nah, he will want to try and right this wrong with some new players next season. If next season doesn't go significantly better then he might walk",Liverpool,Yes,jemtesl,t1_jemri0e
"Well he keeps saying he knows what to do and what changes to make yet we are constantly making the same mistakes and approaching every game the same, so I can‚Äôt be surprised some are losing faith in him",Liverpool,Yes,jen6hkl,t1_jen579w
"Lets be honest, he isnt making any tactical tweaks. He has been failed by the players multiple times this year, but sticking to the exact same dross system week in and week out when this squad is not fit to play it is on him.",Liverpool,Yes,jen5g8e,t1_jen579w
"Not to mention, if the personnel just aren't there, there's only so much you can do. Does become a case of just riding out the season honestly.",Liverpool,Yes,jennzb2,t1_jen579w
"You've been downvoted but I largely agree, if only because we'd get a decent fee for him and I don't really think he's defensively minded enough to play CM and quick or lethal enough to rotate with our forwards. He'd be well suited to other sides in the league.",Liverpool,Yes,jenicjz,t1_jenfz26
"He has the home-grown factor and age/potential on his side plus the coaches trust.

However I dont see his place in this system. No pace to play on the right wing (and isnt good enough in general to be the direct salah backup). He cannot play as a central midfielder either. In an ideal world we bring in 3 or new midfielders this summer that will send Elliot away down the depth chart too so he will never develop to the required level if thats even possible",Liverpool,Yes,jenih7q,t1_jenfz26
"Disagree, I think people are being too harsh on him. He‚Äôs 19 years old and has played every game for us in a dysfunctional team, of course he‚Äôs going to look bad. Yes he shouldn‚Äôt be starting but our shitty midfield situation has meant that he‚Äôs had to because there‚Äôs no one else better. You can‚Äôt expect every 19 year old to be a complete midfielder when he isn‚Äôt even a natural midfielder. I‚Äôd get rid of Fab, Hendo, Jones and Carvalho before I‚Äôd consider selling Elliot",Liverpool,Yes,jenhg16,t1_jenfz26
"He‚Äôs not good enough. Even as a right winger, I don‚Äôt see him anywhere near the level it takes to warrant this much game time at a top six club. Players like Foden and Saka were much better than him at the same age. 

I‚Äôm not even going to comment on the defensive side of his game because we all know his limitations there. He‚Äôs in the team for his offensive qualities, but like, what are they? He‚Äôs far too one-footed to play midfield, his stats are apparently decent but watching him, it seems like he always chooses the safe option on the ball. He isn‚Äôt quick, skillfull or even bold enough to take on a man. He rarely makes incisive passes that split the defence. He‚Äôs a Rodgers era player who‚Äôs neat and tidy on the ball with no impetus to his game. Not sure what Klopp sees in him",Liverpool,Yes,jenmlzy,t1_jenfz26
"There‚Äôs no chance we sell him but I do agree, he might succeed in a different setup but he just isn‚Äôt right for us.",Liverpool,Yes,jenghma,t1_jenfz26
I think it‚Äôs a known fact that Pep is the better tactician,Liverpool,Yes,jeovo6a,t1_jeouxrs
"> J√ºrgen Klopp *paid* the team

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*",Liverpool,Yes,jeouyr3,t1_jeouxrs
We won‚Äôt have any defenders playing if we‚Äôre doing that,Liverpool,Yes,jenccpp,t1_jen73ql

"We are not in the hunt for top 4. Looking forward to the summer when we‚Äôve underachieved, can‚Äôt attract the right players and then we‚Äôll be reading looking forward to the Conference League, I think we can really give it a go this year.",Liverpool,Yes,jen4xdg,t1_jemucnx
"I don't really ever expect to go to City and win, but even with that yesterday sucked.

But I agree with you, onto Chelsea, lets get serious about top 4. I also think we will have a big summer and be back challenging for the title next season. I don't have time for all the miserable gloomy shit in here.",Liverpool,Yes,jemygk8,t1_jemucnx
"KloppOut is dripping off this post, so that's what i'll debate.

I won't even get into the obvious matter of Klopp having earned our patience tenfold, because everyone here should know exactly why we're so loyal to the man without needing a written explanation. 

So i'll get into the more practical matters:

1. Klopp is at worst a Top 2 coach in world football. Whoever we'd replace him with would be a downgrade, regardless of where he finishes this season.

2. I see no signs that he's lost the dressing room, which would obviously be an issue because any club will let the coach go before they would the players - especially FSG who would hardly buy him a new squad.

3. If he really is the man at fault for us not signing a midfielder or two so far, i'm certain he's realized his mistake about 7 months ago. He's been going on about the summer window for weeks, so he obviously knows a rebuild is needed, and fast.",Liverpool,Yes,jen0zo7,t1_jemznto
"I have contrasting views on this, on the one hand, I know and accept that klopp isn‚Äôt perfect, it‚Äôs not what makes him so relatable to us as a club, we aren‚Äôt perfect, we don‚Äôt expect perfection and I wouldn‚Äôt swap city/pep‚Äôs perfect way of playing and winning multiple leagues for what we‚Äôve had under Klopp, we are the plucky underdogs and I‚Äôm ok with that BUT what we are seeing this season isn‚Äôt simply imperfection, it‚Äôs out right mediocre, spurs are having a poor season so much so they‚Äôve sacked two managers already in one season and yet they are currently sat 4th, we are sat mid table with only 10 games to go, regardless of midfield issues that‚Äôs simply not good enough, Chelsea, who‚Äôs current manager has the worst win % in the clubs entire history at something like 20% are only 4 points behind us, 1 if they beat us at the bridge on Tuesday. 

Something is wrong with the management of this current team, I watched both Henderson and Konate put in world class performances for their counties last week but when it comes to playing for us? Under our tactical set up they look like Sunday league players. 

I accept Klopp for his imperfections but I simply can‚Äôt accept us not playing to a minimum standard and sitting middle of the table with 10 games to go. It‚Äôs simply not good enough, any other manager in world football would have been sacked by now. 

Am I Klopp out? No probably not, because I‚Äôm as loyal to the bloke as he is his players. Is that a good thing? Probably not? He should probably go just like most of the players but I‚Äôll continue to blindly follow.",Liverpool,Yes,jen129p,t1_jemznto
"There's a reason why Pep remains successful and Klopp has highs and lows, and that reason is budget. Pep can go wrong with his transfers (it's hard to go wrong when you can buy the most expansive player) because he can just supplement the squad with another good player, Klopp can't. Margin of error is infinitesimal for Klopp. It's hard to know for certain what's happening behind the curtains, but it's easy to guess that Klopp's strategy and plans revolve around a meager budget and there's no one else to blame to when shit hits the fans, unlike other coaches. So if the gods of football are unhappy, LFC will suffers the most among top 6. So yes, Klopp had no luck this season, and our squad is plagues with injuries, which in the hindsight could have been replaced or avoided, but that does not mean Klopp is failure and he won't learn from that. He's the one person who can rebuild the squad with nonexistent budget to show another miracle. So it will be very short sighted to get rid of him.",Liverpool,Yes,jen57dz,t1_jemznto
"It's clear that we've become pretty dysfunctional across whole areas at the club. Tbh, other than the team growing our income, I can't think of a sector that has performed well this season. Now, I'm certainly not calling for Klopp to go, but he has to take his share of the blame here. Squad management has been poor for years, mentality has imploded this season, and coaching seems to have gone backwards. These are all things he has major control over. 

I've no doubt we can rebuild, but we are starting again from scratch. Major lessons need to be learned all through the club.",Liverpool,Yes,jen3lxk,t1_jemznto
Please stay on twitter.,Liverpool,Yes,jen0j2e,t1_jemznto
">Truth be told I‚Äôm as nearly worried about our attack as I am some of the other positions. Salah is on outrageous wages and isn‚Äôt producing regularly enough to really be worth that, plus is over 30 and clearly not in his prime anymore. 
 
Stopped reading here. 34 G+A in this side and Salah is your first target for criticism. Our fanbase is clueless.",Liverpool,Yes,jenagzz,t1_jen6tes
"The positional thing is an absolute non issue. Mane was a right winger, then Salah came and he became arguably the second best left winger on the planet, depending what you'd classify Ronaldo position as at that point. Which side forwards play on is far, far less of an issue, and the reality is we have 5 lads for 3 positions. 

Honestly, aside from the goalkeepers, it's by some distance our strongest area.

Give them a functioning midfield and they'll fly.",Liverpool,Yes,jenmy6y,t1_jen6tes

"Tbf, City won the league with 100 points having Otamendi at centre half. It's surprising how good systems can hide player's weaknesses.

"I do feel for trent in a way,  his weakness is being exploited and now it's a bit of a vicious circle. I can't say I'd be thrilled about facing an utter cunt like Grealish of i was in bad form either.

Then tactically it _looks_ like nothing is really being done to address it,  just crack on and hope for the best

Klopp has built up a lot of credit I terms of good will but I find it weird that he can't seem to fashion an even OK team out of our players atm. We genuinely feel one of the weakest teams in the league and our position flatters us, tbh.",Liverpool,Yes,jen63t5,t1_jen47ci
"Exactly the same as what happened in 20/21 when they finished second because everybody else was shite.

Lol even his overall performance wasn't good. The man didn't even tackle when someone took the ball by him.,Liverpool,Yes,jeplkpf,t1_jeph4hb
The biggest threat to our defence is someone getting free down Robertsons side of the pitch. If someone is free we suddenly become so narrow that anyone making a run on Trents side is wide open,Liverpool,Yes,jengfvb,t1_jencloz
When we had Gini it was a non issue. He'd become an auxiliary left back when robbo bombed on. That's just not the player thiago is. Wholeheartedly feel like pretty much every issue we have this season has snowballed from having a midfield with personnel that don't fit the way we try to play.,Liverpool,Yes,jenlmqs,t1_jencloz
Tsimikas hasn't exactly shone when he's had opportunities this season but some of the fringe players should definitely be rotated into the starting IX more often now. Trent could definitely do with a rest too.,Liverpool,Yes,jen0u70,t1_jemytsq
"Mathematically? Sure. But when we lose to Brentford, Brighton, wolves, Nottingham forest, Leeds, and pair that with our away form this season it doesn't really bode confidence. And even without looking at those results, it's the way we lose those games that's a big giveaway.",Liverpool,Yes,jeoobui,t1_jeojo6f
"I hope we will never again have winter world cup, it just isn't right",Liverpool,Yes,jep79ho,t1_jep4zq4
We could beat Chelsea and Arsenal then lose to Leeds‚Ä¶. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me,Liverpool,Yes,jenynjg,t1_jenyijk
"It‚Äôs not impossible but it‚Äôs highly unlikely. Unless Diaz comes in and plays like his old self and Thiago takes hold of every game we play and stays fit, I don‚Äôt see it happening",Liverpool,Yes,jeovhtp,t1_jeour07
They won't. It would be enough for FSG to point to the Qatari ownership through some journo like Pearce and local fans would shut up.,Liverpool,Yes,jep3mm3,t1_jep1ud6
Yeah like he never wanted Tchoumeni last season and Nunes which they let him go to Wolves cause they wanted to reduce debt instead of paying his release clause. This Klopp agenda is so forced.,Liverpool,Yes,jeovcdb,t1_jeoubrk
"And even if Chelsea did play awfully, we specialise in playing like shit against shit teams.",Liverpool,Yes,jen2xge,t1_jemtsb2
I think Nagelsman now probably ends up at Chelsea but he‚Äôs also rumoured to be wanted by Madrid.,Liverpool,Yes,jep5b27,t1_jep54vp
I hope so. But I think a lot has been done mentally this season.,Liverpool,Yes,jen37cm,t1_jemzpx7
I disagree. We look horrendous at the back too and the likes of Trent and Van Dijk are just not at it either. It feels like we‚Äôre lost.,Liverpool,Yes,jen35zm,t1_jen28dq
"Trent isnt producing the same creative output right now due to being pinned back by opposition wingers. It makes more sense to have him in the wide 8 than rightback especially given his current form. This stigma in having our midfielders pressing and retaining the ball is a myth, none of them has shown they are capable of doing so consistently.",Liverpool,Yes,jeoug1k,t1_jeoga13
"I think if you said this 3 years ago I would agree with you. But when we swapped Gini for Thiago I think things changed.

If you matched up Trent and Henderson for the wide 8 role Trent is better. At this point he‚Äôs got more in the tank physically and far better end product.",Liverpool,Yes,jeopck4,t1_jeoga13
I have a suspicion Spurs are not going to have that bounce and lose to Everton tomorrow. I don't think the other teams have it in them to go on a run. Brighton's schedule is tough.,Liverpool,Yes,jeoj3hu,t1_jeoix43
"We just need to accept our fate, the season's a write-off. But we knew that in September.",Liverpool,Yes,jeowlsq,t1_jeow2fi
Feels like 6 years at least.,Liverpool,Yes,jeo3p4n,t1_jenzsvh
"Off the back of this. If he‚Äôs still keen

Who‚Äôs underdog fetish is bigger. Klopps or Jude‚Äôs? üòÇ",Liverpool,Yes,jeq2jan,t1_jeq1arl
"Klopp wanted to extend Keita, Henderson, Milner, Firmino. It's exactly what happened at Dortmund, he had faith in a squad for too long and it just stagnated. 

The fact Ox, Keita, Firmino and possibly Milner are all leaving on a free in the summer just boggles the mind. Origi, Can, Sturridge, Wijnaldum, Lallana, Clyne all leaving on a free previously is annoying too. We've lost out on so much money by not being a bit more proactive and freshening things up.

Thiago being the only midfielder signed since 2018 is absolutely scandalous.",Liverpool,Yes,jemte6b,t1_jemrfq1
"Well said , I mentioned this months ago on here before the 3-0 loss to wolves and I got slaughtered, The will to win is gone and once we let in the first goal which we nearly always do this season, the heads drop .A massive rebuilding is needed Jude Bellingham alone will not be able to carry this team , he‚Äôs not Stevie G.",Liverpool,Yes,jemx7yq,t1_jemrj47
"A rebuild was coming anyways, but by God did that loss in Paris accelerate the need for it.

I'm convinced that if we won that match we'd be in the mix with City and Arsenal right now, at worst we'd be in United's position. That near-quadruple ruined this team, we flew too close to the sun and got burned. And then you add a mid-season World Cup into the mix.",Liverpool,Yes,jen017n,t1_jemyqp9
"I think this season will have left its mark on the ability and confidence of many of these players, even with a strengthened midfield. We didn't just fuck an entire season away, the repercussions will be felt for a while.

Anyone who thinks we'll just roll onto the next season with a couple midfield additions and completely forget this one ever happened is in for a reckoning imo. It will take a few windows to rectify this, and it's not a certainty that we will. Other teams won't sit still waiting for us to catch up.",Liverpool,Yes,jenbqlc,t1_jen7rf9
"Yup been saying this and been getting downvoted for sometime on this. Every game I tune into, I only see United getting lucky. Happened against Leicester as well they were battering them in the first half but couldn't finish, same with wolves. 

You can't keep getting away with these lucky wins. It will even out eventually. Don't know what others see in him as a manager. I also feel he is arrogant the way he came into the league and started talking about ending eras and the way he was talking about anfield.

The guy seems to be full of himself. Has no hubris for a new manager in a new league.",Liverpool,Yes,jeomk6r,t1_jeolz0b
"With Trent I think it's more a mentality problem. He has shown in a few games to be very good, United game comes to mind. But they are few and far apart.",Liverpool,Yes,jeo3soe,t1_jenxwla
"They only appear in the threads FSG apologists all turn up in. There's like one post a month that ends up defending the owners and despite months of inactivity, they somehow all magically appear to show their true support.",Liverpool,Yes,jenr28p,t1_jennnrc
"So pretentious, and then they'll be the kind of people to say you can't use hindsight and we almost won a quadruple so didn't need to buy anyone, when in reality the real fans knew we needed better midfielders from actually watching the matches and then got shit on for saying the truth.",Liverpool,Yes,jenwk10,t1_jenn0rc
They are here just downvoting in silence and seething. Give them a good result and they will come back in full force.,Liverpool,Yes,jenur98,t1_jentp9l
"They‚Äôve been surprisingly quite as of late. 

I‚Äôd almost forgotten what this sub was like. I haven‚Äôt seen ‚Äúgo support city‚Äù, ‚Äúyou wouldn‚Äôt have survived the Roy Hodgson years‚Äù, ‚Äúgive your head a wobble‚Äù, ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt fifa‚Äù, or the word plastic plastered all over the sub in a while.

A year ago it felt like you couldn‚Äôt point out an issue with the club without a hundred people jumping on you and declaring you some fake fan for even daring to criticise.

You could argue that this place is a bit overly negative at the moment, but it really wasn‚Äôt much better when you were lynched for pointing out a flaw either.

It‚Äôs genuinely fascinating just how much this place has changed though.",Liverpool,Yes,jeo34sn,t1_jentp9l
I've made to sure to keep that post saved just so I can post it whenever we have a bad loss. Everyone in that post deserves the see what they wrote and be embarrassed every time.,Liverpool,Yes,jenw2vl,t1_jentp9l
[They made a follow up video in Jan and it was shite. No apology or anything.](https://twitter.com/paddypower/status/1613864029059010560?t=dkKIW0yTAoqt7BNIjZFvJA&s=19),Liverpool,Yes,jennifl,t1_jenmhfk
A shitload of money won't change anything. Chelsea spent more than the entirety of La Liga in January,Liverpool,Yes,jenhwyy,t1_jenhr3c
He had one cross and hit the bar. Give him the cross and inshallah service and he‚Äôll be grand.,Liverpool,Yes,jeo0umw,t1_jenzxnm
Tottenham 1 game more played tho,Liverpool,Yes,jeokcy2,t1_jeok9s9
Long may it continue,Liverpool,Yes,jeokb4z,t1_jeok5pi
I recall that and speculation for why we have such a high staff turnover. How true that is or not is debatable for us. But facts that we have is that our players are seriously out of sorts and the number of injuries is ridiculously high. The approach needs to change,Liverpool,Yes,jenmg8j,t1_jenlkqh
Sturridge was permacrocked long before Klopp turned up.,Liverpool,Yes,jent3sf,t1_jenlkqh
">They couldn't afford to sack him. They must have been hoping that they would survive the year and not have to do it.

It's a mutual termination so money has definitely exchanged hands. Looks like Leicester owners are over their money issues.


>But getting relegated would fuck them harder than paying him out so I guess they were forced to.

I agree things did go stale.",Liverpool,Yes,jenrdzd,t1_jenqmwu
Won't that be a downgrade for him.,Liverpool,Yes,jenrhyz,t1_jenqig5
The VAR & Ref combo was appalling.,Liverpool,Yes,jemsg5o,t1_jems76v
Same to me. I could be wrong but in our goal they made a big deal of the check even after it was fairly clear that Jota was played on side. I don‚Äôt mind that but then do the same for them. But the whole broadcast just ignored it.,Liverpool,Yes,jemsnch,t1_jems76v
"Hendo isn't press resistant, fast, or blessed with dribbling ability either. I think Trent would be used in the Kimmich mode.

""he gets in a fullback position and would be a liability on the counter attack."" - this really emphasises the extent of the problem with Trent, a fullback who isn't trusted to cover at fullback. He'd have to learn ...",Liverpool,Yes,jenk9o7,t1_jenjas7
"Have people downvoting me saying this earlier 
We have two oil clubs,Chelsea who spend like an oil club and even spurs outspend us 
We‚Äôre below Brentford and Brighton and deserve to be in 8th if not lower because of alisson",Liverpool,Yes,jeolx90,t1_jeokw4o
"He was coming out in January saying we have to be careful we don‚Äôt make too many signings lol he had zero control there. Highly unlikely he was involved in the Mount negotiations 

Chelsea are going to have to pay Potter alot of money now which only further adds to their needs of getting money for players in the summer",Liverpool,Yes,jep1djt,t1_jep0xz7
No I don‚Äôt mind Trent starting position being RB. Most teams have gone to having conservative full backs now. City plays with 4 centre backs. Full backs get more involved higher up. The width is provided by their midfielders. Considering Trents passing range we can definitely try that.,Liverpool,Yes,jemyvs7,t1_jemy87a
What are you on about? He has a terrible left foot.,Liverpool,Yes,jemyr3m,t1_jemy87a
"Robbo was awful. Too much celebrating beating Spain IMO.

I'm bemused by the lot of em to be honest.

Prides gone completely out of the window.",Liverpool,Yes,jencv36,t1_jenaej2
"Most of his best defensive performances have come with a midfielder acting as a second right back alongside him. Either oxlade-chamberlain or henderson at their fittest were there covering him. Anyone could easily see that's what he needed, the coaches themselves knew that was needed. 

It's incredible they've seemingly deliberately left him stranded with these tactics and still insist on it when he gets strolled past 10 times a game",Liverpool,Yes,jenalmz,t1_jen9gas
Agreed.,Liverpool,Yes,jeogn7f,t1_jeog7o3
"Yea i guess you're right. But we are expected to buy players that are relativly well know, and while i do want Bellingham its kind of insane that we are expected to splash out 120m+ on one player when we are in the state we're in.




I just want another robertson signing lol.",Liverpool,Yes,jeodv5k,t1_jeod06s
"I don't see them getting past Real Madrid.  Don't see them losing against them by as many as we did though.  Never know they won the champions league when they had poor league campaigns. 

Unlucky getting 15 points in the group stage and still finishing 2nd.  If we had've conceded 1 less against Napoli or scored another at Anfield we'd be on their side of the draw.",Liverpool,Yes,jenzjdl,t1_jenyypw
I hope Madrid batter them,Liverpool,Yes,jeo1qlk,t1_jenyypw
"Don't forget grooming their followers to fall in line with an underdog fetish.

Sad to watch fan channels devolve into begging for scraps of inside access to media. Even worse when they act holier than thou for being absolute sellouts.",Liverpool,Yes,jenqd5a,t1_jeng2db
City are winning out. Mark it down.,Liverpool,Yes,jep1jem,t1_jeoxvzz
"Was he pretty terrible or was he run down? Cause he was benched and came back to form as soon as he got some rest and was crucial in the push for the top four. 

But letting him go wasn't the issue not replacing him was. For sure.",Liverpool,Yes,jep7rm0,t1_jep6ro7
"Oh I'm sorry but I just can't stand Gini slander. He was never a problem. That last season he played every minute while everyone else was missing at least two months and we still got top 4 which might not be the case this season, And we had 0 center backs for 3/4 of it.

Some games we were dire and it was easy to point at him since he was not creating, but that was not on him. Never his role. And with him we never looked half as bad as what we have this season.",Liverpool,Yes,jep8flo,t1_jep6ro7
difference is we know this is a disaster season and they think theyre good now,Liverpool,Yes,jeovhqd,t1_jeoskrj
"They were literally claiming to be tittle challengers, so slight difference",Liverpool,Yes,jeoxyqw,t1_jeoskrj
"Kompany, Frank, Enrique, De Zerbi. Plenty of options on the market.",Liverpool,Yes,jenue3v,t1_jenrjbk
It's cause of the salary they can offer.,Liverpool,Yes,jensbgi,t1_jens0fc
"Yeah, we did the same because Arsenal were actually a shit team with no priors. 
What ?

Arsenal fans are saying we have shit mentality, always has been. What nonsense. We have a major dip in squad quality this season. But that doesn‚Äôt mean we had shit mentality all these years and it also doesn‚Äôt mean Liverpool‚Äôs time is over. As long as Klopp is here, he can and will rebuild the team again. And not a major rebuild required. Need to plugin gaps. 

Also, Van Djik has dropped off don‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs overrated. The man was best defender for 2-3 years. He‚Äôs dropped off, not overrated.",Liverpool,Yes,jenvc3o,t1_jenmhvu
"Mudryk is overrated, he doesn't have that many apps or goal contributions to justify that price tag and Chelsea fell for the highlight reels compilation (plus wanted to beat Arsenal for him).",Liverpool,Yes,jeq2lqe,t1_jepzacx
No CL means Jude or Mount can reject us?  Even last summer at our peak we couldn't get players. Fsg lied to Klopp on his rebuilt funds last summer. That's why they wanted to sell to raise funds.,Liverpool,Yes,jen0i5a,t1_jemz3qa
"> Liverpool had money to spend but klopp decided to stay with this team, klopp literally admitted as much

People really believe this shit... incredible

Like yea FSG said ""we gave Klopp 300m but he didnt want it""",Liverpool,Yes,jen3x95,t1_jen1tij
"""Liverpool have the money to spend"" - The owners just want to spend 'responsibly - John Henry has said it as much Plus their history with us shows it. PLUS PLUS they are also doing this with the Red Sox. - Go look at the Red Sox sub, the complaints are eerily similar.

We are a yo-yo team now, We were bad 2 seasons ago, good last season, bad this season... That is by definition a Yo-yo team.",Liverpool,Yes,jen2s71,t1_jen1tij
"Personally I wanted Klopp out in January, I was so frustrated due to the amount of errors he made this season..buying Gakpo really pissed me off when we desperately needed a CM. Our CM is so bad many players could improve it. 

Tactically I felt Klopp has been really poor and always getting outplayed or out done. You can't really agree with what Klopp says to the media to what goes on in the background..he a fucking genius when it comes to football but FSG limit him. I don't think they had any funds in summer. That why they push to sell the club to raise fund for a full rebuild which Klopp told them when he signed a new deal.. he fucking knew this could happen.

Klopp has the least blame for me, FSG has a track record of shit mistakes. Klopp doesn't have the same record.",Liverpool,Yes,jen0xwh,t1_jemzrr4
"Only issue really is the Thursday-Sunday effecting our league campaign next season but if we were in it then I‚Äôd like us to win it. Only trophy we haven‚Äôt won under Klopp

Final is in Dublin next year too which would be class",Liverpool,Yes,jeohjlz,t1_jeoharf
"Our Squad is burnt out by the seasons of playing nearly every game. If we aren‚Äôt in the Champions League, we might as well not be in any European Competition, take next season and go all out in the League",Liverpool,Yes,jeohgl6,t1_jeoharf
"He might not be interested tbf. You'd think at some point he'd have worn the armband more than he has since he's been here with all he's achieved between subs, rotated squads, injuries it often falls on some random players during the season.",Liverpool,Yes,jenr8d1,t1_jenjxm4
"VVD doesn‚Äôt deserve to be captain after this season either tbh. I‚Äôd give it to either Alisson, Robbo or Mo",Liverpool,Yes,jenjqof,t1_jenj9ii
You can't replace players if you don't have the budget to replace them. But if that's all you got from my post then I don't really have much to say to you.,Liverpool,Yes,jeqs9sc,t1_jeqrh1v
Give him two engines besides him and he'll cook again,Liverpool,Yes,jeosckt,t1_jeos4hg
Bellingham fund has already been set aside. We'll use the Tchouameni fund from last season to fund Caicedo,Liverpool,Yes,jeopqr5,t1_jeon0jn
Have some patience. Mane and Firmino weren't immediately world class either if you don't remember,Liverpool,Yes,jeos9j8,t1_jeoqo3o
2024 Champions League final is Wembley followed by Munich in 2025.,Liverpool,Yes,jenm6dd,t1_jenlrla
"Thats basically the same with Elliott, but Trent have the best vision and ball progression in the team.",Liverpool,Yes,jen8hsn,t1_jen757m
"Elliott's positional awareness is the main thing constantly exposing him (along with absolutely no defensive instincts), there is no reason they constantly put him into midfield. He's getting battered every game",Liverpool,Yes,jenau0g,t1_jen757m
Your statement makes zero sense when we've got a RW playing as a CM for majority of our games this season.,Liverpool,Yes,jen9bi6,t1_jen757m
"I think that is complete nonsense tbh. You can‚Äôt tell me that Henderson has a better positional awareness than Trent. When was the last time you saw Henderson defend 2 players on his own? 

Also, being part of the back line is far more challenging defensively. 

The wide 8 role for Liverpool is absolutely perfect for Trent. It would enhance his biggest attributes and hide  some of his weaknesses.",Liverpool,Yes,jeon9pw,t1_jen757m
"Ole came second with the fourth highest high line in the league and broke the record of most away wins. They were also few penalty kicks away from winning the Europa league. 

This guy's high line goes beyond De gea's goal. They have the 18th highest high line in the league with better ball playing defenders and the same goalkeeper. 

His goal difference is single digit and he has been trashed multiple times now away from home. 

Don't know what you are saying if you rate him as a manager, Rashford's good form and Casemiro has put wool over people's eyes. 

They had a lucky run where they played championship level clubs on the way to winning the energy cup, other than that I don't see what he has achieved while spending 300 mill in the market with a good enough squad. 

If he doesn't end up in the top four this season with United fans shouting through the rooftop, I would consider their season a failure.",Liverpool,Yes,jeofcv1,t1_jeoehue
"Yup I can't understand why Liverpool fans rate him so highly. Most matches I have seen United play they seem to be struggling to take control and keep getting away with Rashford's goals. 

Even their cup run was full of easy sides. Any time he has some expectations placed on him he has bombed.",Liverpool,Yes,jeoibua,t1_jeohouo
He‚Äôs gonna cost upwards of 100 million and we‚Äôd still need 2 more good midfielders I don‚Äôt see the owners giving us those funds unfortunately,Liverpool,Yes,jeomvfq,t1_jeolwzi
He‚Äôs a quality player I‚Äôd love Jude but I don‚Äôt think we get a cb 3 midfielders if one is bought,Liverpool,Yes,jeolmgv,t1_jeol5bo
And yet he'll probably start 15+ games next season :),Liverpool,Yes,jenj29h,t1_jen7ray
"It's very hard to adapt when your midfield just doesn't work. Klopp managed to adapt with Rhys Williams and Nat Phillips at CB. Our full backs played closer to the CB and we were a bit deeper. 

But we still had a midfield back then and we could control games. Our midfield could run, press and cover our defensive line. Now we just can't control games. The midfield barely gets involved in our build up play and can't handle any pressure on our ball movement. They don't win duels, don't track runners and get bypassed easily through passes or dribbles. I don't know how you can adapt to that.",Liverpool,Yes,jen9n0k,t1_jen9d06
"Defenders are not supposed to be constantly exposed to 1v1 situations in which they concede a goal if they don't win the duel. They win the duel and no one remembers it. They lose the duel or even a 1v2 and they get blamed. No one remembers the midfielder who didn't track anyone or let the ball go through him. Fact it our defensive line has been shattered this season by an incompetent midfield that is losing the battle every game. Our defenders have a line of ghosts in front of them. They're lost their confidence and it affects their form too. Even Konate is starting to look shaky. He's been mentally worn out by the need to cover so many situations.

Everyone is going after Trent but we have a control sample. Trent is supposedly playing poorly, but is any of our defenders playing well?  If every single of one of them looks ""off form"", then maybe it's not them.",Liverpool,Yes,jen92ni,t1_jen8q7a
It‚Äôs a problem I wouldn‚Äôt want anyone else to be our manager to but his stubbornness to change tactics is hurting us just as much as the players,Liverpool,Yes,jengbvi,t1_jeng01g
I don‚Äôt expect us to completely drop the press but I would like to see us play more compact to stop the obscene amount of chances teams are getting against us because of how open we are,Liverpool,Yes,jenj5c2,t1_jenihid
"City can blow teams away even if you are at your best but it‚Äôs in other games it‚Äôs so obvious how you beat us but yet we seemingly don‚Äôt adapt at all  long ball to the flanks and you are pretty much at our goal

At this point we should just try playing some defensive football instead of trying to constantly press even tho it‚Äôs obvious the players can‚Äôt",Liverpool,Yes,jenign9,t1_jeni684
"Nagelsmann got top four with Hoffenheim, CL semi final with Leipzig and only a point behind Dortmund when sacked. Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a fair comparison.",Liverpool,Yes,jep4nnv,t1_jep2ap4
"Most of the Bayern elite players apparently rated Nagelsmann highly, I'll take their word for it",Liverpool,Yes,jep5aau,t1_jep2ap4
this kinda fucks Spurs honestly. Probably wouldve gotten him,Liverpool,Yes,jep9scc,t1_jep2ub1
I‚Äôm not writing it off just yet. Still 10 off games to go. With Thiago and Diaz coming back in‚Ä¶maybe we can have a chance. The problem has been midfield all season.,Liverpool,Yes,jeos0it,t1_jeomkkq
"I mean, wtf do you expect?

The players have clearly stopped giving a fuck. The owners couldn‚Äôt give less of a fuck. The only people within the club that actually act like they care and try and Klopp, Ali, Hendo, Harvey, Nunez, Milner & The Spanish wonder kid midfielder that‚Äôs name I can‚Äôt spell. 

The rest of them haven‚Äôt given a fuck all season really. If they players wearing the shirt for us don‚Äôt care and won‚Äôt try what‚Äôs the point?",Liverpool,Yes,jenu1u4,t1_jennqqy
Yeah we only have ourselves to blame for not being better in the transfer window.,Liverpool,Yes,jenetfd,t1_jene81f
"I may well be wrong, but I'm not 100% convinced arsenal are going to consistently be an 85 point plus team. They may well, and probably should win the title, but I see it more as one of those seasons which came out of nowhere and then they fall back to a steady top 4 team after that, rather than constant title challengers.",Liverpool,Yes,jenl05d,t1_jene81f
"I don't disagree with you but I'll also be interested to see what happens when the sun isn't shining. Even City have their off seasons - let's see what happens when the honeymoon phase is over, that's when we'll really see if they're here to stay.",Liverpool,Yes,jenur4g,t1_jene81f
"Not to mention we play demonstrably worse after a break, and have done for years",Liverpool,Yes,jenlgox,t1_jenhle5
"Acting like Van Dijk didn't play in the world cup and didn't get called up in the international break. Trent got called up to the world cup only to not play at all, you don't know what sort of effect that can have on a player. The best thing would have been Trent not getting called up at all",Liverpool,Yes,jenhyp1,t1_jenhle5
"Honestly I wasn't gonna include either of them, just have 4 defenders and 6 attackers. But nobody would take that seriously",Liverpool,Yes,jeni2zj,t1_jenhm5h
"Lad it irks me so much, people just want change for the sake of change when things aren't going well, not a single thought behind it 

I actually can't get over people thinking they'd be happier seeing us playing Pulisball against relegation teams",Liverpool,Yes,jepcfcu,t1_jepbldf
"What's Millwall's reputation for?
I am kinda new to football",Liverpool,Yes,jenv7xi,t1_jenp2r0
"Do you not think if next season, after getting a bunch of midfield reinforcements, if things didn‚Äôt get significantly better, then maybe he would, and should, be asked to leave anyway?

Klopp doesn‚Äôt walk out of contracts. It‚Äôs not his style.",Liverpool,Yes,jemx2xj,t1_jemtesl
"Yeah it‚Äôs disappointing but equally he‚Äôs not one to compromise, so if this is the system he thinks will work in 23/24 with a new midfield, then I don‚Äôt blame him for using it. Makes more sense for Konate, Trent, Gakpo, Nunez etc. to stay used to playing this system rather than trying something temporary in the hope we get top 4. It took a long, long time before Klopp instructed Kobak, Philips and Williams to stop playing a high line a few years ago. He‚Äôs a stubborn man.",Liverpool,Yes,jen6wmx,t1_jen5g8e
The only good performances he had were before his unfortunate injury last season... other than that his overall contribution on the field is negligible,Liverpool,Yes,jenifbx,t1_jenhg16
"Pep is the better tactician, which has been abundantly clear this season, but yesterday's game wasn't lost because of our tactics. 

We actually set up pretty well to stop them and the first half was pretty competitive, but as soon as the second city goal went in our players just completely gave up. You can't do much when even the subs that you bring on just refuse to track back.",Liverpool,Yes,jep1fpu,t1_jeovo6a
"City has always played better football, the link up play is class. No matter what anyone says how they break a block no Klopp team could do this.",Liverpool,Yes,jeq8jol,t1_jeovo6a
There is such an invention as the summer transfer window.,Liverpool,Yes,jencegn,t1_jenccpp

"This is it, how many times in the last 5 years have we won at City? While in form and top of the world, two or three times? People expecting anything but a trouncing yesterday are morons lol

That being said it could have been less of a cake walk for city but really highlighted how poor the midfield is.",Liverpool,Yes,jen26s2,t1_jemygk8
I‚Äôm not Klopp Out yet. I‚Äôm near though. He‚Äôs a big big reason the team is where it is today and no one seems to think that‚Äôs a massive offence. We deflect to FSG way to quickly. Klopp has allowed a lot of this rot and imo he needs to take account for it. If I was Klopp out I‚Äôd just say Klopp out.,Liverpool,Yes,jen1437,t1_jen0zo7
"i dont agree with everything owl said but why is every slightest hint of Klopp criticism instantly and more importantly without any counterargument dismissed? 

Klopp deserves to be backed this summer and the chance to go again even if he loses every single remaining game this season but this bad season is also on him. Yes, hes been letdown massively by FSG but hes not blameless. Do you not remember him listing all our midfielders asking ""what more do we need?"" All I know is Pearce wouldve been eaten alive, had he said that.

Do you see any sort of tactical identity on the pitch? I literally couldn't tel you the way we play other than ""Hoofball to Mo and Nunez and inshallah"". Why does he bring on Ox who is done at this club and promptly caused a goal against (no that Grealish one wasnt on Trent) but leave Carvalho rot on the bench?",Liverpool,Yes,jen1w8e,t1_jen0j2e
"6 deluded dislikes, as I said , we are delusional.. I‚Äôll continue though whilst it stared us right in the face as I have done this season. Enjoy bad result after bad result with the manager constantly referring to summer to please this fickle fan base so that we don‚Äôt think about the here and now.",Liverpool,Yes,jen0qk6,t1_jen0j2e
"So you want our club being mid tier again? winning against united is the best achievement we can have cause we can‚Äôt compete against top clubs, finished 6-7th and said ynwa every end of the season? You want that?",Liverpool,Yes,jen5rbq,t1_jen0j2e
"He‚Äôs not my first target for criticism, I literally just go through our attack and maybe that came across too harsh but the fact is he‚Äôs struggled for the most part since AFCON. We aren‚Äôt ever going to recoup any money for him either so we need to have some sort of younger option ready to step in when he really drops off.",Liverpool,Yes,jenb1i6,t1_jenagzz
You‚Äôve not really given one reason as to why they‚Äôll fly though? Do you really see Nunez playing on the right? It worked in the case of Mane and Salah because they were two of the best wingers of a generation. Diaz could maybe play on the right but that‚Äôs about it.,Liverpool,Yes,jennuw7,t1_jenmy6y
Ever the optimist,Liverpool,Yes,jenfju9,t1_jenf4mw
Ahh I seen a post earlier by James Joyce but I have no idea how credible he is,Liverpool,Yes,jep3whj,t1_jep3og7
"I honestly don't think there is anything any manager could do to fix our midfield without at least 150 million. I am quite confident it is bottom 5 in terms of quality now especially with no Thiago. Trent has been utter shit but at the same it's not even remotely difficult for teams to take advantage of him. Our midfield is just an illusion these days. It feels like whatever attacking strategy the opposition comes up with it will work easily as they have no resistance to getting the ball wherever they want it.

We'll allow the massive Fabinho drop off even though there were signs last season, but even still the fact Henderson and Elliot are our go to midfielders with the recent success we have had says a lot about our club. I'd understand it if Elliot was some generational looking talent but the guy isn't even a midfielder let alone a generational one.

I find it hard to criticise Klopp and his tactics while thats the case. Honestly can't remember the last time we went into a game and I compared the midfields and thought yeah we have more quality than them.",Liverpool,Yes,jenkp2i,t1_jen63t5
When has he had a run in the team? The dude has like 6 assists this season and when he gets a run then all of a sudden he goes on the bench for 10 games.,Liverpool,Yes,jen15hi,t1_jen0u70
I think the winter world cup is fair if the host nation(s) have harsh summers. But they're never going to work anything out with the different leagues,Liverpool,Yes,jep92xr,t1_jep79ho
"It's more of a defensive issue. We have scored , I'd call ourselves still the 3rd best attack after City and Arsenal. 

Sometime it's not that complicated, Just sit back. Why should we press shit teams when we don't have the legs. Again, City would beat us anyway, but midtable shit teams will find it hard if we just don't press them too high. We are gifting these shit teams. Stop doing it. I don't know if it's pride, but Klopp just has to make the call. Go for 1-0 wins. To hell with heavy metal, it's a lot of things on the line for us.",Liverpool,Yes,jeowp58,t1_jeovhtp
"dont bother. This guy is basically Klopp out, thinks Konate is a bad signing, Jota mid table quality and a striker like Darwin should be in his prime at 24. Utterly clueless",Liverpool,Yes,jeowgzc,t1_jeovcdb
That would be Nunes who isn't even a guaranteed starter for Wolves. Only the best will do I suppose.,Liverpool,Yes,jeoxak4,t1_jeovcdb
"We look horrendous at the back because we have no midfield. We looked as horrible for the first part of last season as well, before Luis Diaz came and turned the season around. Two solid midfielders will sort it out.",Liverpool,Yes,jen3coc,t1_jen35zm
">This stigma in having our midfielders pressing and retaining the ball is a myth, none of them has shown they are capable of doing so consistently.

They are not capable of doing that but that is our whole game plan. Our system doesn't allow our midfielders to have any impact on the game. They are just there to recycle possession and pass the ball to the fullbacks. That's why they rarely assist or score a goal. Trent in the midfield would only work if we change our system and move away from the dreadful 433.",Liverpool,Yes,jep7m55,t1_jeoug1k
If we change the system and play with a double pivot while giving Trent a free role where he wouldn't have to cover the fullbacks and would be allowed to join the attack then that could work. But Klopp is just not flexible enough to make such big changes to the system. We are still going to play the same 433 next year even after a full preseason with new players.,Liverpool,Yes,jep9e2i,t1_jeopck4
Needs genuine competition at the RB spot/someone to rotate with imo.,Liverpool,Yes,jeo46d5,t1_jeo3soe
Can confirm that Sage guy is a proper FSG simp. Said he felt bad that people ask Fsg to spend money from their pockets. Proper Stockholm syndrome going on here.,Liverpool,Yes,jenryur,t1_jenr28p
Is the ‚Äúmore signings = finish higher in the league‚Äù supposed to be a joke?,Liverpool,Yes,jenqfvt,t1_jennifl
"Oh yeah its disgusting i agree, however they do actually need spend more and its all about Potter staying and Boely trusting him with that money

They have several old defenders who are injury prone too. Like they  played a back 3 yesterday with two fullbacks and theyve went all season with no striker. They will sadly spend another couple of hundred million in the summer.

They dont seem ti care about this seasons league results so I'd honestly be surprised to see him sacked at this point",Liverpool,Yes,jenjm57,t1_jenhwyy
Ten Haag is an overrated bum so definitely.,Liverpool,Yes,jeokeit,t1_jeokb4z
"I reckon he‚Äôd be eyeing up West Ham, Spurs and maybe even Forest",Liverpool,Yes,jenz1r7,t1_jenrhyz
Is it ever not?,Liverpool,Yes,jemyc7a,t1_jemsg5o
">Hendo isn't press resistant, fast, or blessed with dribbling ability either.

Hendo started as a traditional winger in his early days, the type who could spam crosses and run for days and then transitioned into a midfielder. 

This is why he worked best with Trent on the right hand side and provided him assistance whenever trent bombed forward he would just drop in and play an auxiliary right back role. 

He did the same thing for England in the world cup. 

So he didn't have to be press resistant/or have dribbling skills to play that Midfield role, his energy made it certain that he could just run with the ball and just would pass it if he was under pressure. 

Trent isn't that guy. He is lanky and awkward. Kimmich is more similar to henderson mould than he is to Trent's mould. 

>""he gets in a fullback position and would be a liability on the counter attack."" - this really emphasises the extent of the problem with Trent, a fullback who isn't trusted to cover at fullback. He'd have to learn ...

But that's the issue with any fullback though, you don't expect any defender to be constantly isolated and have to play 2 vs 1 for the majority of the time. 

Just look at Reece James in the back four he is a disaster waiting to happen. 

Same for hakimi when he plays for PSG and for Dormuntd and Inter Milan. 

All defenders need support, Trent gets no support from Elliot on the right nor fabinho or hendo.",Liverpool,Yes,jenl71z,t1_jenk9o7
Mount issue is the number of years they are offering to him he doesn't want to sign an 8 year old deal. If they reduce the number of years I think he will sign a new deal.,Liverpool,Yes,jep1liw,t1_jep1djt
"Completely agree - looks as much of a mental/attitude issue as it does them physically not being good enough.

Soon as that second goal went in their collective heads went. Exact same as what happened against Madrid.",Liverpool,Yes,jenhu55,t1_jencv36
"Yeah definitely. If our coaching staff can only make us work with very specific pieces, then they aren't good enough for this level. 

I've always viewed coaching staff as the brains which look at the individual elements that are available and then create something which is greater than the sum of the individual pieces. That hasn't happened once this season.",Liverpool,Yes,jenawdy,t1_jenalmz
What baffles me is so few of the fans who watch us every week can recognise that,Liverpool,Yes,jenmfky,t1_jenalmz
"Midfield needs someone like Jude because it's been neglected for 3-4yrs now. So we cannot get a 10m mid and give him time to come good.

But minamino type signings across positions every now and then, one of them will surely come good..either slot into our playing 11 or be sold for a havertz, cucurella type fee.",Liverpool,Yes,jeoqha5,t1_jeodv5k
"Watching Machin dedicate an entire episode to having a moan about being called a shill was tortuous. My biggest gripe with Redmen isn't even that they're pathetic sellouts, it's that they're fucking boring and repetitive.",Liverpool,Yes,jenqsko,t1_jenqd5a
"Nah I think he was genuinely just on a decline. Even before he got that injury at PSG he was their worst midfielder/player, every PSG fan wanted him gone. I think I even recall him being given the title of Ligue 1 flop of the season.",Liverpool,Yes,jep8a9a,t1_jep7rm0
"Couldn't believe the slander at the time, still can't believe it now. Fella was doing the job of three men, as with all of our players we run them into the ground with no back up and not even a fucking thank you",Liverpool,Yes,jepbvu7,t1_jep8flo
Kompany too soon to go for him. Frank Lampard ? Surely not.,Liverpool,Yes,jenznnb,t1_jenue3v
"Really? Thanks to that new stadium of theirs, they're loaded with debt. At most, I'd put it down to the benefits of living in London.",Liverpool,Yes,jentjjl,t1_jensbgi
"Arsenal fans shouldn‚Äôt even be talking to us until they beat City. If they do fair enough or else they don‚Äôt get to talk about us not beating City when they haven‚Äôt in seasons. We already beat City twice this season, more number of times than they would.",Liverpool,Yes,jenw9pg,t1_jenvc3o
Havent checked out his stats so maybe you have a point. I just know whenever I caught some of Shakthar  he looked good. Was sure he‚Äôd make a move somewhere,Liverpool,Yes,jeqg6x5,t1_jeq2lqe
"...maybe I dreamt the Nunez signing & Gakpo in the winter, we weren't thr only club in for them and they still ended up here. 

Mount wont even be in the conference league if he stays with Chelsea, no one knows what Judes intentions are, but klopp managed to sell liverpool to the likes of VVD when we were in a much worse place",Liverpool,Yes,jenmv4x,t1_jen0i5a
"That‚Äôs completely false, why are you lying?",Liverpool,Yes,jen1xwd,t1_jen0i5a

"We‚Äôve finished top four every season barring the first under klopp, when we were ‚Äúbad‚Äù the season before last we finished 3rd‚Ä¶.

I couldn‚Äôt give a fuck about the Red Sox, Klopp literally said the other day we will be spending and in the summer there was money available and he decided to stick with this squad.

You‚Äôve ignored all other points barring the ones you can wrongly reply to, I struggle to understand why you kids are so desperate to be so angry.",Liverpool,Yes,jen3i0b,t1_jen2s71
"I‚Äôm so glad actual match going fans aren‚Äôt as fickle as you plastics, fucking state of you‚Ä¶",Liverpool,Yes,jen1wfp,t1_jen0xwh
"On the Bright Side

No more 12:30 Kickoffs",Liverpool,Yes,jeohvui,t1_jeohjlz
I definitely think it could cause problems but depending on the group we could rest our main player during the group stages,Liverpool,Yes,jeohw1c,t1_jeohjlz
It gives us another way of qualifying for the CL and we should be able to rest our main player during the group stage,Liverpool,Yes,jeohmxj,t1_jeohgl6
We never know never heard any conversations regarding it.,Liverpool,Yes,jenrghk,t1_jenr8d1
"And who spent 120m Nunez Gakpo than Midfielder? What about loan or stop gaps? Barcelona did that when they suffered on financial, United did with Sabitzer, Zakaria with Chelsea, while we can‚Äôt do that? And stuck with fucking Keita Ox Jones?",Liverpool,Yes,jeqsy2v,t1_jeqs9sc
I think it's more than his legs have just gone. The man struggles to make tackles these days.,Liverpool,Yes,jeosp30,t1_jeosckt
Delusional,Liverpool,Yes,jeot2lh,t1_jeosckt
Where is this money if it has been set aside. Certainly doesn't show up in the accounts. Only 14 mill is there.,Liverpool,Yes,jeov0al,t1_jeopqr5
Mane was brilliant for us straight away. Firmino took to Klopp‚Äôs style relatively quickly as well. Nunez doesn‚Äôt even look like a Klopp player. I‚Äôve been more impressed with Gakpo.,Liverpool,Yes,jeoszgh,t1_jeos9j8
Lets not forget that he's actually a defender so he CAN defend better than Hendo and Elliott.,Liverpool,Yes,jen9f8z,t1_jen8hsn
"It makes zero sense because we've already made a glaring mistake playing Elliot out of position in CM?

Sure, let's try it with another player too..",Liverpool,Yes,jevdg2i,t1_jen9bi6
"When was the last time I saw Henderson defend 2 players on his own..

How about constantly over the last few years whilst Trent bombed forward üòÇ. I can't say Henderson categorically has better positional awareness than Trent, but you can't say Trent's is better either to be honest. 

The wide 8 role for Liverpool is absolutely perfect for Trent, yet Klopp and the entire coaching staff haven't ever played him there, despite numerous opportunities to do so across various competitions, including friendlies.

He's been world class at RB for years, it's his position, he's just being exposed by absolutely no cover and the entire system ahead of him playing like shit, so he's an easy target.",Liverpool,Yes,jevd2pn,t1_jeon9pw
"You make some good points. Certainly a shit Spurs, Liverpool and Chelsea have made top 4 a piece of piss for him, which he shouldn't need given the ¬£200m+ spent in the summer.",Liverpool,Yes,jeofxvf,t1_jeofcv1
Good thing we need 7 new players then isn‚Äôt it,Liverpool,Yes,jeomqc5,t1_jeolmgv
We need like 5 players anyways,Liverpool,Yes,jeovizz,t1_jeolmgv
"We got top 4 that season because Alison scored from a corner... We lost 6 on the bounce AT HOME. I'm not sure how you think Klopp ""adapted"" so well to Williams and Nat, we were shit and got bailed out by a stupidly magical moment.",Liverpool,Yes,jena8o8,t1_jen9n0k
"Look at our defensive line yesterday, All over the place because our defenders are pushing up to do the midfielders jobs. Elliott just doesn‚Äôt bother tracking back a lot of the time, it‚Äôs embarrassing.",Liverpool,Yes,jenc6tz,t1_jen92ni
"The biggest issue yesterday was thinking that we could get something from this game. The tactics worked in the first half but in the second half we let our fullbacks go forward and they just isolated our center backs and exploited the space on the wings. 

Don't know why Klopp thought there was a game to win, of course the second goal we conceded didn't help at all, if we hadn't conceded that perhaps the game would be totally different. It was very much like the Madrid game. 

We can keep blaming the tactics but at some point the finger has to be pointed at the whole team they keep conceding silly goals, any tactical plan goes out of the way if we keep doing that.",Liverpool,Yes,jenj066,t1_jenign9
"And Brighton was in fourth when Potter left them. 

Sorry I don't rate Bundesliga to be a good judge of player or manager quality. Also this isn't some average club we are talking about, this is chelsea the place is a zoo. They need an experienced hand not another young manager.

I am more afraid of them getting Poch or Enrique.",Liverpool,Yes,jep6bel,t1_jep4nnv

"Yup three at the back is another famous shout here and on twitter. But for that you need three reliable center backs and two hard working midfielders. We have neither of those.

"Hooliganism, xenophobia, racism and the overall basking in the hate others have for their club.",Liverpool,Yes,jenvjho,t1_jenv7xi
"I mean thats basically what happened at BVB. Officially it was a mutually agreed contract termination. While this is often pr for ""we sacked him"", in this case I believe its what it actually was and its probably what it would come to at Liverpool as well.",Liverpool,Yes,jemxq7v,t1_jemx2xj
"If we need to sign as many players as some on here are calling for it would ludicrous to think things will immediately get ""significantly better"". You're looking for green shoots of recovery.

Because social media mostly includes dumb people who do not understand the nuances of any discussion. So everything needs to be hyperbole.,Liverpool,Yes,jen49co,t1_jen1w8e
"Why do I think 5 very good forwards will do well in a functioning side? Odd question but I'll play along. 

Mo Salah is mo salah. And he's got a bunch of G/A in a side that is honestly absolute dog at the moment. He looks after himself so well it's a very real possibility he goes well into his mid 30s at the top level. No concerns there. 

Luis Diaz came in to a team that were looking like being also rans last season and spurred it onto the verge of the impossible.

Diogo Jota started exceptionally well at the club, with a similar scoring rate to Salah initially. The biggest question mark for me after his last 13 months, admittedly, but I've got faith it'll click for him again.

We look a far, far less effective side when Darwin Nunez isn't playing. He's raw, unpredictable, and frustrating at times, but he's got a decentish return for a first season in a team that's all over the place, and it's clear he scares the hell out of defenders.

I was unsure on gakpo initially, but I've seen enough of him now to see the qualities there, he can be an excellent attacking mid or false 9 for us.

With regard to the right side, we're still a few years away from that being an issue imo. And yeah, I can absolutely see Diaz doing that longer term.

 Mane and Salah weren't two of the best wingers in a generation when we signed them. Mane was a midtable  premier league player, and Salah was a Chelsea flop with a few food seasons in Italy. We were hardly signing Messi and Ronaldo. 

Will the lads we've got right now all be here in 5 years? Probably not. Do I think they'll all turn into mane/firmino/Salah? Again probably not. Are they enough to be successful in the next 2/3 years at Liverpool provided everything else is sorted out? Absolutely. 

We've got enough problems at the moment without trying to invent new ones.",Liverpool,Yes,jenp2nk,t1_jennuw7
Who is that?,Liverpool,Yes,jep4ll9,t1_jep3whj
"Why do you think Tsimikas is the answer? He still has fewer assists than Robertson but also looks defensively even worse. Do you remember his performance away to Brentford in January? It was a joke. He's a good squad player but he's not good enough to constantly challenge Robbo for the starting spot, even when Andy is in relatively poor form.",Liverpool,Yes,jen2344,t1_jen15hi
"So many people have exposed themselves with their Klopp agenda this season. Every second comment here is about tactics or formation as if Personnel doesn't matter and thinks will change suddenly if Klopp employed a new formation.

"But what can he do if the owners choose to reduce debt using money from the revenue. 

All this information is in the accounts which have come out. Fsg chose to use 40 mill to reduce debt and that was Nunes release clause which wolves paid cause we made a deal with Mendes. 

Fsg didn't want to pay his release clause it's so apparent. 

We had 14 mill in the bank what midfielder was Klopp getting using that money? He never wanted Melo and he was forced upon him, like Ben Davies before. Neither got any playing time.",Liverpool,Yes,jeoy16e,t1_jeoxak4
I don‚Äôt think so. I‚Äôm starting to join the camp to move Trent into midfield and get a solid right back in. That will solve a lot of problems I think. I also think we need to get rid of Gomez and Matip. Between them two and Konate they are all injured far too much. I‚Äôd sign a right back and two centre backs.,Liverpool,Yes,jen3pke,t1_jen3coc
"Telling part for me is when the ball goes straight from defense to offense, we're skipping midfield entirely. Even the players don't trust that midfield. And when we do get the ball to the midfielders we do nothing but slow down the game, lose the ball or play hot potato footy. Personally, I believe upgrading the midfield would do wonders for our confidence and team cohesion. Might not fix the problem entirely (shaky defense), but it'll go a long way.",Liverpool,Yes,jen9t73,t1_jen3coc

"Why do you assume I am angry? I don't believe, I cussed or flamed anyone for you to think that I am angry at the situation.

Regarding to the Red Sox - I presented you to evidence that our owners aren't willing to invest in the club by drawing parallels to another 'club' that they own... You just dismissing this arguing in bad faith, because why?

Is it not fair to look at the last 3 seasons, is it not fair to point out that there is a yo-yo trend starting to form? Again, why did you dismiss the point I was making by going back even further?

I didn't want to argue your other points because I believe the lack of investments into the squad depth has contributed to our players burning out.

I have always maintained that Liverpool have the money - The owners don't want to spend because they want our club to be sustainable. I did a small little research into our spending :

22/23- Spent 137.30 Mil- Sold 80.70 Mil- Turnover -56.6 Mil

21/22- Spent 87 Mil- Sold 29.55 Mil- Turnover -57.45 Mil

20/21- Spent 84.05 Mil- Sold 17.02 Mil- Turnover -66.85 Mil

19/20- Spent 10.40 Mil- Sold 44.50 Mil- Turnover + 34.10 Mil

18/19- Spent 182.20 Mil- Sold 41.32 Mil- Turnover -140.88 Mil

FSG are pretty disciplined fiscally. Since the 11/12 Season, FSG has a Neg Transfer Turnover between 40 Mil to 60 Mil 7 times. That is excluding the 18/19 and 19/20. They unusually spent a lot in the 18/19 season and unusually spent nothing in 19/20. If you combined those 2 seasons, their neg turnover on transfer would be (-140.88Mil + 34.10 Mil) / 2= -53.39Mil. Which is in line with their transfer policy.

The club have spent money in the past, unfortunately they haven't adjusted for inflation post 2019... 50+ Mil in 2013 is not the same as 50+ Mil in 2023.

Same journalist different article 

> Ultimately, financial decisions rest in the hands of FSG president Mike Gordon and it took Henderson‚Äôs hamstring injury against Newcastle before the green light was finally given to bolster the midfield.

Midfield targets were there, but FSG did not give the green light to bolster the midfield since Bellingham was not available and all they coughed up was enough only for Arthur. 

From the same publication, combination of journalists re Gakpo: 

> At the recent World Cup, Gakpo‚Äôs three goals in five games ramped up the noise surrounding his future. And Van Dijk was there to advocate for him.

> It all came together very quickly.

> Gakpo was already on Liverpool‚Äôs list of summer 2023 transfer targets but when it emerged PSV were willing to sell in this winter window, the club felt it was an opportunity they could not afford to miss. Injuries to Luis Diaz and Diogo Jota also contributed to the decision.

PSV decided to sign and other clubs were circling so Liverpool moved. This is once again a financial and not a coaching decision. The plan was Gakpo in the summer very much like the Diaz signing. 

> In a move reminiscent of beating Tottenham Hotspur to sign Diaz from Porto a year ago, Liverpool pounced to capture a player six months earlier than originally planned.",Liverpool,Yes,jeqtlxt,t1_jeqsy2v
"he doesn‚Äôt necessarily struggle to tackle, he struggles to operate within a lot of space which has always been a problem with him, just got covered up in the past with functional players around him",Liverpool,Yes,jeoukcb,t1_jeosp30
"Fabinho next to prime Wijnaldum and Henderson was world class because they covered up his deficiencies. Now next to Elliott, a finished Henderson and Thiago obviously he‚Äôll get exposed",Liverpool,Yes,jeotmnw,t1_jeot2lh
Mane in his first season wasnt nearly the player he was by his third season. You can just look at the statistics. Firmino didn‚Äôt quite click as a false nine until 17/18,Liverpool,Yes,jeota68,t1_jeoszgh
No it makes zero sense because Trents defensive contributions are still better than Hendo and Elliott. He's also a better passer of the ball than the other two.,Liverpool,Yes,jevlh6t,t1_jevdg2i
"Henderson has never defended 2 players on his own. He has never faced an overload in the right hand side of the box and had to choose which one to defend first.

Henderson has also never had to cover for Trent. Henderson most of the time is actually further forward than Trent. The player who covers the space is the centre back. Henderson‚Äôs job is to put pressure on players in the midfield, which defends the space left by Trent. Bit of a difference there. 

Henderson defends in a group, in an overload of our advantage, where Trent is exposed to more individual battles.

As for Trent not being played there, do you agree with every decision Klopp has ever made? Is he perfect?

Bellingham is going to cost more than ¬£100m, tbh there aren‚Äôt that many midfielders out there for us to sign. Can‚Äôt see us signing Bellingham plus one other midfielder. However, there are quite a few decent right backs that would be a lot cheaper",Liverpool,Yes,jew47bc,t1_jevd2pn
"Yup and that squad wasn't that bad to begin with. He has wasted money on average players like Anthony, hasn't done anything with Sancho either. Away from home he hasn't learnt from the trashing he got with man city and others. Came to anfield thinking it isn't anything special and got taught a lession. Look at the amount of big defeats they have faced this season.

"You don‚Äôt remember what happened that season. Those losses were not with Rhys and Nat. Our record with them in the team was impressive and once we moved Fabinho from CB back into midfield, we went on an unbeaten run and finished 3rd after being 10 points off 4th.

"The top 4 race was actually relatively comfortable considering how poor the middle of the season was. The alisson goal felt massive, but had we drawn that west brom game we'd have finished 3rd on goal difference , 2 points ahead of Leicester in 5th.",Liverpool,Yes,jenly90,t1_jena8o8
"You're not wrong, but it's worth remembering that Elliott is a 19 year old number 10/ winger. He shouldn't be asked to play that role. The fact is that there is noone else.

We're now looking at 37 year old James milner potentially starting a good chunk of games during the run in. Who knows what's happened to Curtis Jones.",Liverpool,Yes,jenmact,t1_jenc6tz
"Of course the players deserve plenty of blame but the tactics are just not helping at all you can‚Äôt be expecting us to not get exposed defensively when it‚Äôs clear fab can‚Äôt do what‚Äôs asked of him and then having him be exposed alone in midfield as the other two mids have tried to press and failed at it

"You‚Äôre straight up wrong there. Tsimikas on current form is the better player. That Brentford game absolutely everyone was awful, mostly Konate yet they all get a pass apparently. Robbo has had multiple stinkers this season defensively and in possession doesn‚Äôt even come close to Tsimikas atm. Our fans are way too loyal to our old boys that they can‚Äôt see the blatantly obvious.",Liverpool,Yes,jen4l5b,t1_jen2344
"> if Personnel doesn't matter

thats it for me. No formation on this planet works with Hendo, Fab, Elliott in midfield. Besides that, he cant now change the entire approach only to turn it around completely again after the next 11 games when he hopefully gets the reinforcements he needs. 

Klopp isnt perfect, him not seeing the signs of decline in midfield is partially what brought us into this mess but if you have Henderson or Ox or Elliott too lazy or exhausted or short legged to track back and leave Trent 2v1 with KDB and Grealish, no tactic apart from maybe 5 atb can cover that up (which again that would be a huge identity shift he would then have to reverse).",Liverpool,Yes,jep4qr5,t1_jeowvk0
"I'll assume you were a card carrying member of the ""in Rafa we trust we brigade""? Felt we did the dirty on Evans when we bought Houllier in? Thought maybe Houllier deserved a bit more time? Rodgers was undone by the transfer committee? 

Club first, if Klopp turns it around fantastic, I'll be happy to be wrong. Honestly, I don't think he will, but he has enough credit in the bank to try. If we are still playing this lifeless, passionless, and yes tactically pathetic football this time next year, then I think an awful lot of people who appear to believe that Klopp is utterly infallible may need to reassess their blind faith.

And I'm sure we can pretend that we have forgotten everyone's takes that prove to be wrong.",Liverpool,Yes,jep2hdz,t1_jeowvk0
"The issue at Liverpool is not we don't have money to spend on transfers, it's that our wage bill is a bloated mess.

If we clear out that combined near ¬£500k a week from the wage bill, I think we can set our standards a little higher than Nunes.",Liverpool,Yes,jeoyw6u,t1_jeoy16e
"Fair enough. I feel pretty confident that it will. Trent shouldn't be moved, but we need someone that can help him out. No midfielders are there to be seen when he needs cover.

"I think you need to read my comment again, I didn't mention his defensive contribution or his passing ability, I said it's his positional awareness is the main issue that keeps exposing him, which is absolutely true beyond argument and would likely be highlighted even further playing in CM.

"Ole was a terrible man manager as he played the same starting 11 every game running his players into the ground and playing Rashford through injury. He was also WAY too much of a player's coach.

100% this is the point I was making and you fully understood it. The best example is the United game! He didn't play against wolves and was on fire for United. He can't play twice a week anymore. Don't forget he was playing for Scotland in euro games.,Liverpool,Yes,jen4ehe,t1_jen2rv1
That's true but also emblematic of the current state of the squad. It's difficult to select fringe players when the whole squad isn't in form because they end up looking even worse. Then the regulars have to keep starting games and the vicious cycle rolls on. Tsimikas isn't exactly the solid kind of fullback who we could swap in to sure up the defence too. Maybe that's an issue in trying to sign almost like for like players.,Liverpool,Yes,jen370j,t1_jen2rv1
"I think you're massively overrating him. His Brentford performance was one of the worst individual displays we've seen this season. He was bullied with and without the ball. Looked massively out of his depth. Konate was poor too but we aren't talking about his position so I don't see the relevance. Plus he has a far higher performance ceiling than Tsimikas has ever shown.

Sometimes the alternative isn't always the better option. He's a solid squad player who's only role should be to allow Robertson some rest now and again. Defensively he's lightweight and lacks any kind of the cut and drive Robbo offers going forward. Displays the kind of listless energy in facing opponents that Trent gets slaughtered for. He's never really going to offer Robertston serious competition for his starting place.",Liverpool,Yes,jen6e0h,t1_jen4l5b
"We don't even have enough quality center backs to play 3 at the back and that would leave 2 center midfielders in the middle ready to be dominated and exploited.

">The issue at Liverpool is not we don't have money to spend on transfers, it's that our wage bill is a bloated mess

No it isn't we have space in the wage bill since taki, origi, mane, neco left and we just added Nunez and ramsay at that time. Nunez and ramsay weren't getting a big sum. That's half a million wages saved there right there. 

We have money in the wage bill. I can't understand how you can blame Klopp when he isn't given the funds since FSG would rather use that money to reduce the overall debt than make it available for transfers. 

>We cannot keep offering new contracts to the injury prone and aging players at the club. Which is an issue caused by Klopp (see Henderson, Milner, Gomez and Firmino). If we clear out that combined near ¬£500k a week from the wage bill, I think we can set our standards a little higher than Nunes.

We haven't you are making no sense. Milner is on reduced terms his wages barely affect the squad, bobby was still contributing off the bench but he is off now as well. 

Henderson was given a contract in 2021 his wages were adjusted by letting Gini leave. Gomez is club trained and home grown what's the point in selling him. He is also young and can be sold on a big profit so giving him a deal made complete sense. 

We have so much space in the wage bill but Fsg would rather let everyone go and people will keep making excuses. This is pathetic.

Nunes was coming off a great campaign last season he was sporting's player of the season, even Pep Guardiola called him the best midfielder in the world.

What does Fsg do then? They don't spend on him and make a deal a year down the line in which he has struggled to settle in wolves, mismanaged tactically and his confidence is shot. Great going Fsg yet people like you keep pointing finger at Klopp.",Liverpool,Yes,jep0pvm,t1_jeoyw6u
I don't fancy Naglesmann for the chelsea job tbh. It's a zoo out there that might turn out to be another avb. Enrique is an option for sure but he would want his own players. I am afraid chelsea might get poch now because Bohley probably wants a yes man,Liverpool,Yes,jepar6n,t1_jepaiv8

On an ideal basis you don't start players who are coming off a gruelling campaign straight away into the team. This should have happened with Fabinho, henderson, Robbo and Vvd but we have no quality backs up and had no choice but to play them straight off the bat.

You are one year behind in everything. This is for post covid season, not this or last. This doesn't reflect the current wages. Our wage bill has heavy bonuses whenever we win a big trophy. Which didn't happen last season nor this one. 

Also this wage bill has money from non playing staff as well included in it. From the likes of Klopp to the dinner lady. I don't know why we do that, since other clubs don't follow this practise of including the wages of playing staff and non playing staff in one wage bill.

When the latest wage bill comes out it will be quite reduced compared to previously.

"I think it's not Bohley but the other guy with him who wanted Potter gone and Bohley probably felt the pressure building and had to give in. 

People don't take fan pressure seriously but it's a thing.

Same..

That's why I want someone like Nagesman to go take the spurs project and prove himself. Win a trophy or two, do well in the league and the cl and then come audition for the Liverpool job in three years time. 

There is no point in getting rejected in a short amount of time in clubs like Madrid or chelsea or Bayern. Go for a project.",Liverpool,Yes,jepkfhh,t1_jepjx0j

""So why didn't we sign any of them? Since Klopp was chasing a midfielder throughout the window?"" 

Because we fixate on one target (Tchouam√©ni) and rarely to never look outside of Germany, Portugal, Holland or England for signings.

"No they‚Äôre a poor reflection of his ability. He is lightning quick with decent movement and could become a good finisher if he settled down. That said, he‚Äôs not very good on the ball, I know this from having watched him play all season. He‚Äôs not cute or skillful enough in tight spaces, like Mane, Salah and Firmino were. He‚Äôs also not a very intelligent player, as seen by his erratic pressing and tendency to be offside. Unless he massively improves in these areas, good luck trying to consistently hit 90 points a season with a player like this. Teams will just sit back and then his pace becomes a non factor, and his technical limitations will be highlighted",Liverpool,Yes,jeovieg,t1_jeouewe

I really don't know how/to when they could change the Everton match if still in CL b/c every wknd & mid-week booked from this wknd thru to May 28.

These recent for TV changes might only create more possible changes eg the previous change of Leeds from Sat May 6 to Sun May 7  - same as above if in CL semis, then either must play the CL Semi on Wed May 10 OR change Leeds, but to when?

Maybe for all of May,  it's Sun (PL) +  Wed (if in CL = Semis plus the makeup PL games of West Ham on Wed May 3 + Brighton possibly on May 24) , & it all works out.",Manchester City,Yes,jf81m8s,t1_jf70yfb

My thoughts are that it‚Äôs stupid to still keep going after Ederson,Manchester City,Yes,jf8g45v,t1_jf89av3
"While I'd prefer a keeper good at his feet with better shot stopping than Ederson, we'll not be running away with the league if we had that ideal keeper. Stats like that just don't analyze the games in question.

We've lost 4 games and drawn 4 games this season.

We drew against Everton, Villa, Forest and Newcastle. Let's analyze these draws.

Against Everton, Forest and Villa, we scored only one goal (even when we had enough chances to bury these games) and the goals scored in these games had nothing to do with Ederson.
Against Everton and Villa, the equalizing goals came late and were curler shots right in the corner. Place the best shot stopper in the world for those games and tell them ahead that the ball is going right in the corner a few inches beside the woodwork so they can dive early and they're still not saving them.

Against Forest, how anyone can look at the utter defensive stupidity from Laporte, Bernardo and Walker and blame Ederson for a goal where an attacking player was allowed to stroll into the defense and play a pass across goal to Chris Wood to shoot in an open net is beyond me. It's as good as blaming Allison for Gundogan's open net goal on Saturday.

Now against Newcastle, maybe you can blame Ederson for Wilson's goal I guess, so a hypothetical better keeper saves that and we win that game. That's (+2) points that could've been saved by a better keeper from 4 draws. 

Our 4 losses came against Liverpool, United, Tottenham and Brentford.

Against Liverpool, Ederson saved the first counter against Salah and Cancelo gave him another chance to redeem himself and no keeper is saving that second chance, Salah was practically running towards goal alone. Against Brentford and Tottenham, there's no need wasting time analyzing because Ederson isn't at fault for the Toney or Kane goals that cost us those games.

Against United, I'm not blaming Ederson for not saving a Bruno Fernandes offside goal but I guess you could lay some blame on him for the Rashford goal (though Akanji is the major culprit for his lousy defending).

So out of our 4 losses, a hypothetical better shot-stopper saves us a point in the united game.

Total points saved is 3 (2 points from our draws and 1 from our losses).

Add 3 points to our current tally and we're still behind Arsenal and not exactly ""running away""  with the league.

My point is - while Ederson is a poor shot stopper, most of his lapses are in those games we won anyway so a better keeper won't have changed much. 

And from the games we dropped points, the best a better shot stopper would've done is add an additional 3 points, not exactly title race defining especially when you consider that Ederson's strengths have been behind some of our wins this season - Ex: The 3 points he single+handedly won us at Leceister earlier in the season.",Manchester City,Yes,jf8khsy,t1_jf89av3
"Laughable 'analysis'. The thread says we lost against Newcastle when we drew which says it all. 

If people have an agenda against a player they should at least be honest about it.

P.s using xg on an individual game basis shows you are a fucking moron.",Manchester City,Yes,jf8lbhi,t1_jf89av3
Posted this a while back and got clowned by one guy lol.,Manchester City,Yes,jf8jewk,t1_jf89av3
"It seems like Tactics Journal is saying, in 3rd Tweet in thread, that Ederson should have saved the following goals & thus ManCity would have gotten 3 points or 1 point instead of only getting 1 point or 0 points?

* 1.8xGA = 3 goals, Newcastle away - don't recall this one enough to have an opinion
* 1.3xGA = 2 goals,  Brentford @ home - maybe the 2nd goal in extra time, but to me bigger fault of team getting caught on break w only a few players having speed/energy to rush back in 97th minute.
* 1.7xGA = 2 goals,  Manchester United away - I think the mad ref decision had more of a negative impact than Ederson.
* 0.3xGA = 1 goal, Aston Villa away - don't recall this one enough to have an opinion
* 0.1xGA = 1 goal, Everton @ home, Gray goal - from what I recall that was not easy save, totally unexpected shot the commentators said Ederson had no chance to save.
* 0.9xGA = 1 goal, Nottingham Forest away - I put that draw more on the goals ManCity didn't score, ha.

This sentence also seems a tad dramatic - *Man City would have run away with the league if they had any other goalkeeper*.

I‚Äôm not a Ederson shill. I‚Äôm a City shill, and I will defend our players until I‚Äôm absolutely without a defense. I used to defend Sterling and Jesus when people went after them, but not once they left the club.

If we weren‚Äôt 2nd lowest in the league by goals conceded I might take the Ederson criticism more seriously. Dias‚Äô return leading to the big improvement in our defense can‚Äôt really be ignored either because suddenly we are getting clean sheets frequently and barely conceding. If the only issue was Ederson we wouldn‚Äôt have seen an impact this big from Dias. 

Not sure about being called a Cancelo shill though because I don‚Äôt think I said I want him back or defended him since he left like I do Ederson. I am kinda hoping we get some money for him at least.

Sometimes we just didn‚Äôt have the goal scorer we needed or the defense/Ederson had a bad game.

">In the mid-1950s, the Manchester City manager [Les McDowall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_McDowall) introduced a new tactical system using a deep-lying centre-forward, which became known as the [Revie Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revie_Plan) after [Don Revie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Revie) who played centre-forward.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Trautmann#cite_note-revie-37) **The system depended on maintaining possession of the ball wherever possible**, which required Trautmann to make use of his throwing ability. For goalkeepers of Trautmann's era, it was usual to kick the ball as far as possible downfield after making a save. By contrast, Trautmann, influenced by the Hungarian goalkeeper [Gyula Grosics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyula_Grosics), sought to start attacks by throwing the ball to a wing-half, typically [Ken Barnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Barnes_(English_footballer)) or [John McTavish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McTavish_(footballer,_born_1932)). The wing-half then passed to Revie to develop the attack.[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Trautmann#cite_note-T157-38)

>The system was named after Manchester City player [Don Revie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Revie), who had the most important role in it.

"They didn't shift into a technical team by choice, their core players became shit overnight (Henderson and fab)
So klopp is adapting by including players like bajectic and Harvey to their midfield which forces them to play in this way. 

I agree with your second point, just signing Bellingham won't help their team. They need one 6 and two 8s. Should bin Henderson and fabinho imo",Manchester City,Yes,jez0eop,t1_jeyy4sx
"Jota lowkey been ass, 0 goal since April 2022 against us.",Manchester City,Yes,jez9ewf,t1_jez25zv
"Honestly, I'm quite excited about our games against Bayern. It's been years since we last played them and I've always wonder how we would have fared against them since Pep joined us.

He extended his contract until 2026 before the end of last season...,Manchester City,Yes,jewy8vm,t1_jewxa9t

"We drew against Nottingham forest and a shit Steven Gerrard's Aston villa. Arsenal lost to Everton and drew with bottom of the table Southampton. We can make the ""easy"" games look tough if we want to, just look at the shitshow at palace a few weeks back.

I'm confident if we win all our 10 games we win the league (because Arsenal will also drop points in another game). If we lose this league, I'm 100% sure it will be due to our own fuck up and not because Arsenal will win all their games.",Manchester City,Yes,jew74ex,t1_jev354t

Could be a good alternative but he's very tough to get.,Manchester City,Yes,jey2f9j,t1_jextsbp

Nah his attitude stinks,Manchester City,Yes,jew8vyz,t1_jew3rth
"Sancho isn't a premier league winger. I've known this when he was at Dortmund and even now at United. Same way Jude for 100 million+ will be a waste of money considering we can get at least 2 similar players for that money.

He's going to stay at United to run down his contract because no one else is stupid enough to pay him 350k a week to deliver that crap week in week out before he eventually fucks off again to Bundesliga or Serie A.",Manchester City,Yes,jew6s0j,t1_jew3rth
"Talent is there which is unfortunate, he can do great things but not nearly as consistently as we would want. I think Pep was right on this one even though it's a feel bad to lose a player with that potential.",Manchester City,Yes,jexwzhf,t1_jew3rth

"I like him too but to be fair Brighton were in 9th place last year and 4th place when he took over, and he has them in 6th place now.

With Emery, Villa finished in 14th last year, I think they were down to 16th when he took over, and they're in 7th now.",Manchester City,Yes,jez0c85,t1_jeyy6nq
"It's grossly unfair to suggest anyone other than Arteta should be manager of the year whoever wins the league from here on.

Taking Arsenal to where they were to where they are is extremely impressive.

That squad to be 8 points ahead of city in April is magnificent. Game in hand notwithstanding.",Manchester City,Yes,jez9pow,t1_jeyxxpj
"not true, they shifted to a more possession based system the year they won the league, using Trent and Robertson as wide midfielders to help control possession and the flow of the game instead of the heavy metal football you're thinking of. The main problem is Van Dijk has fallen a long way, and is no longer able to defend single-handedly when they play their insanely high line, and so Trent is being exposed for the below average defender he is.",Manchester City,Yes,jf16gwu,t1_jez0eop
This. But I think he would walk anyway before being sacked if he doesn‚Äôt turn it around next season.,Manchester City,Yes,jex9gwx,t1_jex30o6

Wait there's a sub for Ronaldo?,Manchester City,Yes,jey2l8e,t1_jexwor4
We won Euro final without him and portugal squad is actually top 5 team.,Manchester City,Yes,jexa5c0,t1_jex5ijh
fairly certain 2006-8 was a very good Portugal side.,Manchester City,Yes,jeylwvu,t1_jex5ijh
I've heard nothing about his attitude though. Seems to me like a good kid but he's just not good enough to fit in a top 6 squad at the moment. What about his attitude stinks?,Manchester City,Yes,jew98wp,t1_jew8vyz
That makes sense tbf was just interested if people would want him given his time at Dortmund. Also forgot he was on kdb level cash. One to join Maguire on the utd bench for now I guess.,Manchester City,Yes,jexxd00,t1_jexwzhf
"I saw a graph analysing the relative strength of oppositions we'll both face heading into the final day and while Arsenal have the tougher fixtures, we're just next to them on the scale. Arsenal have a fixture strength of 51, while we have 50 something like that.

So while we have the ""easier""  fixtures, it's not that much easier than Arsenal's games. 

If Liverpool take points off Arsenal and we win against them, that's the title wrapped up before the final day IMO.",Manchester City,Yes,jew88zu,t1_jew7kmx
From what I saw of Liverpool last Saturday arsenal will tear them apart.,Manchester City,Yes,jewk1rn,t1_jew7kmx
His defensive set up is extremely tight. Both the games that we won last season were 1-0,Manchester City,Yes,jeyzcdm,t1_jeyz6yn
"that would be satisfying tbh, but I would also like to see just how far we can push and overcome our limits in order to win a lot more CLs, but nonetheless I agree, just one would be enough",Manchester City,Yes,jeyz86e,t1_jeyxs8i
Yeah but still it's relatively better than this team,Manchester City,Yes,jeyod9n,t1_jeyh1mi
I don't even know who Oli is. Most random list of people I've seen grouped together to make a point.,Manchester City,Yes,jey8gcn,t1_jey6s3g
Pretty sure oli is the transphobic one,Manchester City,Yes,jeya2t3,t1_jey6s3g
"I personally agree with you. Mostly just throwing out who I think the pundits will talk about. 

Of course, if arsenal win it it‚Äôs an open and shut case. If they lose one game and then lose against us and we pip them to it, I still think it‚Äôs pretty much an open and shut case for arteta. Only way the others get in the mix is if they somehow begin to implode for the last two months, which seems very very unlikely (though I‚Äôd welcome it!)",Manchester City,Yes,jeza126,t1_jez9pow
"yes, agreed, but what Emery is doing is pretty damned impressive",Manchester City,Yes,jf37odg,t1_jez9pow
They were a possession based team before they won the league also no? It's just they were more direct,Manchester City,Yes,jf1j2j7,t1_jf16gwu

"If we so much as won half the games in which we scored first and then conceded stupid equalizers this season, we‚Äôd be ahead of Arsenal. 

Though I suppose we‚Äôve had our fair share of comebacks from 1-0 and 2-0 down. But nevertheless, I hate how often we‚Äôve thrown away advantageous positions this season.",Manchester City,Yes,jewkp7r,t1_jew8tpg
"Exactly and lost to Brentford at home. We should be winning all our remaining 10 games but this is football, and analysis is usually done in hindsight. Let's win the games before calling them easy though I'll be very confident going into all of them.",Manchester City,Yes,jew9fwj,t1_jew8tpg
If we make CL semis I don‚Äôt think we have a week off between now and the end of the season,Manchester City,Yes,jeyia5m,t1_jeygsfj
No clue I just typed it in lol,Manchester City,Yes,jeze2d2,t1_jey2l8e
"When he was playing for our academy, he will get frustrated whenever he gets subbed off. One time phil was coming on for him ,  phil offered him a high five and he refused lol. Soo petty",Manchester City,Yes,jew9p74,t1_jew98wp
"Back at Dortmund he‚Äôd be late for training because he‚Äôd spend too much time in London. Other than that though he hasn‚Äôt done much to suggest he has a bad attitude.

However I think after he burned City once - Pep was really keen on having him play pre-season - I doubt the management will accommodate him again.",Manchester City,Yes,jewki9l,t1_jew98wp
Yeah I think we're past the Sancho period now. Better to promote from within or find another young English target elsewhere.,Manchester City,Yes,jeze8jj,t1_jexxd00
Yep Liverpool result will decide the title,Manchester City,Yes,jew8h3o,t1_jew88zu
"I think our run in is incredibly tough. Basically everyone we are facing is fighting for something, either Europe, avoiding relegation or for the league title. Only Fulham away might not be fighting for something (they are very safe from the relegation zone, and I think out of the race for Europe) Chelsea at home might not be fighting for anything either, but a new manager might get them firing. 

Brighton and Brentford away are going to be very difficult games. So is Everton.",Manchester City,Yes,jexzs8g,t1_jew88zu
liverpool home and away are two different teams.,Manchester City,Yes,jewks9e,t1_jewk1rn

"Pleeeaaaasssee. So he did something when he was a kid, and suddenly his attitude stinks? He's not that kind of player currently, doesn't that count for anything? 

Grealish hasn't been happy about being subbed off many times under Pep, does his attitude stink too?

I know Sancho is a United player but let's go easy on the agendas.",Manchester City,Yes,jewajle,t1_jew9p74
"Yeah, going to Dortmund the way he did cut his ties with City, though I'll admit it was the best move for his career. On his wages, there's no space for him on the current squad, and we can always do better.",Manchester City,Yes,jewlqmh,t1_jewki9l
I don‚Äôt have my hopes up for Liverpool v Arsenal. Liverpool will be knackered playing a third game in eight days.,Manchester City,Yes,jewlg2o,t1_jew8h3o

"Idk man there were many reports criticising his attitude before the World Cup, then he took a break for like 2 months. I might be wrong but still it doesn't look good for him. I have no agendas against him. Idc enough about him to have an agenda.",Manchester City,Yes,jewgn42,t1_jewajle
they play Newcastle at St James.,Manchester City,Yes,jexzva6,t1_jexd09e

or Leeds,Manchester City,Yes,jexbj9p,t1_jewlu3f
"The break he took was approved by his manager to clear his head and work on his fitness levels, it's not like Sancho went AWOL. 

Ten Hag has always been open with his criticism of players who aren't giving enough in his squad. He's criticized Garnacho, Antony and even Rashford this season, and kicked Ronaldo out so I don't think Sancho will survive this long under him if he had attitude issues.

They guy is simply not good enough and I think it's better we just leave it at that rather than attributing it to having a bad attitude.",Manchester City,Yes,jewl8nx,t1_jewgn42

"If we aren‚Äôt winning the league then I prefer they cancel it. Next best option is anyone but a big 6 team winning. The best option after that is anyone but United. 

I don‚Äôt have the same respect for Arsenal as most of you do. Their manager learnt from Pep, and so did Jesus and Zinny. Their play style has been called Man City-esque by plenty of pundits. This isn‚Äôt a normal season either with both Chelsea and Liverpool playing like shit. I also think it is unfair to our team to say Arsenal are incredible and we were ‚Äúsubpar‚Äù in the first half when the gap is essentially 5 points if we win the game in hand. They have looked better because we focus more on City‚Äôs failures than theirs. If they don‚Äôt win the title they‚Äôll be trophy-less and wouldn‚Äôt have even appeared in a single final. We on the other hand are still on the hunt for three trophies, and one of them is a tier above theirs. 

I don‚Äôt really get the same feeling from Arsenal Vs City as I got from Liverpool Vs City, and Liverpool‚Äôs fans and squad are assholes but Klopp‚Äôs one of the best in the world. Would rather lose to a competent rival than someone else just because of the vibes.

This is what I was trying to convey.

I 'm not thinking anyone's going to be demoralised, just that they might have had Klopp's foot up their backsides and they'll still be stinging from the weekend and now more motivated  - and yes, I hope as you do they storm it at Stamford Bridge and then clobber Arsenal at Anfield; that is my 'secret' hope - so don't tell anyone!",Manchester City,Yes,jets9dn,t1_jetqotd

If we don't win the title, there will be a day or two of disappointment, followed by immense pride and joy in the performance this season.

That being said, I agree with the comment above yours that I think this squad really doesn't feel the pressure. Arteta has done an amazing job of instilling the ""All I care about is the next match"" mentality. We'll see if that holds when it gets really close towards the end of the season.

"

Klopp's Liverpool was always a good 'UCL contender'. Heck it even won one. Regardless of their current form, it is *still* the only club that can beat City any day. They were also invincible at their home for a long period. Their XI was better than our XI. But our squad depth, better midfield and Pep helped us in clutch scenarios. I cannot say the same about Arsenal. I don't think Liverpool would have lost in UEL. I don't think City would 'dream' about signing Arsenal players apart from Saka and (maybe?) Odegard. While Liverpool had better shotstopper, better defense, (probably) better wing backs, (definitely) better wingers. 

If you ask me which team I'd like to avoid facing in a tournament, it's them. Not saying that we're weaker than them, but they're the ones that helped us stay at the top of our game by giving us that fierce challenge. 

I would rather face this Arsenal than Bayern and R. Madrid. Liverpool is out of the question. 

A lot of Liverpool fans are losing hope in Klopp and their defense. Salah isn't getting any better either and their new signings aren't looking that promising (yet?) and they won't be playing UCL next season which will impact their transfers. This downfall can destroy the competition we have in the league, but I'm not sure if I should be totally happy about that because they have played a little role in keeping us the best club in the country in the last decade. 

Furthermore, Liverpool faced a UCL finalist Spurs and UCL winner Chelsea in the league while you're facing the worst Klopp Liverpool in years, the worst Chelsea and - the worst Manchester City in the last 6-7 years.

"If we're looking at it dry and 'scientifically' to try to put a % on it then I'd say it's probably higher than 30%, probably more like 40-50%.

We have the highest expected points in the league and we have generally performed in line with it. So that means we've pretty much picked up the points you'd expect based on the xG for and the xG against on a game by game basis.

Arsenal have the second highest expected points but their actual points total has over performed their xPoints by 11. 

That doesn't mean they'll automatically slip back, it just shows it's been pretty close between the two teams and without their big over performance we'd probably be on top.

We've got 30 points left to play for, based on past performance we can probably expect to land on somewhere between 85-90 points when the seasons over. That means Arsenal would need to pick up 13-18 points from 9 games.

Basically their gap isn't large enough that they can afford to be any worse than us. Yes City need to win 75% of the games to have a chance but if they drop anything below that then we'll pull ahead.

The fact that we haven't played them at the Etihad yet is what leaves it open too. If we beat them there then they'd probably need to win at least 5-6 out of the other 8 games which is tricky.

"I've been thinking for the past 10 years that Bayern has been underachieving, they've only won that last Champions League because of covid lmao, aside from that, they should always be contenders since they're in the same position as PSG where they don't have that much competition in their league. Please Pep, tear them apart.",Manchester City,Yes,jeo308c,t1_jenor35

I find it weird they kept saying they‚Äôll stick with him only to sack him this fast. Its like they know exactly who to switch to and don‚Äôt want to wait. So it could be Nagelsmann.,Manchester City,Yes,jep243w,t1_jep1me3
They are a non issue for us.,Manchester City,Yes,jep5b2t,t1_jep3v6n

We are beating nagglesman at bayern or Chelsea regardless. Non issue,Manchester City,Yes,jep5gv4,t1_jep49cn
"There's doubt about whether they can really pay him ridiculous money though. His pro contract was recently invalidated and he was forced back onto his youth deal because his wage put them over their salary limit. Right now he's probably only getting like ¬£2k per week on that old deal.

Even before I don't think his deal was completely silly money, think he was on like ¬£150-200k pw? Call it like ¬£8-10m each year for the next 3 years, so ¬£24-30m total plus any other bonuses.

I'm not saying I think he's likely to leave but I think there could be a possibility if someone is willing to test his resolve. I think there's a serious possibility he could get 3/4x as much money somewhere else.",Manchester City,Yes,jep29jz,t1_jeo744g

"Nah, you won't.  You just think you will. It's human nature. 

I've tried that with spurs and quickly reverted back to my normal state.",Manchester City,Yes,jepdolj,t1_jepavhd
"Pretty decent breakdown. I'd say I agree with you on the majority of your points. Besides our game against them, the only fixtures I'm looking at with a bit of hope that they might screw up are Chelsea and Newcastle. Chelsea because anything seems like it can happen in the London derbies, and Newcastle because, despite their poor recent form, I still back them to somehow pull a defensive masterclass out their asses all of a sudden.

Liverpool aren't gonna be a factor, judging by what we saw yesterday... and as for Brighton, I just think it's a case of two pretty similar teams playing against each other, except one is just straight-up better than the other.",Manchester City,Yes,jenot4l,t1_jenk7sf
A club like Brighton isn't going to take anyone's academy players on a dry loan. If he gets loaned out to any pl clubs it will be to a relegation threatened team or newly promoted side.,Manchester City,Yes,jen0phb,t1_jemwu6q

Huh, I thought I read somewhere he was on 700k a few years ago, if that's the case I would be delighted if he came, been a fan since his Ajax days and is one of my favorite players whenever he plays for the national team.

"Don't forget that playing against relegation battling teams at this stage of the season can be really tough too.

But you're right about that, they don't need a loan player for that role, especially with the cash they've got built up",Manchester City,Yes,jen730x,t1_jen0phb

Also we're doing a Japan and Korean tour apparently so it seems like fate


But I do think he has a mind that pep would love to coach",Manchester City,Yes,jepau18,t1_jepamnn
A reason why I say that is because Arsenal is being described as playing like us and not the other way around. Pep‚Äôs the thought leader here and the players are now executing his plan effectively with their individual flair.,Manchester City,Yes,jen3yy9,t1_jen27hc
"they've kept their form up in the league but crashed out of two other competitions in the last month or so, we're doing well in all three that we're still in. not sure ""more consistent"" still applies to them.",Manchester City,Yes,jeopd8u,t1_jen27hc
"Yeah, definitely not in the first half of the season because Arsenal were better. Now it‚Äôs us and Arsenal are one draw away (if we also beat them) from bottling it.",Manchester City,Yes,jen46es,t1_jen2cv2
"Nah Liverpool has this invincibility at anfield when playing big 6 teams. However, arsenal are finding a way every single game and Liverpool are TERRIBLE rn. That salah goal yesterday tho is some hope that arsenal can be caught out tho",Manchester City,Yes,jep8yb7,t1_jep1n8c
"Yeah, especially with low expectations and a huge talented squad. Nagelsmann will make things tough for everyone.",Manchester City,Yes,jep4ofq,t1_jep4540
"Sorry crossed wires, thought you meant Gavi.",Manchester City,Yes,jer79l6,t1_jepn7n9
In fairness undav barely plays. Mcatee would be a really nice fit for Brighton. They're loaning colwill currently so could be room for a mcatee loan next year. Reckon they'd be a nightmare to do a buy back or anything like that with though.,Manchester City,Yes,jen76b7,t1_jen261q
"true, both would be brilliant. would be delighted to get either",Manchester City,Yes,jepay4v,t1_jepau18

I like Wout but he's just not a starting caliber player for us. Rashy yesterday despite being beaten in most of his duels aerially (which let's be honest Wout isn't great at either) offered a lot. 

I think a fluid frontline works better for the team, having Rashford, Sancho and Antony worked. Despite them not interchanging much with one another, they all move about and don't give the ball away. With our midfield that's almost necessary, even with Case and Eriksen we give the ball away a lot so having wingers in particular who recycle the ball is key. 


Anyways, Martial is the best 9 in the squad and it'd be a big boost to see Rashy - Martial - Sancho/Antony and occasionally even Sancho as the 10 behind that front 3 as well. Could see that working nicely in some moments, also allows us to rest Bruno a tiny bit once Eriksen and Case are back. 

Sabi too is another option at the 10 as we saw yesterday. Just need players back and to stay fit and not get suspended for the run in now.

With a full squad we look pretty strong, Garnacho, Wout, Sancho or Antony on the bench is ok, and Fred and Sabi in midfield off the bench is also good. Even defensively having Maguire and Lindelof is alright despite their flaws they have useful qualities as subs if needed, same goes for our fullbacks.

"Interesting watching Martial yesterday. For all his layoffs and short passes, none of his teammates set him up for a shot... despite there being several opportunities to do so. 

Martial has literally played a handful of games, but even in those moments you could see his frustration at not receiving the ball in the box. For someone who has the best shot conversion out of all our forwards, it's a shame he's not the one taking the most shots. I really hope this changes as we need to share the goal scoring responsibilities. 

ü§ûü§ûhe stays fit. Having a striker and two (quality) midfielders back for the last stretch will be huge.

Shout out to Malacia as well. Those energy levels did not go unnoticed",Manchester United,No,jf680np,t3_12cn4ey
"Does anyone think Anthony can make it through an entire Premier League season without an assist?

Not many wingers in the league can do that, but he's on 0.71 XA in the league this season so he surely has a realistic chance at it with only 10 games left?",Manchester United,No,jf6j0gz,t3_12cn4ey
Sabitzer hasn't impressed me at all tbh. I know he got an assist yesterday but the rest of his game was again meh to say the least. There are moments of quality in him and that much is clear but he's another one of these moments player which I'm just sick of now. We have one too many of these sort and should be getting in players who can play good over the whole 90 minutes instead.,Manchester United,No,jf62jbn,t3_12cn4ey
"Maddison is getting heavily linked with Spurs now that he is approaching the last year on his contract. Maddison can play on the right and in Bruno‚Äôs position at a high level while providing many goals and assists. Despite the team having Diallo on loan, as well as a desperate need to make Sancho, and Antony work. None of these options have been convincing and at the moment we cannot risk an injury to Rashford or Bruno as our entire attack will diminish with one injury. Maddison provides us with much needed quality, is homegrown, and will allow our younger players to have the time they need to develop. 

I know these questions are usually associated with eye rolls about how this isn‚Äôt fifa, or that we need to prioritize funds in other positions, but this is a discussion thread so be open minded. Should this be an option the team looks at in case they fail to get the striker they want? If Bruno gets injured we currently will be playing Eriksen there who is better deeper, Van de beek who should be sold, or Sancho potentially who should be better on the wings. For a team like Manchester United this is shocking, and even Arsenal got a back up for Odegaard, and City have many options in case De Bruyne goes down. What do you guys think?",Manchester United,No,jf2q5kx,t3_12cn4ey
Weghorst stinks and some of our fans being ok with him staying in any capacity beyond this season shows the damage the Glazers have done and just how far the standards at the club have really fallen,Manchester United,No,jf2ihus,t3_12cn4ey

"Unpopular opinion maybe. Pellistri should be starting ahead of Anthony. Anthony brings nothing to the table, can‚Äôt beat his man, can‚Äôt cross, can‚Äôt score. Basically just another passion and work rate merchant.",Manchester United,No,jf31xc6,t3_12cn4ey

When was the last time our player scored a hat trick?,Manchester United,No,jf2pjmi,t3_12cn4ey
Yeah our issue right now is the midfield. We need Casemiro back to solidify our midfield and we need Eriksen to dictate play and help our creativity from deep. Eriksen is still top 5 assisters in the league despite missing a large chunk of the season now,Manchester United,Yes,jf2694a,t1_jf25se2

Martial‚Äôs fitness is definitely a contributing factor but it‚Äôs not like we couldn‚Äôt have started Sancho/Garnacho/Elanga - Rashford - Sancho/Antony/Elanga/Pellistri instead of using Weghorst every game.,Manchester United,Yes,jf2lbn5,t1_jf25ajx

"It‚Äôs all over social media. Some even went as far as comparing a video of keano shouting at Ronaldo when he tried a fancy finish and missed, then said if it‚Äôs today players they‚Äôd be crying mental health.

">what he did to the club,

I'd rather 7 of those interviews than those 7 goals these absolute bottle jobs served up against the scum.

Crazy how quickly those fanbase has forgotten about that whilst still being so obsessed with a past player.

"The Spurs game earlier in the year is the one that jumps out, more as an exception than an example. 

There‚Äôs a couple others in there I‚Äôm sure, but your point still stands. I think we‚Äôve been unlucky to have Case & Eriksen miss so many game accumulatively. The difference with them in or out of the starting 11 is night and day.",Manchester United,Yes,jf27ljk,t1_jf278iz

A cm, a gk and a striker transforms this team.",Manchester United,Yes,jf27pbz,t1_jf278iz
"It's not surprising at all, we simply lack the right midfielders for that. Most teams that are capable of dominating whole games have a midfield that sets the tempo. They slow the game down when they feel like it and then they quickly play some fast balls to surprise the opponent.

Nobody in our team does that. Maybe Eriksen to an extent, but both Bruno and Casemiro always look to pass the ball forwards instead of maybe taking a touch or two and slowing the game down.

Now that I think about it, we do have one player who often tries to calm the game down and that's Antony, but he is being criticized a lot for it because ""it kills our counter-attacks!""",Manchester United,Yes,jf27ylj,t1_jf278iz
Still not a good side in possession. This isn't a slight on ETH as it is his first season and he still doesn't have the players to do it.

Love the guy but I don't think he's cut out for the PL. He doesn't impose or even try to add any kind of physicality and that's a must in this league.

"More than that, the thing everyone isn't talking about is in terms of weaknesses, Bellingham is very similar to Pogba.

Definitely not press resistant. Ideally would play further up the pitch with little responsibility however not quick thinking enough to play a 10....not discipline enough to play an 8 in a double pivot.

I think whoever spends all that money on Bellingham will get an unpleasant surprise.",Manchester United,Yes,jf6cl4n,t1_jf5zw14

"It kind of depends. I've seen some wild comments about him which I do think are over the top. 

I also think he's mis-categorized as a player, he's best as an offensive presence and a lot of people seem to think he's a box to box. He often plays as the furthest forward player in Dortmunds midfield. Specifically when it's a midfield 3. 

He's a really really good player though. Especially for his age, so I think it's easy to overhype him a bit. I think Pedri and Musiala are a tiny bit better but Bellingham is class. 

I don't think he'd make sense for us though, not unless we totally revamp the midfield.",Manchester United,Yes,jf6iaoj,t1_jf6d0i9
"Overrated relates to his cost no doubt - ¬£100m+.

I always think with that, what would we say 5-10 years from now. Casemiro and Martinez were technically overpriced. In 5-10 years do I have an issue with the amount spent? I highly doubt it.

"I dont think he is overrated. I think he's absolutely elite at what he does - being an absolutely phenomenally physically gifted box-to-box player with good technical ability.

The reality is the Liverpool result was horrendous but freakish (6 goals in one half and 7 goals from 8 shots), we drew against Southampton which actually isn‚Äôt terrible given we had 10 men for 60mins and we had a bad result against Newcastle away from home. They are a good team. It happens.

Having him as Bruno's depth + and option a bit deeper makes more sense. Eriksen I think is seen as a deeper player by Ten Hag, he's rarely played him as a 10. 

That said, I think he'd have to be the 3rd midfielder we sign. I don't like the idea of going into the season without a new partner for Case, and I think we desperately need a younger back up to Case as well.

Ten Hag said early in his tenure that he'll need several transfer windows and pre-seasons to get us to title challenging levels. Hopefully we win the Europa League and then PL position doesn't matter too much. Need to be a short and long term attractive place to move for any player.,Manchester United,Yes,jf27l8l,t1_jf2694a

"If we start next season with Fred and McT both still on the roster, ETH/the Board have failed. 

We need to sell McT and make Sabitzer permanent. Honestly, we should be up 20m or so from this.

"I almost want Liverpool to spunk their summer budget on him, so we can see next season how disastrous Bellingham and Henderson/Fabinho/Milner is as a midfield.

"Honestly I think Sancho will only be able to truly shine once we actually get our shit together and are able to play real EtH football. Him in a Dusan Tadic type role would be absolutely devastating for the opposition. We just need a real striker and to get better at having the ball and actually controlling the match

The question is, if he doesn't pick up his performances soon, will he last long enough to play in a United side more fit for his skills as a player? Probably not",Manchester United,Yes,jf36uer,t1_jf32dt7

"If you had to pick Bellingham or the other two based solely on the attacking side, who would you pick?

Bellingham would come out last. He is Pogba. A problem rather than a solution. Not good enough to compete with the best offensive players but not disciplined enough to play further back so you revamp your midfield to suit him.

You want me to pay over ¬£100m for that?

I haven't even mentioned how often he gets caught in possession and isn't at least press resistant for that price. I think he will struggle with the speed of the prem. I can see him doing better in Spain though.",Manchester United,Yes,jf6lg2p,t1_jf6iaoj

"I think selling Wan and getting a modern day fullback is still needed, but of course a CM and ST are priorities first. Yes Wan has been pretty good this season, but getting a modern day fullback who is very decent on the ball going forward will let us implement Ten Hag's possession based style of play. It will bring the best of out Antony and we will start to see the team that Ten Hag is trying to build here.",Manchester United,Yes,jf6csw1,t1_jf664gz

Wrong positional depth though in this scenario we'd have 3 players for one spot and 3 for another. We'd be better off getting an actual dm to back up case and with our ffp we ain't signing 3 midfielders so it's either sabi or an actual dm,Manchester United,Yes,jf6q64n,t1_jf6pi0h
He ain't going to want to leave bayern to be in the same situation here where he barely plays. Besides we have a strict budget this season and that 20-25 mill could be the difference between getting our 1st choice options or 2nd choice,Manchester United,Yes,jf6pl7m,t1_jf6onyg

How‚Äôs Mason Mount been recently? Wasn‚Äôt he supposed to be the next big thing for Chelsea?,Manchester United,Yes,jf649lc,t1_jf63w35
Yes he's the one we should look at if we could (in terms of type of player). I would prefer Barella just as he's a bit younger but Kovacic is a great player. Also ik his parent club is Atletico but Joao Felix is just insaneeee.,Manchester United,Yes,jf6bt07,t1_jf63w35
I agree. This accounts for some  vague and IMO fake short term injury excuses. It's happened with Antony more than once.,Manchester United,Yes,jf6pkjm,t1_jf6dg30

"Don't get me wrong, I agree with you. I was trying to get to the fact that the team doesn't utilise him to his fullest. There was a moment in yesterdays game where the ball was cleared and Martial was able to control the ball, despite being so close to the touch line, holding off the defender and finding his teammate and building the attack from the opposition half. This is only his second game back and he's looking sharp. I'd just like to see him take more shots and his teammates need to facilitate that.",Manchester United,Yes,jf69p6l,t1_jf697ln

"I agree, but with his price tag, versatility, and quality, I thought he would be a good option. Bruno has played far too many games this season and I really hope we do something to address the load Rashford, and Bruno had to carry for us offensively this season.",Manchester United,Yes,jf31dkm,t1_jf2s18b
On paper he starts on the right for leicester,Manchester United,Yes,jf2zxnc,t1_jf2zquh
"We‚Äôve played Eriksen more forward many times this season and he‚Äôs been far more effective playing deeper where he can help us in our ball progression. You brought up Spurs when he‚Äôs changed considerably since then, and for Inter and Denmark he‚Äôs also played in deeper positions the last few years. Denmark play a very different system to us as well so I don‚Äôt know why that‚Äôs relevant. At Inter he was the deepest midfielder in the 3, and for Brentford and Denmark he played in the midfield 2 in their 3 at the back formation. 

As for Maddison, he‚Äôs had 11 starts just this season on the right of their 4-2-3-1 or 4-3-3. They play a fluid system but so do we with our players interchanging. 

Do you not think Maddison would be beneficial at all in that role? Especially for that price tag potentially?",Manchester United,Yes,jf30xa2,t1_jf2zquh
Antony was poor yesterday. His performance is being exaggerated because it was slightly better than the norm from him. Our standards are down the shitter,Manchester United,Yes,jf6ps9t,t1_jf699p2
Was a nice ball in too!,Manchester United,Yes,jf69o8o,t1_jf699p2

"I want to be patient with him. But in cut throat environments, if players don‚Äôt perform they get sat down and moved on. Pep not using grealish till he started playing well (and probably performing in training) for example. When they first signed mahrez he barely used him as well.

"It‚Äôs ridiculous how long midfield has been an issue for us and how long it‚Äôs not been addressed or we recruited a player who didn‚Äôt suit the role we required.

There are many good performances that shows what ETH can do and add to the fact there is a trophy as well. Not only that, we are in sf of fa cup and qf of EL where we still have good chances in both tournaments. Anyone expecting league this season was setting themeselves undue expectations. Anyone with any football knowledge could've seen how our quality in depth is lacking and still had holes in the XI. Add to the fact with the grueling fixtures, tiredness was gonna set in one way or another. I mean we saw it before the WC and before international break. Also, case and eriksen have been key players for us in the midfield and the drop in quality is huge, the performances lately was just a matter of time. 

We are in top 4 fight and that happens when you miss key players and don't have adequate replacements in place. But, expecting united to win every games is borderline delusion and not understanding what our squad lacks. The next two games will be very hard and the players need to put a real dog-fight otherwise we will lose those games as well. But, the fans need to be calm because this project is no where near complete.  Just have to be patient.

I really don‚Äôt think Kane is going to happen. There‚Äôs zero chance that Levy is going to sell him to United for ¬£80m. How much higher are we willing, and can we afford to go? I can‚Äôt see Spurs selling him for less than ¬£120m. 

As good as Kane is, that‚Äôs an insane amount of money for a 30 year old, and leaves us with very little to spend elsewhere. It already looks like we‚Äôre sacrificing getting a new keeper for the sake of other positions.

Midfield should be an equal priority. It‚Äôs a big issue for us, and we can‚Äôt be totally dependent on Casemiro. There‚Äôs no cheap solutions for a player that fits the De Jong profile.

Ferguson looks the real deal. He‚Äôs 18 and he ‚Äògets it‚Äô. He‚Äôs got a great football intelligence for his age. 4 goals and 2 assists in 11 appearances is a fantastic record for an 18 year old

The way people talk about him nowadays makes it sound like he was completely lost. He wasn't, he was just kinda limited and couldn't really coach possession patterns, but when you compare him to other managers that got big financial backing since (mainly Potter or Gerrard) then you can appreciate he actually did pretty well with us and it's not his fault he was ultimately more like a long-term interim option rather than someone to take us back on top.

Bruno has a penthouse rent free in that sub. People there complain about how he is with referees but forget that any captain worth their weight will always put pressure on the ref. Football 101.,Manchester United,Yes,jeytzvn,t1_jey5t8l
His contract expires 2024. But I think he‚Äôll be open to leaving due to Chelsea having 370 midfielders,Manchester United,Yes,jf0wfkj,t1_jf0cwvk
"Two midfielders (starting ball-progressor that makes Eriksen a backup and an understudy for Casemiro) remain a top priority, but so is GK and ST. We really have 4 priority positions right now and need to be strategic about how we fill those gaps. It does show how long and how much our midfield was neglected when you need to sign 4 of them over 2 summers (i.e. when you can't even rely on existing players to be backups to new starters).",Manchester United,Yes,jexumkc,t1_jexmb26
I think he is going to be too careful. It may slow him down a bit.,Manchester United,Yes,jexn5gy,t1_jexmb26

"Asking an 18 year old to lead the line (let's face it Martial's injury problems aren't gonna get much better) is a big one


Yes you'll definitely and rightfully mention Rooney but he had an established squad around him. Our attack is still very young - we need a spearhead like Kane.


I think we can get away with buying a younger, more raw midfielder though so that's how I'd allocate the funds personally.",Manchester United,Yes,jf1e64a,t1_jf1bdmp
You‚Äôre literally doing the same thing about Arsenal fans.,Manchester United,Yes,jexmj4v,t1_jexl96a

"That is an insane take. Can't stand Arsenal and their gooner fans but they've been the best team in the league.

"It‚Äôs been a very weird season for Arsenal- they‚Äôve been consistently excellent, which for them is weird af",Manchester United,Yes,jf0wip9,t1_jf02iyc
"Brighton will want massive money for him.

No way they're selling him for ¬£40-50m for example when they know they can develop him and sell for ¬£100-150m in another year.

But on our end we'd be insane to pay ¬£70m+ and build our attack around a guy who's scored 4 goals career goals in the PL.

I don't see how this deal can ever make sense financially for both parties.",Manchester United,Yes,jez5j1j,t1_jez131u
"Irish so he likely won't be qualifying for many international tournaments, so a United fan, seems the perfect transfer.",Manchester United,Yes,jez4ka3,t1_jez131u

"Same, it's surprising, but maybe not the most indicative of dribbling ability on its own. Because he scores well on progressive carries, successfully taking on defenders and not getting dispossessed. By eye test he looks to have very good dribbling ability though has been off form at times",Manchester United,Yes,jf1j7q1,t1_jf1h7ph
Sancho does pretty much nothing imo. Garnacho and Martial both offer more.,Manchester United,Yes,jf1hd3b,t1_jf1h7ph
Was also true in 1986,Manchester United,Yes,jey90ye,t1_jey8m6i

"Based on what though? Few games with no pressure.

Also, in what capacity within the team?",Manchester United,Yes,jeyd6t1,t1_jey8m6i
i think we will kill his development here if he isn't playing taht much.,Manchester United,Yes,jf0esz5,t1_jey8m6i
We would cook with enzo and kante in middle instead of fred/sabitzer and mctominay,Manchester United,Yes,jeyeui8,t1_jey4ltk

"Nah that‚Äôs 600M in 1 seasons, sounds even crazier than that",Manchester United,Yes,jf15fc4,t1_jf0iz2e
Our squad options are shit. First XI is still bomb though.,Manchester United,Yes,jeylsp9,t1_jeyist5
"Most likely based on the past 4 games and with international break we expected some reaction to the poor form shown before. We were outplayed by Liverpool, Fulham and now Newcastle",Manchester United,Yes,jf024j4,t1_jeyist5
"I think things are starting to click for Newcastle, we played them at the worst time, they went through a bad period but now I see Isak finally finding his place in that team, Botman is like the old VVD, sucks we caught em on a good day.",Manchester United,Yes,jez5npj,t1_jeyist5
"That's because we are shit. Loosing 7-0 to below average Liverpool, 4-0 to Brentford. Being at the same place in the league (50pts) as last season With the same amount of games played (27) shows exactly that.

Had liverpool and Chelsea not been so bad this season we would have been left to dust at 5th place.

The only silver lining so far has been a carabao cup which our recent rivals (city) has won multiple times. This shows exactly how far we are behind them.",Manchester United,Yes,jeypldy,t1_jeyist5
"We are severely missing Casemiro and Eriksen, and frankly Garnacho as well. We need them all for these crucial games.",Manchester United,Yes,jexx3jt,t1_jextxpa

"Agreed, especially the nearer we get to the summer transfer window. Surely we need to know the budget before we make buying/selling plans. And I think the budget would vary hugely depending on owner.",Manchester United,Yes,jez56hd,t1_jeyhmg0
United 5-0 Brentford pls,Manchester United,Yes,jf12y8i,t1_jf0wj1f
They only just bought him for 17m so there was never gonna be a bargain to be had with him in fairness.,Manchester United,Yes,jey5rfs,t1_jey2tee

Fees are like that for young promising players with long term contracts",Manchester United,Yes,jey9jno,t1_jey2tee
Ndidi is worse than Casemiro on the ball and is injury prone. I don‚Äôt think this is a good fit for our current team,Manchester United,Yes,jezl8vy,t1_jeyvet0
Got to say Arsenal really did well getting Trossard and Jorginho for depth in January. We could do with both of them,Manchester United,Yes,jf01q23,t1_jeyvet0
I'd vote for that spend. Add Henderson to the sell list though.,Manchester United,Yes,jez4rfw,t1_jeyvet0
Honestly don‚Äôt rate Ndidi at all as a ball playing midfielder which even our 6 in a possession based system would have to be. I like the look of Amrabat at Fiorentina and Ten Hag has already coached him at Utrecht,Manchester United,Yes,jf0waja,t1_jeyvet0
"Im not sold on sabitzer.

"They should in fact be delighted with the point if not the performance. Allison is too good for them currently, papering over cracks in how terribly they defend these days. Unlikely to do business with us but he'd be the ultimate DDG successor if he fancies a new challenge while they are starting a whole new rebuilding process.

That match reminded me of a bum fight. Both teams lacking any quality, plan or style of football, just brawling hoping for a break.",Manchester United,Yes,jez4zd5,t1_jez0kc3

"The Athletic's 2025 expose on Nagelsmann's sacking: ""Chelsea players called the young German ""√úter Z√∂rker"" behind his back and played Avril Lavigne's Sk8ter Boi in the dressing room to undermine his authority. 

There was also a growing feeling that Nagelsmann's third place finish and FA Cup was not a sufficient return on investment given the 3.3 billion pounds put into the squad over the past 18 months, though detractors will be quick to point out that that number is inflated by the 1.2 billion pound fee paid for Tammy Abraham, the latest in a long line of struggling high profile striker purchases at the Bridge, after Boehly ""simply forgot"" that the striker had a buyback clause in his Roma contract.""",Manchester United,Yes,jf16xw1,t1_jf0vkhc

Hasn't been incredible but hasn't played much. Been better than Fred and Mctominay would like to see how he does if given a run of games next to Case.,Manchester United,Yes,jf0tjwl,t1_jf0ltq5
Good player but not the kind of profile we need. So hasnt got any real opportunity to shine.,Manchester United,Yes,jf15m0f,t1_jf0ltq5
He‚Äôs been bang average. Not done anything massively wrong but not done much to impress either. I doubt he‚Äôs even better than fred so there‚Äôs really no point in keeping him around when we need a fred and eriksen upgrade anyway,Manchester United,Yes,jf0mfl3,t1_jf0ltq5
"He's had his moments and is much better than McTominay but I don't think he's shown anything extraordinary. If we had a complete squad, I'd love to keep him but right now he probably doesn't fit the profile we need. He's 29 our other CM/DM are 30, 31 and 31. At best, we could get 3-4 years out of him but we'd also find ourselves having to replace 3-4 midfielders at once, so I don't think we'd keep him unless we decide to sell Fred and McTominay",Manchester United,Yes,jf0mr98,t1_jf0ltq5
Realistically we need Kane/Osimhen & Thuram,Manchester United,Yes,jf1vq3s,t1_jf1m93p

"Villa is pushing for Europe, I doubt we can get him for reasonable price",Manchester United,Yes,jez3unr,t1_jeyscqm
He‚Äôs getting goals but I really don‚Äôt rate him.,Manchester United,Yes,jf18dk4,t1_jeyscqm
"Wouldn't be worth anything like what Villa would want for him.

PL teams don't need to sell.

And if you're going to get fucked over you might as well bring in someone like Kane who's definitely good enough.",Manchester United,Yes,jez68bv,t1_jeyscqm
He's about where he should be. Upper mid table,Manchester United,Yes,jf01vhh,t1_jeyscqm
"His finishing is still dross, has just scored more than he usually does. 
His all round game is usually very good though. 
Saw the game against Chelsea, if he and Jacob Ramsay had any composure to their game, they would have smashed Chelsea for 4.",Manchester United,Yes,jf0zxh1,t1_jeyscqm
"It‚Äôs about getting the right player.

For example, spending a modest amount on Malacia was a good move - a young, back-up LB.

Maybe we can do something similar for back-up DM.

For CF and CM, we‚Äôre looking to bring in top quality starters. They cost top money I‚Äôm afraid",Manchester United,Yes,jf0wa6a,t1_jf0h7fw
"Everyone says this when we fail a big transfer or he flops and moan about not making smart signings, but the minute they see shiny Oshimen/Kane their brains fall off

A big transfer has never worked for us, the most expensive ones that have worked are Bruno or Case which were around the 60mill/70mill ballpark.",Manchester United,Yes,jf0i60a,t1_jf0h7fw
"This was discussed on a good United podcast lately (Devils in the Details) and their counterpoint was that you need to sign players who improve the starting XI, and those don't come cheap. So buying cheap players wouldn't work as it would stall the progress of the team. Of course we don't want to overpay but realistically anyone who's good enough will be expensive, especially a new striker. 

They also frame it in terms of how many years we want to take to win the league ideally. This dictates who we should sign. If the answer is that we want to be title contenders in 2024-25 say, then it makes sense to sign a striker who's already world class, even at a high price. If we're intending to wait longer and take 2 or 3 more years to challenge, we'll risk guys like Casemiro, Eriksen, Varane, Bruno, Fred starting to decline and then we're facing another rebuild.",Manchester United,Yes,jf0wqlj,t1_jf0h7fw
"If you're spending 100m on 5 players in today's market, what you'll get is a bunch of unproven youngsters who are just as likely to flop hard under a high pressure environment with too much responsibility.",Manchester United,Yes,jf0iqth,t1_jf0h7fw

"We‚Äôll be fine even with sales. Rashford, Garnacho, shaw, AWB if still here, think Hannibal will be good enough as a squad player or is at least better than Mctominay. Sancho as you mentioned.

"You r seeing way too much into it.

Even ETH knows many players are t suited for possession based football.

Players like mctominay, Fred, Bruno(good with the ball but gives it away so many times), Rashford, lindelof, Maguire, De Gea, Weghorst, AWB aren't comfortable with the ball at their feet.

This is a team created by ole for counter attacking football which all the above players r good for.

Only Varane, Shaw n Dalot(to some extent) r good with the ball at their feet.

Eriksen, Casemiro, Licha n Antony arrived this season n have transformed this team.

ETH knows the problems that's y we play a low block n have rashford as our focal point in attack on LW(because rashford isn't comfortable playing as a striker).

What worries me more is Sancho. I expected Sancho to be like grealish but he is nowhere near him.

I didn't watch Sancho at Dortmund so far Sancho is an average player who plays well when the team does n is invisible when things aren't going well.

ETH can't be like Conte who throws his players under the bus.",Manchester United,Yes,jez87sr,t1_jez642g
Rubbish eh. And I bet we‚Äôre one of the most televised in the league. Really sucks trying to watch footie in the UK,Manchester United,Yes,jf0vqid,t1_jf0sk29

"Thing is, Ferguson won‚Äôt be cheap for us to buy. Contract to 2026, United tax, Brighton don‚Äôt need to sell, good striker prospect, nothing about him screams cheap buy. Transfermarkt might say 10m euro but the real price will be multitudes higher.

Similar to Hojlund, though Atalanta is in a considerably weaker negotiating position compared to Brighton, Hojlund has contract to 2027, still a very young prospect. 35-40m euro is likely.

Retegui would be the cheapest of the young striker trio.  But untested and already 23 (stretching the young part but this might not be so bad, not all development are linear, like Kane)",Manchester United,Yes,jezwygg,t1_jezgic2

"Sabitzer is only here on loan so I think we can reserve judgment till the end of the season. I feel so sorry for Donny because he never really got given a run of games in an established side. I think the most important thing is having new owners with competent recruitment that finds the best for the manager. 
My personal feeling would be to make a decision on Fred, Sabitzer and VdB at the end of the season, but go all out for at least one quality midfielder and then take a punt on someone like Aouar or Tielemans? Freebies üòÅ",Manchester United,Yes,jf8qcq2,t1_jf1jxza

"I don't mean offence by this, but who cares? I just don't get why people are bothered by what other fans are saying. I see comments complaining about r/soccer and other team's subs on daily basis. You may as well be complaining about the weather.

People are tribal but they're especially tribal when it comes to football. United were 'the big bad' in the Premier League decades. Why wouldn't we be? We dominated the league and consistently outspent most clubs. I'm sure plenty have seen our progress this season and were shitting themselves at the prospect of us getting back to that place. We've had a slip so they're jumping on it.

I would keep Fred for another season. We need him for depth and he has a contract until 2024 anyway. I also like AWB but if a new right back is coming I‚Äôd rather keep dalot. But most people on the sub seem to prefer wan bissaka over dalot.,Manchester United,Yes,jexo848,t1_jexn6en

"I agree that most of these players need to go at some point, but they can't all go this summer unless we sign massively.",Manchester United,Yes,jexxwpl,t1_jexn6en
"Personally, I'd sell Dalot over AWB. I would also probably keep Fred as an impact sub because he can be effective at pressing. Also, I would keep Martial and Donny because we won't get much money for them and if they fix their injuries, they could be important (especially Martial). Donny started having some good moments before someone twisted his knee so maybe he could still be a useful rotation midfielder.

Then there is the case of Henderson. A lot of people don't want him back, but I am kinda starting to want to see him play a few games under Ten Hag. I'd prefer Raya of course, but if we need to spend elsewhere then giving Henderson a proper chance might work out fairly well. After all, his passing stats, sweeping stats and number of crosses claimed seem to be pretty similar to Raya, he is just a worse shot-stopper. In the end, he might not be good enough and De Gea is definitely the better shot stopper out of them two, but Henderson is a modern keeper and he is already a part of our team so we wouldn't have to pay anything to bring him back and test him out.",Manchester United,Yes,jey9esu,t1_jexn6en

"I understand why De Gea prefers staying on his line because to be fair to him, he is elite at saving headers and his technique when facing them is maybe the best in the world.

As you say though, it doesn't really help the team and we should be looking elsewhere. I kinda understand his mentality and him prefering to stay on his line, each keeper has his own preferred way of goalkeeping and De Gea of course wants to rely on his biggest strenghts. If he was 20 then maybe he could be taught something new, but he is 32 right now so it's too late to change him.",Manchester United,Yes,jey7t29,t1_jexxk0f
"No doubt about that. But this is a constant theme that keeps hindering us. And claiming crosses is also a big one.  

As for the rest of the team. I think it's very clear any midfield combo that doesn't involve Casemiro is an average/above average one, especially defensively.",Manchester United,Yes,jexxcjj,t1_jexuh69
">An in form Man Utd would‚Äôve beaten their press to the extent that they‚Äôd have to change their approach after 20-30 mins.

Then again, you won't see in form Man Utd play with Sabitzer/Fred and McTominay in the midfield because they drag the midfield level down a lot. Combined with De Gea also being poor on the ball and the likes of Shaw, Martinez and Dalot are suddenly surrounded with players who don't really help them with the build-up. Unsurprisingly, they can't do it on their own.

I know Ten Hag wants us to play the same setup no matter the players, I know he doesn't want to change our formation and I do like and respect that (it's better in the long run compared to Ole choosing system and formation randomly in big games) but with our current midfield composition, we can't play the football Ten Hag wants us to play. We need more technical security there.

If Casemiro and Eriksen are still going to miss a few matches, then we should tweak our setup. Playing five at the back would be stupid, but I think we should try to add in one more midfielder and play 4-4-2 diamond with Fred-McTominay-Sabitzer midfield. Or maybe a variation of this, with even Sancho playing in the midfield as CM because while he is weak, he at least has the technique to keep the ball and pass between the lines while being pressed.

As frustrating as it is, Sabitzer is decent but not the best passer, Fred is too erratic positionally and McTominay hides from the ball, so taking two of them and pairing them with Bruno who loves to lose possession cheaply is just a recipe for a disaster. It might still work if we were capable of luring our opponent to press us high and we could then use our keeper to play medium-range passes to bypass the press, but De Gea of course can't do that.",Manchester United,Yes,jey8pkp,t1_jexuh69

"Weghorst would be good as a squad player if our team was capable of dominating possession and he could just come on the pitch to wreak some havoc in the box with his movement (which is actually really good).

He is useless in counter-attacks though.

This will be a crazy opinion, I warn everyone, but I feel like Weghorst would score a lot of goals for Man City because the role Haaland plays would suit him really well, just someone waiting in the box to finish chances. Ronaldo would have probably been pretty good there too.

We are still far from them though so we play more on the counter-attack and our striker needs to do a lot of work outside the box. Weghorst does have the stamina for it and maybe even first touch, but overall he isn't good enough.",Manchester United,Yes,jey7cmb,t1_jexteuv

"\> We were getting into pretty much every single semi-final we could have got into but we always ended up missing the edge when it mattered.

Because he made poor decisions a lot of times or was too slow to act. De Gea was running on two seasons of bad form but he still ditched Romero who was our cup keeper for that FA Cup semi final against Chelsea. It was ironic that De Gea got us knocked out there with his shoddy goalkeeping

The following season De Gea was again terrible but didn't try to integrate Henderson sooner. We were top of the table in Jan only to drop so many points because of shoddy goalkeeping once again (Everton, West Brom? a several others). Once De Gea left and Henderson took over and became first choice and we played so much better

Europa League final was the same story. For some reason he started his second choice goalkeeper even though he had no problem dropping Romero the previous year. Made no subs at all in normal time and fell right into Emery's trap. That was Villareal's first trophy in their history.

As for Sancho, I don't think it's complacency. I think the club just misprofiled him, just like with Donny. Sancho was a great creative player, but he was like an attacking midfielder playing wide. We already had/have Bruno for pretty much all the creative duties so Sancho is left with scraps and is forced to play more like Rashford which really isn't his game.

Then they'd lose out on about ¬£20-30m. Easily worth the risk when he could be worth ¬£150m in a years time and it's far more likely he's better next season than this even if he never becomes a proper top striker, which is definitely possible.

Even if he ends up scoring 10-15 league goals next season he'll be worth more than he is now.

> But if that sounds as unlikely to you as it does to me, then maybe he starts to look more worth the gamble

See the problem is we don't just need him to develop into a good PL striker. We need a world class striker.

The chance of his value increasing for Brighton is massive, but that isn't the same as the chance of him being good enough to start for United every week. There's far less risk for Brighton in keeping him another season than there is in us buying him in the hope he becomes world class.

For striker I think we will have to spend big or take a gamble, as that position is so rare and overpriced.

More generally, I think it's harder than people think to get the right transfers for where we want the team to get to all while not spending top whack.

That's about 5M per year.

Martial's wages are 13M per year (actually lower than this with the EL and this is only if he hits all his bonuses, which he probably wont)

Mate he has played 11 games, an average of 48 mins a game and never completed 90 mins once. 

What on earth are you talking about.

>No doubt the pressure is higher here at United,

Its not just higher, it might aswell be a total different sport.

>but the natural counterargument is that there's nothing to suggest he can't step up and perform.

There is though, the fact many many players over the years have failed to do so in this same situation. The fact he has basically got as little experience of pro level football as you can imagine. These are valid reasons to suggest he can't and won't step up for a club that needs to be challenging for league titles. 

>In fact he has stepped up for Brighton already.

Brighton. 11 games with 0 pressure to win. Or Manchester United, trying to win a league title, competing on all fronts for 4 trophies and its a disaster if any are lost.

>He was also one of Ireland's best threats against France, and I've no idea why he was hooked for Idah (who did fuck all).

Firstly International football is a horrendous metric. Secondly you speak of one game. Mctominay bagged 2 goals against Spain, shall we make him our main midfielder etc etc.

>Yeah look I wouldn't be disappointed if he was the only striker we signed,

Then your standards are on the floor, as low as this squads floor of performance. If we only signed him, when we literally have only Martial it's beyond pathetic and anybody who supports that deserves all the embarrassing performances we will have.

>but my preference would definitely be to get him and someone else 

This is the only way. First choice level striker and then a kid in the mould of this Ferguson or Hojlund etc etc would be acceptable. Anything less is criminal.

A guy who has performed at a higher level, for longer, more consistently and on track to lead his team to a league title in a respectable league is spoken about as a risk, but previously you mention you wouldn't be disappointed if we just signed Ferguson. Can you not see how silly that seems?

For the second midfielder we can take a bit more of a risk. Alex Scott has impressed for Bristol and shares very similar qualities to De Jong. Another option could be Andr√© from Fluminense.

Another aspect to this is I‚Äôm not sure people realize how attacking our 4231 is. With Bruno at CAM we‚Äôre pretty much playing with 4 attackers which is a lot. That‚Äôs a big reason why we struggle to gain control in midfield at times, and we look completely lost when Case is out. You can‚Äôt control the midfield when nobody is capable of intercepting and cutting out passes through the middle. Playing with minimum one or even two holding mids should be the norm. 

Signing that holding mid also frees up Eriksen to play as CAM and give Bruno much needed rotation. We defo don‚Äôt need any more 8s, I‚Äôm tired of midfielders who can‚Äôt defend and hold a position.",Manchester United,No,jew4bsb,t3_12aqho8

AWB on the other hand, has a couple of years left on his contract, has a lot to offer to a team that sits deep and he‚Äôs English. 

Money looks to be very tight and if we‚Äôre going to spend most of our budget on a striker, they‚Äôre going to have to make sacrifices.

When Ole finished 2nd with a weaker side than the one we have at the moment, people were quick to say things like ""ah, lucky season, sure look at how Liverpool fell off, that's how he got 2nd, just a lucky season"", yet here we are 3 points better off than we were in LAST season's absolute horror show, with that exact same excuse not being cashed in with Liverpool and Chelsea both having complete drop-offs which opened up the top 4 for us.

We still have a long way to go, and I hope ETH gets the backing he needs to really shape this squad into his image, clear out the deadwood etc, because we're still far off where we need to be and it could have been a very different season had Tuchel got his shit together and had Liverpool not dropped off as badly as they have.",Manchester United,No,jewlj8z,t3_12aqho8

For me, it's why Garnacho and Pellistri have looked good coming in because they offer direct pace against tired legs.

Until Garnacho returns along with Case and Eriksen I wonder if EtH will try Bruno in the 8 again with Sancho in the 10 if Martial can play as our 9 without injuring his feelings.

There needs to be a bug clear out this summer, beginning with De Gea, I have a lot of respect for what he has done for the club but De Gea for me partly symbolizes our mentality and fragility in this past decade. Too many players have been given second chances. 

It's time for a clear out Maguire/Lindelof, Fred/Scott, Awb/Dalot, De Gea need to go. Eriks signings mentality wise at least have been in the right direction, Anthony though has a lot to prove.

It's literally been a decade since we had midfield that could hold ball under pressure. Almost going back to Carrick and Scholes, although LVG era midfield was decent.

 We need to sign younger players again, 22-25 preferably to build a strong backbone.

A personal feeling is that this club needs a strong core of academy players for this club to succeed, both the dominant eras of this club had youth at its heart.

Their only goal has been the Champions League, but they're getting no closer. Make no mistake about it; these will be the same people running United. People point to City, but besides them both being oil-rich, that's where the similarities end.  
Speaking of City, they dominated the league, but now their credibility is at stake due to cheating accusations. If found guilty, would it be worth it? If found guilty, can we still call them a well-run club?  
It's also worth mentioning that our spending in the transfer market has on par with City's (much larger net spend), as well as having a much higher wage bill. That's not because of state ownership, but years of terrible management.

Liverpool have been neck-in-neck with City with no state funding. They also won the Champions League. Arsenal are on their way to win the league without oil money.

At the end of the day, it all comes down to having the right people behind the scenes and having the right manager. We can do that without Qatar.

"Unpopular opinion:

I don't quite see how Rashford fits into a Ten Hag league winning team.

He's got zero pressing work rate, he loses the ball a lot with poor passing to teammates, and he consistently chooses to shoot from terrible angles instead of cross to open players.

When we play against top 8 teams, they dominate their right side because Rashford doesn't track back and do the same work that Antony does to defend and win the ball. When Rashford is in peak form we get away with it because he scores a goal on the break, but top defences double team him as soon as he gets the ball and shut him out of the game.

He won us a lot of games in the middle of the season but his work rate and style is much more Ole ball than a Ten Hag system. 

I'd love to see us defend the middle of the park on the left as well as we do on the right (when we're doing it well).

"I find the idea that we can‚Äôt afford a GK, RB, CM, and a striker from an FFP perspective hard to believe. If we were good at squad building we should be able to raise 100M+ from sales. For example, we could sell all of one of AWB/Dalot, Sancho, Mctominay, Maguire, Henderson, telles, bailly, Elanga, Williams, etc with very little impact on our actual playing squad. 


Most of those don‚Äôt have great value but Maguire is a starting CB for England, mctominay and Henderson are useful, and Sancho is only 2 years removed from being just a tier below Mbappe/Haaland. Add another ~15-20M from the other lesser known guys in that group and I think you could easily get above 150M (in value, I know that isn‚Äôt cash coming in). 


But for FFP purposes, that should be plenty to cover a pretty big outlay on a striker (say 120M max for Osimhen), a midfielder (60M), a GK (30M), Frimpong or some other RB (40M?), and a backup left center back (15-20M). That‚Äôs something like a 270M spend, let‚Äôs say 150M in outgoings, net spend only 120M. 


I know cash is a problem for the glazers, but new owners are going to want to spend to make a mark. Even if they aren‚Äôt Qatar. So I really think a summer of (for example) Kane, premier league midfielder, and Frimpong (for example) is just not acceptable.",Manchester United,No,jeulotw,t3_12aqho8

Sure his price was big but he's actually a half decent player. 

What's annoys me the most is that Grealish stats and very similar to Antony and he gets a bunch of praise  because he made one run backtackle in a game. Antony does that every match but gets nothing.

Don't remember anything else. 

Different doesn't mean useful, playing without a right foot is different, does it really help him or us? Nope. 

Just makes him predictable. 

When he doesn't shy away and has the balls to use his right foot, then we'll revisit this topic. I've seen him literally gain a yard of space for a cross only to pull back and shoot with his left right at the defender inside the box.

So naturally the team should get someone that can play Casemiro's role defensively, while adding someone that can replace Eriksen and offer similar ball progression with more defensive stability. 

Don't see how that leaves room for Sabitzer and McTominay. I think keeping Fred makes sense, though. Especially when the team needs to play up higher Fred's pressing is valuable and it seems he's able to link up with players a lot better there.",Manchester United,Yes,jewad2v,t1_jew83pg

In Football nowadays you have to use every technique in the book to gain advantages. E.g. if someone tackles you in the opponent's penalty box and you don't go down, the ref probably won't call a penalty. In this case, in another timeline, if Kane doesn't go to the floor, knowing how incompetent the refs are, there is a possibility ref might only give a yellow or nothing.


Like in the case when Lamela hit Martial, if Martial went down, maybe Lamela gets a red (video below).

"There should be a big clearout, but there won‚Äôt be.

We‚Äôre already getting briefs that the budget will be tight this summer. I‚Äôve seen people say ¬£200m but I think even that‚Äôs ambitious.

We won‚Äôt get enough money from the players we sell on to replace them all.

- De Gea should move on but they‚Äôre offering him a new, lower contract because it‚Äôs cheaper than buying a replacement.

If he doesn‚Äôt sign his contract, he‚Äôs in his last year and I don‚Äôt see any big clubs being interested in him. Even if they‚Äôre reduced, he‚Äôs on huge wages and no big club will want him for the same reasons we want rid.

- Maguire/ Lindelof; unless we get a big offer for Maguire, I don‚Äôt see us selling a cb. We need two centre backs as back-up, especially with Varane. If we sell one of these two, they need replacing.

- Same problem with Scott/ Fred. They‚Äôd need replacements. Scott could get a decent enough fee but Fred is in the last year of his contract.

I think we‚Äôll sell AWB because he‚Äôll get a half-decent fee (young, English, plays well in a low block)",Manchester United,Yes,jewkgf6,t1_jewb5l6

I‚Äôd personally let Elanga go as I don‚Äôt think he will make it. Let sabitzer and weghorst contracts expire. Martial should be gone, made from paper mache.

Maybe he's a bit too much of an attacking midfielder, though. He's been playing deeper for Feyenoord, but it is the Eredivisie. Defensively he isn't really what I would prefer next to Casemiro. But in terms of ball progression, it could work out really well. He can carry it forward, but especially his passing is great in my opinion. Some say he loses the ball too often, but that's statistical nonsense because of the way that's counted.

Shaw and Rashford have the correct partnership after playing together for so long. Sancho doesn't have the chemistry with Shaw or Malacia nor does Antony + AWB/Dalot for that matter. 


I think ETH is trying to use Sancho and Malacia together to build chemistry but Sancho keeps ignoring his overlaps which hopefully changes in the future.


Fitness wise, he should get his tonsils removed as tonsillitis keeps cropping up which might affect him. His physicality and stamina levels can't kept up with PL intensity, more training is needed.


He'll get there imo, it'll just take time. Once ETH gets more signings that suit his system, every player will look better. More control = more energy to attack.

Antony I agree shouldn‚Äôt be criticized too much, it‚Äôs his first season and he has shown good moments.

Bruno is in the same boat. He‚Äôs played an insane amount of football and has performed well. The only other player with goal in double digits.

Sabitzer was an emergency loan after Eriksen got injured so expectations are low.

We paid ¬£100m Anthony and he hasn‚Äôt scored in the league in 15 games and hasn‚Äôt got a single assist.

"Because people are looking at the bigger picture rather than just a few minutes of football

Rashford and Bruno have built up an incredible amount of goodwill with their performances this season - fans can forgive bad games here & there

But Anthony? Incredibly disappointing. 1 assist in over 30 games for us... 0.62 XA created in the league this season... 3 goals against non-championship opposition in nearly 6 months... He has had an incredibly disappointing start to his career with us and needs to improve - massively - and quickly

Sancho has been even worse than Anthony.

Sabitzer is very new and the jury is still out on him - he hasn't played enough bad games to really attract huge criticism yet - but it's coming if he doesn't improve - see Exhibit A:Wout Weghorst

Dalot was incredible for us - one of the best right backs in world football up to the world cup (benching even Cancelo for Portugal) , so again has built up some goodwill - goodwill that he is rapidly burning through with his post-world cup performances

I feel the problem with DDG is just that his style of play has just been moved past. He's an excellent shot stopper and has saved our behind on multiple occasions, but being a shot stopper is not enough in this modern age where goalies need to be good on the ball and act as a sweeping CB essentially.

But it doesn't mean he is the worst goalkeeper in the league, not by a long shot. There are at least 3 who are significantly worse and that's why their teams are in the relegation zone. He's definitely better than Lloris and Kepa at any rate",Manchester United,Yes,jevnxqa,t1_jeumm0k

">He is statistically one of the worst keepers in the PL this season.

His stats are still better than De Gea's though.... and his stats were negatively impacted a lot by Nottingham Forest pretty much buying a full new squad before this season and it took them some time to get settled. They were dogshit overall at the beginning of the season and they had 1 win after first 11 matches with most of their results being bad losses thanks to, in part, a terrible defensive organization.

Overall, when you compare Henderson and Raya this season then aside from shot-stopping where Raya has much better stats, they seem quite similar so if we can't buy a keeper, Henderson might do the job, at least until we find someone better.

>He is nowhere near good enough, I'd rather stick with DDG and I really want rid of him

De Gea is definitely the better shot-stopper but we can't play a modern system with him in goal. Henderson might not be the long term solution, but at the very least he could be a short-term fix.

>He fucked United off and doesn't have the talent to back up his ego.

Ego, fucked United off.... I see this a lot, maybe it's not wrong, but people keep missing the massive elephant in the room that he was a rising goalkeeper star, pretty much the best keeper in each competition he got loaned into and even was one of the best keepers in the Prem when Sheffield United were chasing top6 straight after promotion.

The end was toxic, he was at fault for it, but we wasted two years of his development by having him sit on the bench with a promise that ""maybe in the future you will be the number 1"". He turned down good loans because Ole told him he will be his number 1 and the end result was that he just never played and was just wasting important development years on our bench.

The way he left was ugly, but I can't blame him. Nobody with some kind of empathy should blame him because the club mishandled him and considering he was more than good enough to start for most Prem clubs at one point while still not being at the peak of his potential, it makes sense why he forced a loan.

Look at Courtois at Chelsea. Exact same situation. He was being loaned to different clubs but then he got fed up and told Chelsea that either they recall him and play him, or he'll force a move away. Chelsea did the sensible thing and moved ƒåech to the bench so that the younger keeper with good potential can play instead. Nobody at our club had the balls to do that with De Gea and so we're still stuck with someone who would maybe be the best keeper in the world in the 70s, but who is far from the level a keeper of a modern top club should be.",Manchester United,Yes,jetyc18,t1_jeti9n8

Yes Rashford's been great at scoring in the middle of the season but we've conceded lots.

"Well it is simply because of the decision making being terrible more than anything. Almost all the choices he made yesterday were wrong.

Eventually we just have to accept that he isn't cut out for it. At least VDB had the excuse of not getting to start games or mostly playing in rotated squads.

>Imo this season was about improving how we play and it's an inarguable success on that front even despite the humiliations like 7-0 etc

Really looks like we have improved how we play with some of these atrocious performances. End of the day, as it always come down to, if your players aren't good enough it doesn't work.

"Yeah if only he could play behind Haaland against teams who defend 60 yards from goal with two full backs who make Dani Alves look defensive minded.

How do you think Grealish would do play for Dortmund in those circumstances?

Half of the Bundesliga is championship level and the teams barely even try and defend. Teams in the PL are far better and far more defensively solid. So many of his assists were just passing a ball into 40 yards of space for Haaland to run onto it was insane. That scenario is just never going to occur in the PL

He hasn‚Äôt be able to dribble past any PL full backs since the day he got here. Why would that magically change? Playing in a better team doesn‚Äôt make you a better 1v1 dribbler. It‚Äôs something where you‚Äôve either got it or you don‚Äôt.

Case is one of the fixes to our issues and Eriksen should be back soon.   We still need at the minimum 3 midfielders. Maybe even 4 if Sabitzer doesn‚Äôt return and if McTominay leaves    A new striker and a new keeper.

"You could make comments like that for just about everyone, though.

For example, simplifying Bruno's errors like you did sounds fine (""mostly from poor execution"").  But when you look back, Bruno kept playing very deep, and players would run off him into more advanced position when he'd get the ball.  He *repeatedly* gave the ball away, though, which meant we were time-after-time being put on the defensive right after players sprinted to transition, leaving us short on numbers and defending a counterattack.

>Top 4 does not mean nothing to us as it gets us into the champions league. Otherwise we‚Äôd have to win the Europa which isn‚Äôt straightforward. Ten Hag has said the same.

And the champions league gets us what?

Ten hag has also said 'trophies are success' so you can't have it both ways. My whole point is based on what success is. That isn't top 4 and that is trophies.

>You asked on a post specifically about the league ‚Äúis that the goal though?‚Äù implying top 4 in the league wasn‚Äôt enough.

Nope, I implied nothing of the sort. It was about 'manchester united' 'season' that isn't restricted to 38 games, just as 'success' isn't. So I'd rather you not try to slide in pedantics to discredit my point.

Come on now mate, at least have some self awareness when you are criticising peoples points. Will you tell your grandkids about how 'we improved our style of play in the 22/23 season'?

It's a trophy, it's success. The manager says so, the history of the club says so. So yeah, when discussing manchester uniteds history years down the line and we get to 22/23 I'll be mentioning we had some success. End of the trophy drought, signs of genuine positivity etc etc.

>So what success is possible? We can't win the league or any meaningful trophy. You can pretend to care about the Europa if you want, I don't. Success has to be measured in terms of play

Erik Ten Hag says success is trophies. So if you disagree with him then fair enough but I support those words and believe those words and much more in line with what this club is about that 'style of play' we aren't arsenal.

Europa League. Valid trophy and also gains access to what people bang on about being a positive to the 'top 4' (which may I add is what the OP was suggesting is 'success')

Fa Cup, part of this clubs most impressive achievement. To degrade that as a 'banter' cup is not only disrespecting the clubs history but it shows you don't value one of the most important events in this clubs history. Not sure how you can be a fan and do that in all seriousness mate.

So I'd like to hear your ideas on why ten hag is wrong and why top 4 is success?

We were doing, but these performances have been creeping in as of late and the 7-0 is as embarrassing as we have ever had. That can't be disregarded.

"Completely disagree with your opinion mate - I literally couldn‚Äôt disagree with you more strongly about (a) Kane not being a fantastic signing or (b) Kane being a ""Woodward"" signing

He's a 200m player, easily - the guy is just sheer class - a pure, unadulterated, world class goal machine - has been for years, and will be for years to come

The list of reasons why he makes so much sense for us goes on and on and on...

\- Less than 12 months left on his contract come the summer reducing his transfer value? Check 

\- Wage budget free'd up from Ronaldo move? Check

\- Has shown he is determined to get out of Spurs? Check

\- One of a very small handful of players who can be considered the best #9 in world football? Check

\- Doesn't rely on pace giving him much better longevity? Check

\- Insane fitness record & physical endurance (Starting over 100 consecutive PL games for Spurs at the time of writing)? Check

\- Absolutely ravenous hungry for trophies? Check

\- City can't sign him due to Haaland? Check

\- Liverpool can't sign him due to Nunez/Salah? Check

\- Arsenal can't sign him due to NLD? Check

\- Chelsea can‚Äôt sign him due to Nkunku, Broja & an already bursting 8-year FFP amortisation schedule? Check

\- Spurs already have a replacement on board in Richarlison to prepare for selling Kane this summer? Check

Kane is literally our dream signing in the summer - and we now have effectively zero domestic competition for his signature (bar Newcastle, which seems unlikely) 

He won't go to Germany to pick up tin pot bundesliga medals with Bayern, or the French amateur postmen's society league to collect meaningless Ligue 1 medals with Paris Saint Qatar.

From what I've seen, any misguided utd fans (like yourself evidently) who aren't on board with Kane as a summer signing generally have at least one of the following as their reservations:

(1) Kane is just too old:

The days of 30 signalling the end for players are long since behind us

If we had gotten the likes of Zlatan, Henrik Larsson or Didier Drogba on our books the day they turned 30 they would be close to club legends at this stage

If we'd gotten Jamie Vardy on his 30th birthday we'd have had 5 of his best seasons

Ronaldo, Messi, Lewandoski all regularly scored 30+ goals a season from the age of 30 onwards...

Lewa also had his best ever goalscoring season at 32 (and his 3x best seasons were at 31,32 & 33)

Kane will be no different provided he avoids a catastrophic injury - and will be hungry to finally win the Premier League and Champions League, which he can do if joins us

Ronaldo was second top Premier League scorer at 37...

As much of a wanker as he undoubtedly is now - If we had signed Ronaldo 8 years ago the last decade would have been VERY different

Players who decline at 30 typically either don‚Äôt look after themselves and are unprofessional off the pitch (E.g. Rooney), rely heavily on pace (E.g. Henry) or both (E.g. Ronaldinho) - obviously that is just not the case with the goalscoring animal that is Harry Kane 

(2) Kane is just too expensive

The interesting one

His contract will have less than 12 months in July - Levy ain't letting Kane go for free - when City came in with the ¬£100m two years ago he will have said ""I can turn down ¬£100m now, get two more years out of him, then still sell him for ¬£80m-ish in summer 2023""

¬£80m is the ballpark he'll be available for - Maybe ¬£75m, maybe ¬£90m - but even ¬£125m for a 200m player will be delivering anywhere up to 5-7 years of goals is an absolute bargain

(3) Kane is out of our league as a signing

Make no mistake - with Kane in the #7 shirt playing as the attacking focal point in an ETH team - we are challenging for leagues & champions leagues

Spurs don‚Äôt usually splash out Richarlison‚Äôs level of fee on anything other than regular starters, so I think (and/or hope) him replacing Kane is inadvertently going to help us get back towards where we belong challenging for leagues & champions leagues

And remember mate - Bayern (or PSG, or any other European club) can't offer Kane Shearer's record, which is surely amongst his 3x remaining career goals! (Win the PL, win the CL, take Shearer's record)

- We still had City, Liverpool, Arsenal all to play away at this league stage last year (as well as Spurs and Chelsea). No such games of the former left this season.

- We lost 6 of those last 11 games which is what rubber stamped it as a completely shitty league campaign. We‚Äôll hopefully not be quite as bad this year.

"Im not surprised to see us drop in quality now that it‚Äôs April. Injuries and suspensions are taking their toll on us. I‚Äôm happy with either 3rd/4th tbh after last season. Another cup would be icing on the cake to improve the culture at the club 

At this point in time, it‚Äôs quite clear we need to improve the squad more. Our ball progression without Casemiro or Eriksen is appalling. Ten Hag is obsessed with Frenkie cause he can drop into the 6 and play out from the back and at the same time play as an 8. Eriksen is too weak to play facing his own goal, while Frenkie has the ability to evade pressure and turn to drive forward. We need someone like him for next season for whenever Casemiro is out. Sabitzer is definitely an improvement over McTominay. Depth for the pivot would be New 8/Casemiro/Eriksen/Sabitzer/Fred. Once Fred‚Äôs deal is done, replace with someone 
of better quality. 


Alongside a midfielder signing, obviously striker is at the top of the list. Kane, Osimhen, whoever Ten Hag wants, get him in. Beyond these 2 signings that would become automatic starters, we need to sell players that aren‚Äôt good enough and replace them with players who Ten Hag can actually utilize. Maguire and Elanga are the obvious two who can go, possibly Martial and Donny too but i doubt anyone would want them other than on loan. If they‚Äôre happy to be last choice, let them stay until we can offload i guess. We don‚Äôt need to replace these 2-4 guys with world record fee players.

"We are struggling in attack a lot and most of our attackers seem poor, but I feel like the likes of Sancho, Antony and even Weghorst would offer much more if our midfield wasn't so shit at keeping possession.

Without Casemiro and Eriksen, we once again have no midfield. Our midfielders don't win the ball so our defense gets exposed and our midfielders can't really get the ball forwards either so most of our attackers don't get into any ""simple"" situations and they have to pull magic out of their arse to contribute. That's just not sustainable.

I'm not really sure what the solution is though. Right now, Eriksen is still out and Casemiro will still miss a few matches. I'm afraid Ten Hag has to experiment with our formation to give us at least something of a midfield control otherwise we'll continue struggling to score.

People will of course point at City or Arsenal attackers to prove a point, but aside from Haaland and to an extent Saka, I don't think their attackers are particularly better than our attackers. However, our attackers get starved from the ball too easily so they just don't really contribute and therefore look shit in the end. Then again, if we had Mahrez on the right and Martinelli on the left then we would still struggle the same while I think Sancho at City or Antony at Arsenal would be playing well.

Like, look at Weghorst. Yesterday he completed 4 passes, we can say he was shit, but how many times did he get an opportunity to make a pass without two center-backs hanging onto him? How many times overall does he get an easy chance in the box to finish? He does have some misses from close range, but most of them are result of him finding the ball from difficult position and then failing to convert, which is what a big chunk of Cavani's career looked. Of course Weghorst isn't anywhere close to being as Cavani, but his movement in the box is good and he isn't a bad finishers, he just never really gets simple tap-ins or chances in the box because we can't get the ball there on a regular basis.

The unfortunate truth is that our midfield control took a hit when Eriksen got injured and our midfield then crumbled completely once Casemiro got suspended. We would need prime Messi in our attack to be dangerous on a regular basis and even then I'd imagine he would struggle to influence games with a double pivot of two of Sabitzer/Fred/McTominay and with Bruno being exposed heavily due to us being bad in possession.",Manchester United,No,jet0f65,t3_129ssva

Yes Eriksen has been out for a while and Casemiro as well(through no fault but his own) but it seemed that our squad players like AWB, Fred, McTom had improved under him.

Ten hag is still in his first season with players that don‚Äôt fit his style of play. He‚Äôs already secured us a trophy, got some great performances from the lads and got us into the top four race before the wc. I wouldn‚Äôt have believed that at the beginning of the season. He‚Äôs had a fuck ton of off-field issues to deal with and, in my opinion, has done exceptionally well. Brought back a discipline that was missing at the club, since the days of SAF and that in itself is an achievement. 

We‚Äôre still in the early stages of a re-build, playing a ridiculous amount of games with players we all know aren‚Äôt cut (not excusing it but injuries and suspensions haven‚Äôt helped). We‚Äôve seen improvements in certain players whilst the ones brought in have settled well. With better strength in depth, which will be almost every position (bar wingers) over the next couple of seasons, whilst ridding the deadwood, I see us pushing more with ten hag.

Hypothetically speaking, if we had a choice the opportunity to sign the next Hazard (the Chelsea one not the RM one) who could lead us to the title, would many people here accept potentially benching Rashford or letting him leave if he wanted to go? I'm not actually calling for him to be sold or saying that he sucks because he's obviously been very good this season and won us many games but it's food for thought. I guess that's how many RM fans felt in 2014 when Di Maria was sold yet they managed to win 3 UCL and the league in the following 4 seasons. We saw the same thing here too when Fergie got rid of RVN and we went on to win 3 in a row including the CL

 Well, my take on the game and United in general is that the problem at United isn't a lack of quality or poor tactics, it's a mentality issue. Some of our players seem to get complacent quite easily, struggle sometimes to get motivated and can't handle when things don't go their way. The Liverpool game was a prime example.

What I absolutely cannot fathom is people watching him play week in week out and not understanding why others might not rate him quite as highly as they do themselves

Me thinking his top level is as a talismanic player for a team that finishes around where he we finish (which by the way is nowhere near good enough for a club of our size) puts him in comfortably in the top 0.1% of professional footballers or something like that, but because I don't put him in the top 0.01% I get people telling me to fuck off, calling me an idiot, and even someone going through my post history to bring up non football related stuff merely because I think a player who's never competed at the top level at 28 won't compete at the top level based on how massively inconsistent he is, which comes with the territory of being a high risk player",Manchester United,No,jeos23f,t3_129ssva

"Sancho is a playmaker who's at his best when he's linking up with players and has opportunities to create chances for the forward. There was literally a graphic posted I think yesterday that showed he was one of the most creative players in the prem. It's why he was so lethal with Haaland and why he looked so good with Martial in preseason. You even saw some moments in the second half of last year with Ronaldo. You remove that number 9 and he's not an effective player since he isn't the fastest or the most physical. To compound our issues, we lack midfielders who can constantly feed the ball to the forwards. Take out Casemiro and Eriksen and we end up having a massive disconnect getting the ball to the final third.

If you put a player like Osimhen or Kane who can receive the ball in those areas that Weghorst struggles with you'll see vast improvements. Also getting Eriksen back solves a lot of our midfield problems so forwards should get more service",Manchester United,Yes,jeotby5,t1_jeoqicu
"I'm so gutted with how it's going, pogba 2.0 vibes.",Manchester United,Yes,jeor332,t1_jeoqicu

"In October I ran a half marathon and rushed home to see United lose to City after the international break.

I just have no idea why when the team plays collectively shit McTominay is the one that‚Äôs gets absolutely blasted every single time,Manchester United,Yes,jeqdp85,t1_jep5vcj
A harsh reality check. I should've seen this coming with the performances in last PL games. We were doing well in EL that I pretended it was well in the pl. We will now start facing stronger teams in EL and its gonna show whether the players will really work hard to show their efforts or just lose everything they worked so hard for in the last few months.,Manchester United,Yes,jeph7ow,t1_jepdphf

"it goes back to the issue this squad has had for ages now where they just seem to spontaneously stop trying. I guess when the team has had such a lazy mentality for so long, it can't be truly broken in less than a season but it's still frustrating to see after they've shown how hard they can fight too.",Manchester United,Yes,jepi1r6,t1_jepfndp
"Even if everyone gave 110% effort, we would still lose because our depth players cannot handle their roles",Manchester United,Yes,jepouw8,t1_jepfndp
This game was pretty much exactly the same as the cup final except we punished them on the day.,Manchester United,Yes,jepl310,t1_jepfndp
"Might be time to accept the fact he‚Äôs just not a United player. No tenacity at all, no desire, aggression, bravery, energy. All hallmarks of a United winger. Probably a nice chap but he just isn‚Äôt built for the United badge and the pressure that comes with. To be fair, I‚Äôm sure most players aren‚Äôt.",Manchester United,Yes,jep6uql,t1_jep5kqi
"Sancho is just a shite Jesse Lingard 

The lack of physicality and pace make him so bad",Manchester United,Yes,jep70w2,t1_jep5kqi
"I wanna see him succeed but it's mad how easily he loses possession. Even Amad against championship players holds possession better, and worst case scenario he uses his body to shield the ball and win a foul. 

-

Wingers who lack physicality do this all the time.. i hate how easy grealish goes down but he does it due to his lack of physicality.. Even Antony does it too at times


 Sancho neither muscles players off the ball, nor shields it to win a foul.. he just gives it away and it's frustrating to watch",Manchester United,Yes,jep74ew,t1_jep5kqi
"Happy birthday. I remember being really drunk on my birthday year's ago, checked the score and we were losing to Newcastle, checked again and it was like 6-1. Shame you didn't get that today.

"The Arsenal game was especially bad, Saka had free dribble into the box like 10 times, our guy was just letting him do whatever, he was afraid to force him out more to the side or tackle.",Manchester United,Yes,jepcmxm,t1_jep91uq
"To be fair, he spent a large part of the game pretty alone on the left side in defense. Rashford was staying forward and Bruno was the on the left of the pivot in the first half. Felt he was hung out to dry a bit.",Manchester United,Yes,jeq3l02,t1_jep91uq
Fair question but so much of our loss today was down to just poor application. Rashford just let Trippier do whatever he wanted.,Manchester United,Yes,jeorre7,t1_jeor0ki
Modern football all stems from a holding mid. Newcastle had theirs and we didn't. If we had a passable dm today the result might've been different. Only say might because it didn't seem like any of our players were actually up for it,Manchester United,Yes,jeosk1v,t1_jeor0ki
"You can't question our manager being completely dependent on one player, it's not allowed. Just blindly back him on every single thing instead",Manchester United,Yes,jeot3ai,t1_jeor0ki
"Unfortunate he didn‚Äôt get much time on the ball, we were stuck in our own half for much of the time he played. But yeah, hoping Martial can stay fit with the time he‚Äôs had off, Weghorst can‚Äôt be regularly starting for us.",Manchester United,Yes,jeorrwi,t1_jeord8o
Once those two are back in the swing of things along with Martial we can finally be playing with the team at full power,Manchester United,Yes,jeoxsrj,t1_jeoxkf0

Don‚Äôt know why Malacia doesn‚Äôt get more games. Shaw struggles in games like this,Manchester United,Yes,jept5k3,t1_jepk3l8

Antony is gash. Makes me want to turn off the TV,Manchester United,Yes,jeq26ju,t1_jepl085
I think sabi was being played in the wrong position and you are always going to look bad next to McT. With Martial coming in as a sub hopefully he'll start most of our games instead of Wout. He was alright when he came in tbf.,Manchester United,Yes,jeqtach,t1_jepl085
He should have been taken off at half time today,Manchester United,Yes,jepzoez,t1_jepfjyr

"So so true. The truth is this fanbase is so used to horrendous football that decent players are given so much shine. One of the reasons why fans of other teams are generally never impressed with us is because we actually aren't that impressive. We have so many players that are not good enough but you'll get downvoted to hell if you bring it up, because hey we just won 4 games in a row so shut up!",Manchester United,Yes,jer400i,t1_jer1e1a
There was a nice video by tifo - it is actually a way to beat press by not committing to one side of the pitch and allowing the other team to press that side heavily,Manchester United,Yes,jeqqe2g,t1_jeq5f2s
Get out of here with your rational thinking.,Manchester United,Yes,jep7z2n,t1_jeoycx1
"Agree with this, we need to resolve the issues about getting the ball to the striker in the final third first before actually addressing the goal scoring issue. Is it sustainable to rely on one goal scorer, absolutely not but if you can‚Äôt even get the ball out to the striker consistently the what‚Äôs the point.",Manchester United,Yes,jes7vzd,t1_jere3i0
"Opposition fans would love if he signed a contract more than united fans would, says it all really",Manchester United,Yes,jep7mnd,t1_jep6q14
That one clearance  Pope did when we pressed him which ended up being a quick counterattack is one of the many key things we're missing,Manchester United,Yes,jepc1cd,t1_jep6q14
You could do the same for all the players this place loves. Opposition fans don't rate Shaw and Bruno highly at all but you speak against them here at all and you're public enemy number one. Same goes with the manager. Lots of opposition fans don't rate Ten Hag,Manchester United,Yes,jeq7osb,t1_jep6q14
"Lol literally all midfielders in the wrong places. McTominay as a Dm (he‚Äôs not good there but at least he can play there naturally) , Sabitzer as a 8 and Bruno at 10 should have been it",Manchester United,Yes,jeotve3,t1_jeosw85
"What do you want him to do in midfield.
Mctominay just does nothing in general, Sabitzer, Bruno and even Fred are all attacking minded midfielders. 

If anything Sabitzers, Mctoms and Weghosts when he drops back, off the ball movements are not good enough. None of them do anything that contributes to our defensive third ball progression.

I dont wanna just call out our midfielders. So in addition, our wingers today were not taking chances in the 1 on 1s. Opting to pass back too often and then we‚Äôd get pressed out and no midfield contribution to help ball progression.

Overall just a shit game but not the only one in our recent games.",Manchester United,Yes,jeov4f0,t1_jeosw85
Username checks out?,Manchester United,Yes,jesqya2,t1_jes1qgw
"Our strongest XI is improved, but our depth in key areas is shocking. I'd even say it's much worse than last season because Ole/Rangnick could somewhat utilize the likes of McTominay and Fred while they are incompatible with Ten Hag's philosophy. McTominay can't pass and Fred has no sense of positional discipline, two key aspects of Ten Hag's football.

We brought in Eriksen and Casemiro, yes, but Casemiro has missed quite a lot of games and Eriksen has been injured for pretty much two months now. Unsurprisingly, our plan started to fall apart when Eriksen got sidelined and it totally crumbled when Casemiro got suspension.

We are definitely heading in the right direction, but Fred and McTominay need to be replaced with players who can be proper backups to Casemiro and Eriksen, not just bodies who run around and harrass opponents. That was enough under Ole/Ralf but it's not enough now.",Manchester United,Yes,jep1r8n,t1_jep02e9
"It‚Äôs a good point about the signings, but it can be argued that nobody expected him and his signings to bed in perfectly in one season anyway. None of that ever guaranteed instant success. I don‚Äôt want to give him a complete year‚Äôs free pass but i think it has to be taken into account. 

Also regarding the points total, it was moreso from this point that we fell off a cliff last season right? Like we had a half decent spell under RR and then weee shambolic. At least that‚Äôs my deluded hope talking and thinking we‚Äôll end up way better off by May. Like we hovered around 5th-6th last season and we‚Äôre currently fourth, don‚Äôt really think we should expect to be 10+ points better off right now.",Manchester United,Yes,jep3ovb,t1_jep02e9
">but it seemed that our squad players like AWB, Fred, McTom had improved under him.

I feel like end of the day, no matter how much they improve the'll never be good enough. A massive clearout is needed. Hopefully with our new owners, this will be doable",Manchester United,Yes,jep4x7n,t1_jep02e9
"This was always going to be an inconsistent season. It's a little disappointing that so many people fully bought into the good parts and are now losing their head during the bad parts. There's fair things to be concerned about but there's still a lot of good to look forward to. 

>I back Ten Hag to the hilt, but isn‚Äôt it a bit disappointing that we only have difference of 3 points compared to last season, seeing as he got his first choice right winger, first choice CB(who is paired with Varane) and the best holding midfielder in the world?(paired with Eriksen who was also a shrewd signing)

I don't know, there were times last season that people genuinely believed top 4 was still on. There's 11 games left to go and the team finished with 58 points last season. That's just 8 points more than now. The strongest teams left in these 11 games are Spurs, Brentford and Brighton. 5 of the games are against teams close to getting relegated. The schedule is much easier now and at current points per game, they should finish 12 points ahead of last season. 

>Yes Eriksen has been out for a while and Casemiro as well(through no fault but his own) but it seemed that our squad players like AWB, Fred, McTom had improved under him.

And for a while they did look better, but mostly when they were allowed to do what they were good at while other players filled in the necessary roles around them. McTominay looked a lot better when Eriksen was tasked with the passing duties. That wasn't the case today, so it naturally looked worse. 

>This season has gone from being a revolution, winning trophies, comfortably securing 3rd place and playing good football to hopefully securing CL place and maybe win the EL in the span of a month.

They can't take the cup away mate. It's still a trophy winning season and the first small step back to the top. Top 4 might be difficult, but when Eriksen comes back from injury and Casemiro's suspension is over, things will get better again. Martial might even get fit and then it's just Donny left out injured. 

It's still a long way to reach City's level, but for top 4, teams like Spurs and Newcastle aren't consistent either. Newcastle can't score to save their life and who knows what Spurs will do now without Conte. It's still in United's hands and when the club gets a nice boost soon things will look more positive again.",Manchester United,Yes,jep98zo,t1_jep02e9
"Nah, I think that's a bad take after 1 loss. We ended last season in 6th place with 58 points. Our most difficult games in the PL this season are behind us now. We will finish much better than last season imo.",Manchester United,Yes,jepworm,t1_jep02e9
"sad fucks
plus the whole r/soccer talking about ten hag being the same manager as ole",Manchester United,Yes,jep18ot,t1_jeovtp1
For what,Manchester United,Yes,jeoqchf,t1_jeoq4sq
The contract situation is worrying me if we give Shaw/Dalot/Rash big increase in wages we are in the mud long term. Also De Gea situation is worrying if we sign him without wage decrease.,Manchester United,Yes,jero4s6,t1_jermtak
I had guessed he'd go to Chelsea the moment he was sacked from Bayern lmao.,Manchester United,Yes,jesx1ig,t1_jesojik
"\> The team that has been shit for a while, needs time to really get polished.

Except lot of people just want to hang on to the past or are totally clueless. So many people here are content keeping players like De Gea, McTominay, Weghorst etc. even though they're useless or give 300k per week contracts to players going through 4-5 months of great form after a year of being poor",Manchester United,Yes,jer0fzy,t1_jeqy8jj

Seems to be happening a lot",Manchester United,Yes,jepy69x,t1_jeowdeh

"You say excellent season but for the money we spent and the players signed for that money, we only have a surplus of 3 points compared to this stage last season. The games are coming thick and fast and we‚Äôve been on a downward trend since the Carabao Cup final with not a lot suggesting we can cope with the amount of games and actually finish top 4 and win the Europa League.

Tottenham are having a disaster season, have sacked their manager yet are only a point behind(albeit we have a game in hand) but this has been an excellent season for us apparently",Manchester United,Yes,jep0x3p,t1_jeowdeh
">and play them off the park with 60-70% possession.

This is fantasy, because matches between these types of teams are more like 50%/50% of possession than anything else.",Manchester United,Yes,jers2vq,t1_jer04tj
60-70% possession means dominating  the midfield and not playing Bruno.,Manchester United,Yes,jes9f7d,t1_jer04tj

"Antony should have never come off. He was literally our best attacking player. The problem with Rashford and this has been the case across all our managers has been that he can score in any given moment so even if he's having a 1/10 game you still have to keep him on. 

Personally I don't agree with that. But that's what we've constantly seen manger after manager do.",Manchester United,Yes,jep1ixr,t1_jeoslo2

"IF they sack him, I will be pissed. Best manger in a long time imho. Its clearly the players who are inconsistent.",Manchester United,Yes,jes4j7r,t1_jerwiiw
I like Ten Hag but lets not go over the top. His performance will be decided at the end of the season. If we start slipping then you can't just keep blaming the players.

"Literally a bunch of victims on this subreddit lol. Already read comments saying these players will get Ten Hag sacked off of one loss. Clowns.

If you can‚Äôt control the midfield then Bruno cant play centrally. It‚Äôs fine him giving the ball away when we are in control but on days like today he kills us. There‚Äôs a reason he gets stuck out wide in games like this usually. ETH should have put him out wide with Rashford down the middle and played Fred.

"De Gea's pass into Varane when he was getting pressed led to a throw in which was the start of sequence of their goal. He is half the reason we lose possession in our own half.

"Obviously De Gea is not great on the ball, but Licha taking goal kicks is not a sign of that. Nearly every time he takes one, he plays it to De Gea. Doesn't seem like the point is to avoid De Gea needing to play the ball if we give it to him anyways. I've seen it suggested that the idea is draw the opposition press in while giving him the option of playing the ball to either center back rather than him taking the goal kick to one side or the other which allows the press to cut the field in half.",Manchester United,Yes,jeq545m,t1_jep568q
"More than happy to move McTominay on, we can replace him with someone better there‚Äôs no doubt about that and I think you‚Äôll struggle to find even the biggest McT fan say otherwise. 

But I don‚Äôt understand the constant bashing of him like he‚Äôs the second coming of Bebe when we lose when more often than not it‚Äôs been the team as a whole being poor. 

I don‚Äôt even think he played that bad yesterday yet everyone‚Äôs acting like he scored 3 own goals. He was basically playing two positions yesterday, sprinting up and down the pitch like a dog which clearly hampered his ability to influence the game.",Manchester United,Yes,jeqix84,t1_jeqh6sc

"People love to talk about mentality but that's not really the issue here. Against Liverpool, it was the mentality. Against Man City earlier in the season, it was also mentality. Aside from that though, it's a lack of quality and more importantly a lack of suitable alternatives.

Eriksen and Casemiro are great, but they have no backups. Literally zero. We can play Fred, Sabitzer or McTominay instead of Eriksen but they don't play the same role. Eriksen progresses the ball and keeps possession, none of our other midfielders do that.

Then we have Casemiro who is good on the ball too, but his main role is winning the ball and protecting the defense. Again, we have nobody who can do that in our squad.

You look at Fred and he has some decent skills, but he lacks positional discipline so he is pretty much only useful as an attacking central midfielder, a role that is played by Bruno. So, Fred gets shoehorned into something he isn't.

McTominay is the same case. He is a mid-table box-to-box midfielder when he gets the freedom to join attack. He would probably be good for the likes of West Ham. Can we afford to play him in this role? No, so he gets shoehorned into the DM role where he is completely invisible.

As frustrating as it is, we are still in Ten Hag's first season. The squad is clearly heading in the right direction and our strongest XI is very good. However, our depth is either bad, not suited to our current football or a combination of both. We need to keep replacing players that don't have what it takes and Ten Hag needs to continue being supported.

We could also probably use one or two utility players who can give us 7/10 performances in multiple positions. Think of someone like Milner who usually does the job for Liverpool despite being played pretty much all across the pitch and despite being old.",Manchester United,Yes,jeqn9xa,t1_jeq5kxo

Firstly, most of the saves he makes are what you would expect any premier league level GK to make, yet when he makes them they are world class.

And yes while he does make saves, they do not on balance make up for the problems caused through his poor distribution and the fact he does not come off his line.

Eriksen gets injured and our midfield suddenly can't pass, Casemiro gets suspended and our midfield suddenly can't win the ball. That's not mentality, that's just Fred and McTominay not being anywhere close to being capable of being backups to Casemiro/Eriksen. They are bodies in the midfield who run around and harrass opponents and they can be okay in defensive counter-attacking.

People are really underrating the influence of having to play McTominay and Fred in Ten Hag's setup because they just don't have what it takes to fulfill the roles Ten Hag needs them to do.

The moment Eriksen and Casemiro come back, I fully expect us to suddenly play significantly better than we have been playing the past few weeks.

"It is an indirect indication of that. Lich√° drops back into the box, his CB partner goes to the side of our box and when Lich√° takes the goal kick, De Gea has two easy passes to his CBs available or if both get marked, he kicks it away.

I don't think other teams like Arsenal and City drop their CBs as deep as we do because they trust their keeper to find the mid-range passes between the lines. Ten Hag obviously doesn't think De Gea can do that, so he gives him easy short passing options instead but in order to do so, we drop deep as a team and we overall make the pitch smaller for ourselves instead of stretching it.",Manchester United,Yes,jeq691n,t1_jeq545m

Saint Maximim is a great player to watch, and he's really exciting for his directness and his flair. However, he's nowhere near as effective and productive as Rashford. 

Rashford has 27 goals this season, Saint Maximim has 35 in his **whole** career.

"Agreed. Then most of the argument is about his goals and assist returns. I don't care about individuals getting goals and assists particularly. A 5 yard pass to Eriksen who makes a 5 yard pass to Antony who sets up Rashford for a goal is worth exactly the same as a brilliant Bruno 50 yard pass as an assist

This sub will let you praise the brilliant passes Bruno makes but then refuses to recognise that a lot of his risky plays just end up in him giving possession away so we can't score the kind of passing goal I described as frequently as other top teams

He hasn't added goals to our team by any objective measure

20/21: 73 goals scored

21/22: 57 goals scored

22/23: On course for 57 goals scored

An average of 66.5 goals in the two seasons before Bruno. An average of 62.3 goals since Bruno.

So, maybe, the issue isn't the quality of our attackers but the fact that in order to contribute to goals, they are forced to pull off some individual magic. We don't control matches and we don't create enough chances sustainably. That's imo the main reason why players like Sancho and Antony seem shit, our attacking structure just doesn't work because we can't park ourselves around opposition box, pass the box around and create some opportunities via movement and passing plays.

When the criticism is consistently ""why is he playing the only midfielders that are available for the game in midfield"", it becomes a bit laughable, though.

If Bruno played there, he would likely do more about it, based on what we've seen Bruno do in other games. That's a fair criticism. That's based on a reality. I can point at the specific problem and point to a solution we saw work before. 

But for this game, people keep the criticism vague like saying ""poor subs"" when there really weren't any subs to make.

"> If a ""good on the ball"" or ""good sweeper keeper"" played instead of him today, it would've been more than 2

This idea that a keeper comfortable on the ball needs to be shit at saving shots (like Ederson) is dumb as fuck.

There is quite a lot of good modern keepers who are the complete package, just look at Diogo Costa. He makes De Gea-esque reflex saves every match without being a liability on the ball.

Anyway, I didn't really see De Gea do much wrong today in terms of passing, but what you need to keep in mind is that it's because Ten Hag has pretty much just gave up on the idea of De Gea being a legit passing option. Most top teams start the build-up from their keeper while we pretend our keeper doesn't exist in the build-up in order not to give the ball away in dangerous areas. You may not think that has a big impact but trust me, it does. Not using keeper in the build-up means that we are using one less man when we're trying to get the ball forwards which drags our attackers closer to our box to help progress the ball which in turn allows our opponents to press us even higher since they don't have to worry about our attackers that much. It's a sacrifice that Ten Hag made after the first two matches where De Gea was absolutely shit on the ball and we have been playing like that since, hurting our own build-up (that has been troublesome for us for years) in order to prevent De Gea from suicide-passing to attackers in our own box.

I mean, do you think it's good that Lisandro Martinez has taken **74 goal kicks this season** while the next highest number of goal kicks taken by an outfielder is 19 from Dunk, but with most defenders taking less than 10 goal kicks this season?

You're always allowed to criticize the manager, as long as you can substantiate the arguments. So whiny this.

Bruno is the only one who can progress the ball. He's always dropped deeper when he had to play with a midfield that can't do it themselves. That's why he dropped deeper yesterday too. 

>Bruno who is one of the best and most creative no10s in the world is playing in a position where he usually sucks to accommodate SCOTT MCTOMINAY. I'd understand if he was accommodating Lionel bloody Messi, but fuck me, it was a moronic tactical choice and the fact it took him until half time to finally start playing Scott deeper is a travesty.

Just look at the goal their first goal. The team struggled much more when it was McTominay at 6 to get the ball forward. Varane has no options to pass it forward and then loses it. 

Bruno isn't playing there to accommodate McTominay. It's because he can do a certain role that none of the other midfielders can. Playing Fred or Sabitzer or McTominay, it doesn't matter. 

>Weghorst is also a donkey. He should start Sancho or Pellistri and just use Rashford as a 9 if there's no other option.

Weghorst isn't good enough, but he's doing what he's asked to do. Sancho has shown nothing and you'd just get the same argument as you used on Bruno. Why would Rashford play up top to accommodate Sancho who hasn't shown much of anything at all? He's not Messi. 

Pellistri is a weird mention as well. This is so typical of the United fanbase. It's always the players that aren't playing that should be playing, and then when they do, people complain that the previous starters should have been playing instead. What the fuck has Pellistri done that makes you think he's worth accommodating for? 

>Why isn't Fred playing?! He had some good games and has just disappeared, he is never used from the start despite our CMs being missing. He's better than Scott that's for damn sure, even if Fred + Sabitzer is hardly great its still better than Bruno + Sabitzer with Scott as the fucking number 10.

"judging a signing purely on the price is a joke. Antony is not a finished product and the price paid was purely for his potential (which he has clearly shown already). Like how Madrid paid 60M for a 18 yo Vinicius who took 2-3 years to come good.

Weghorst is the complete opposite of this. Ten hag chose to get him on a loan to hit the ground running right away. Mans done fuck all for us till now. Just because we didnt pay a fee for him doesnt mean it wasnt a mistake.",Manchester United,Yes,jesalc5,t1_jes75kr

Comparing Antony to Vinicius is laughable. Antony is 23, not some kid. I don't think that it's clear he shown potential. It's clear that he's shown his limitations, with a smattering of moments.

I agree Weghorst has been trash - but he's a loan so we can bin him off at the end of the season. If we do end up signing him then yeah totally agreed he will compete with Antony for the biggest flop of ETH's era.",Manchester United,Yes,jescy90,t1_jesalc5

"Well it isnt the most important factor because price doesnt always correlate to skill. There are other factors that influence the price of a player. In Antony‚Äôs case its quite clear that Ajax didnt want to sell at the end of the window.

I feel sorry for all our previous managers, honestly. I know all of them had their faults but this fucking ownership has hamstrung every single one of them.

Now people are getting dissapointed with Weghorst, which I think is utterly unfair. He is the only player in that front three that really puts pressure on that defence. The only way to keep pressure off that midfield. Thats the reason ten Hag has to choose him. If you look at the Martial and Sancho substitution.

"Anytime this team hits a slump, we return to the same talking points:  
  
No Casemiro, No Eriksen, Weghorst isn't good enough etc etc.  
  
Weghorst had a noticeable dip in performance vs Newcastle, but that was because he played 90 for the Netherlands in their 2 games, and then started with us. He has been playing a lot of minutes and it was bound to catch up to him. Martial's come back is good to give him a breather.  
  
But its not because of Weghorst that we lost. We lost because our midfield was porous. McTominay was playing as an 8, higher up. Bruno was all over the place. Sabitzer has no presence.  
  
Our defense was thus bombarded and our attackers couldn't generate anything. Add to that Rashford was playing like he was carrying an injury, and was ineffective. Antony was our only bright spark, but its not enough. Bruno also played like 88 minutes in the two euro qualifiers for Portugal. These players are simply fatigued, not fresh etc. Even Martinez was not fresh.  
  
ETH got it wrong with our midfield. Sabitzer should be playing in Bruno's role especially when he is out fatigued, Fred and McTominay should have been sitting, with Fred doing the shuttling. Rashford should not have started. Sancho should have started the game.  
  
ETH should use his squad better. Maguire played 90 in the two Euro qualifiers, but has had less minutes overall. He should have been paired with Varane, especially because Newcastle have tall players. When you make certain players undroppable (Rashford, Bruno) you end up with scores like this. I have always maintained that it is better to play fresh, hungry players than fatigued talented players.  
  
Also we don't need Casemiro to beat this newcastle team. Fred, Mctominay and Sabitzer would have been more than enough. Also we lost heavily with Eriksen to Brighton and Brentford. He is not the solution.",Manchester United,No,jesuuw3,t3_128vc3k

Rashford was clearly not match ready as he exposed Trippiers side giving free punts into our box consistently. You know Newcastles main source of creativity is on that side and both goals came from a cross on the right. This is just textbook laziness. Play Bruno as a false right so the midfield can be overloaded, At least then De Geas awful distribution could‚Äôve been avoided. 

I didn‚Äôt like the fact that Mctominay kept blazing forward for no reason exposing a massive gap in the middle, either have both pivots sit deep with Bruno coming in to collect earlier or play a high line so the back line isn‚Äôt exposed. 

We have a serious problem with our positioning in the middle of the park. It‚Äôs a half hearted high pressing line with a deep defensive line exposing the midfield. We don‚Äôt have 2 Kantes in the middle to cover that much distance.",Manchester United,No,jesxncg,t3_128vc3k
I‚Äôm glad that Eriksen is getting recognised more for what he contributed to us in buildup despite his physical weaknesses. Casemiro is the obvious loss but our performances haven‚Äôt always looked convincing even with him in the team because of the lack of composure on the ball when Eriksen doesn‚Äôt play. We need two players of a similar mould now and at least one needs to be a definite upgrade on Eriksen.,Manchester United,No,jet27ku,t3_128vc3k

"Never forget that when Roberto Carlos complained about racist chants from Barcelona fans, Pep (their captain) came out and said Carlos ""talks too much"" and insinuated that Carlos was disrespecting them and didn't know them well enough to complain about racism. That's before he had problems with Yaya Toure, Eto'o, and others in his career.

Oh, also don't forget he was caught doping in 2001, failed multiple drug tests and was banned as a player. He sends all of his players to the same doctor that provided him with those drugs (Ramon Cugat) and calls him ""the best doctor in the world"" despite the fact that he was not renowned or even really well-known until he blew up because of the doping scandal. Curious.

That's without going into any of the UEFAlona shit and his obvious looking the other was to City's financial doping (even claiming ignorance). All that despite the fact that City's CEO Ferran Soriano and Director of Football Txiki Begiristain are close personal friends of his, both of whom he worked with during his time managing Barcelona (and he played at Barcelona with Begiristain in the 90s as well).

There's plenty more, but yeah, I think ""classless prick"" just about scratches the surface",Manchester United,Yes,jekzqv3,t1_jekms2f

How can you scout Alvarez and not see that he can do the job in which at around the time there were talks that Ten Hag was already the favorite to be the next manager. The gulf between the two clubs' recruitment strategy /planning and the squad building ability cannot be more apparent.

Zebs really wants a GK who can pass aggressively through the middle to players under pressure, allowing one twos and rapid ball play to create counters or overloads.    
Sanchez missed a few of them and instead looked for safer options which broke the structure down.    His defensive passing wider meant they weren't breaking the press properly and put Brighton under more pressure.

Henderson (¬£20m+), Williams (¬£10m+), Maguire (¬£25m+), McT (¬£30m+), Telles (¬£5m) and Bailly (¬£5m) will all likely leave.

Obviously the players will need to agree to leave and take the pay cut, but at this stage of their careers they will want out and if they go that‚Äôs circa ¬£100m in revenue.

Then there‚Äôs VdB and one of the right backs who could go.

So while we can‚Äôt have a Chelsea transfer window (unless we do the long contracts insanity if that‚Äôs even an option), I do think we could have a similar spend to last summer if not more.

Sell him to Burnley so they can play weghorst 9 and McT 10 next season,Manchester United,Yes,jeor9tx,t1_jeon84t
"Very grudgingly. But yeah they‚Äôre a great side. Passing under pressure, linkup, movement of the attackers, pressing, it‚Äôs all on point. I really hope they continue to be this good next season because I want us to raise our game and shit all over them.",Manchester United,Yes,jena9y4,t1_jemo9kr
"They have the youngest team, they can do it! I want them to win this year (since we haven't been in the race since 1st week, unfortunately) but city are so dominant ugh. Let's hope they don't bottle it.",Manchester United,Yes,jemqg71,t1_jemo9kr
"Great read,thanks for sharing. We really need a good,competent and top class recruitment structure under new ownership.",Manchester United,Yes,jerbbab,t1_jeqhs0b
"He shouldn't be anywhere near a top 6 team's squad.

Scotty is almost 27 years old and they're giving him chances like he is 21.",Manchester United,Yes,jerogce,t1_jern5sa
"Crazy how Iqbal can't get gametime when he's technically more superior than some of the ""senior"" midfielder. Lad can receive the ball, initiate the first phase of play

Phenomenal talent",Manchester United,Yes,jera28q,t1_jer8t5u
What happened to Bergwijn? Always thought he was a decent player. Maybe not too 6 level but at least solid PL player. Can‚Äôt cut it at Ajax now?,Manchester United,Yes,jennb7b,t1_jenhdc8
How did we get rinsed twice?,Manchester United,Yes,jenoeee,t1_jenhdc8
Eh. Licha was a bargain tbh,Manchester United,Yes,jenq2u7,t1_jenhdc8

"This overconfidence is hilarious considering a lot of us were saying we could and would best Liverpool since they are rubbish. 

Chelsea are going to sack Potter before we play them anyway.",Manchester United,Yes,jekqih1,t1_jekmwjm
Only Manchester United comes up so could you tell why?,Manchester United,Yes,jepcod4,t1_jepc46i
"You forget why we went for Weghorst in the first place, lack of transfer funds.",Manchester United,Yes,jen8bxg,t1_jen50lt
"Mudryk looked good early on and he would have done better going into a settled team like Arsenal. Now his confidence is shot.

Why he would give up a chance at the league title to play for mid table position just to get a few extra bucks is beyond me though.",Manchester United,Yes,jen5w7l,t1_jen50lt
Mudryk looks rubbish but hey he's got 8 years to show his worth üòÑ,Manchester United,Yes,jen5u2k,t1_jen50lt
"I'm an Arsenal fan who likes to read other club's subreddits... I think for a lot of the younger fans, this is the first time they have ever seen Arsenal playing really good football, and having a (close to) world class players in the team, so I think they get a bit carried away. I agree that it's annoying when people bumble into a discussion to make it about their own club or players. I also think it highlights a person who doesn't watch much football beyond their own team's matches.",Manchester United,Yes,jert28b,t1_jephtu2
"How about win both cups and finish 4th, like a real team?",Manchester United,Yes,jeqxtqm,t1_jeqolgk

"Fit, not fit",Manchester United,Yes,jekuond,t1_jekudzd
I think Donny has probably played his last game for the club. I can see him sold or on loan with a cheap sale clause next season,Manchester United,Yes,jekwb1o,t1_jekudzd

"Rather have Napoli or Real win it, who the fuck cares about how tuchel feels in this sub",Manchester United,Yes,jenghl1,t1_jenfrnv
"Lol none of them have been worth the fees paid save for Martinez, Varane and Case. Beaten by a team with heart assembled at a fraction of the cost, the team might as well call themselves Mercenary United",Manchester United,Yes,jeomcka,t1_jeol7k1
"No. The same applies if City win UCL. 

If Chelsea do however (& don't make top 4), then England would have 5 participants in UCL.",Manchester United,Yes,jen86fv,t1_jen5g5c
"If we finish in the top 4 then all the top 4 sides get CL regardless of cup wins.

The only way 4th misses a CL spot is if we drop out of the top 4 but win the EL and Chelsea win the CL.",Manchester United,Yes,jencui5,t1_jen5g5c
No,Manchester United,Yes,jen5tse,t1_jen5g5c
I think it does as long as we finish top 4 as well,Manchester United,Yes,jen67z0,t1_jen5g5c

"""you already use Google search & Google maps, so why not use a Google phone?"" - that part always irritates the hell out of me",Manchester United,Yes,jeo2ayk,t1_jent64k
A lot will change with Eriksen and Casemiro back. We played our best football this season with them both on the pitch.,Manchester United,Yes,jerwq1c,t1_jertpve
"Serious doubt? That is some big time negativity man. The lads can do It, but not without the support of the fans",Manchester United,Yes,jespc4t,t1_jertpve
"‚ÄúBenjamin Pavard‚Äù shouts ffs. Recruiting should be  Ten Hag and the DoF discussing targets and the recruitment team finding close alternatives. Right now I think it‚Äôs just Ten Hag and whoever he likes get signed lol

edit: article mentions dumfries as well. If Inter fans lost patience with him then why are we in for him. Also plays in a back 5 and essential just a winger",Manchester United,Yes,jesjk6v,t1_jesivig
Pretty sure Weghorst didn't start vs. France,Manchester United,Yes,jeswg8j,t1_jesuuw3
He‚Äôs too good at cb to move him,Manchester United,Yes,jepb2ly,t1_jep7yi2
The guy didn't speak to Ten Hag before he left for Forest & he spoke of avoiding training before he left so that he wouldn't have to stay. He also refused to come back in Jan. I'd say his bridges are all but burned here.,Manchester United,Yes,jen7wn4,t1_jen5zwt
"Lingards earns 120k, so a close second",Manchester United,Yes,jen8tlm,t1_jen5zwt
I don't get the Henderson hatred anyway. We benched him for a whole season after promising him the no.1 spot. Of course he didn't appreciate that. It's weird how people demand unconditional loyalty from players as if they're not human beings.,Manchester United,Yes,jen7kmd,t1_jen5zwt
"Ten Hag just wants to win so I doubt he'd hold a grudge. If Henderson's good enough and wants to work hard to become number 1 he'll let him stay, whether he is or isn't is a different matter.

I doubt that he'll get promised the number 1 spot and he's proven that he doesn't want to take that risk anymore in this stage of his career so I don't see him wanting to stay.",Manchester United,Yes,jenhyav,t1_jen5zwt
"Exactly! Imagine what we could have done if they back ETH properly in the Winter windows instead of Weg and Sabitzer.

Fuck the Glazers!",Manchester United,Yes,jerv1hd,t1_jerhjb0
doubt its the ownership. they have spent the most amount of money possible in the PL in the last decade. The truth is that we have no one to blame and thats why just point fingers to the glazers. Just need to stick with the team and haag for a couple of seasons and hope he is atleast 10-20% the likes of Pep/arteta,Manchester United,Yes,jeokoqu,t1_jeoijwm
"Sancho only works when we are comfortably winning or playing against a lower level team. 

When the chips are down he won't fight for it.",Manchester United,Yes,jeqowqn,t1_jeq6gn4
"I‚Äôm not convinced we should sign Kane either but not because he won‚Äôt make a mark. Kane is as much of a sure thing as you can get in the Premier League. 

The worry is for how long and if he‚Äôs worth spending more than half our budget on him when the squad is so weak.",Manchester United,Yes,jes5cqd,t1_jes50y0
Why did we sign Casemiro even though he was 30? Kane is a world class striker who is part of a Spurs team who have been infamous for underperforming for decades,Manchester United,Yes,jes668z,t1_jes50y0
Under poch the squad was not built around him. It only happened under Mourinho and conte because everyone else stopped scoring,Manchester United,Yes,jes6bju,t1_jes50y0
"Harry Kane might not have the impact like Zlatan, but he is the main man in the English national team. If anything, I do hope this move would hopefully remove him of the jinx caused by pressures in a trophy finale. If we do, we are doing Kane and the nation a massive favour.",Manchester United,Yes,jes9akl,t1_jes50y0
"We'll get Casemiro back after two games, I think we'll make it, we have to play Spurs so there is a chance to grab points from them. We definitely need a back-up DM like Lavia if S'ampton go down or Amrabat who is on his final year of his contact or someone third.",Manchester United,Yes,jepc2hy,t1_jep7le9
Bro really said we need 20 new players lol,Manchester United,Yes,jerfklg,t1_jerfab4
"The question should be why is Bruno receiving from the RB position. He has to drop back because without Casemiro and Eriksen are players can‚Äôt get him the ball higher up. Season in season he puts up incredible numbers of chances created, if we replaced all our players with ball retainers we will then be complaining of too many sideways passing.

We need a player who can sit in misfield and make 75-100 passes a game, but we also need someone like Bruno to create.",Manchester United,Yes,jergi5h,t1_jerfab4
Drama,Manchester United,Yes,jeplplw,t1_jep3vo1
Dunno about that one big guy - I remember us being quite heavily under the cosh in the last 15-20 mins or so. Think there definitely are better examples of exhilarating matches that we've been part of this season.,Manchester United,Yes,jenb3y3,t1_jenasj5
LOL. Arsenal were all over us for the last 30 minutes or so. It was very one-sided. When I realized we are far from Arsenal and ETH needs more time before we label this team as a genuine title challenger.,Manchester United,Yes,jendncu,t1_jenasj5
"Nah I'm with you. Football is about entertainment at the end of the day and successes aren't really ours. That was just a proper game of football, shame we lost it but that's how it goes sometimes. Too many people lose sight of that.",Manchester United,Yes,jenco2k,t1_jenasj5
Don‚Äôt think so. I don‚Äôt think we are getting another defensively suspect RB,Manchester United,Yes,jesz3bd,t1_jesxtwu
Frimpong didn't do much during his Arsenal days didn't he?,Manchester United,Yes,jet12xh,t1_jesxtwu
Because Ederson is actually good at distribution usually you dumbo and doesn't play for us,Manchester United,Yes,jeo23fz,t1_jenz93j
"Ederson is one of the only keepers in the league below De Gea in terms of [goals prevented](https://www.fotmob.com/leagues/47/stats/season/17664/players/_goals_prevented/premier-league-players)

They are both terrible shot stoppers relative to their premier league peers

Ederson just has (much) more to the other aspects of his game than De Gea",Manchester United,Yes,jeo0its,t1_jenz93j
nah,Manchester United,Yes,jes0dyu,t1_jes084b
"Eh,  I feel people here overrate our youth players too much.

Simply doing the bare minimum gets praised to high heaven.

Hannibal got so much praise here last season when I don't remember him doing anything other than being erratic and hotheaded on the pitch. 

Elanga is too far along to go to a loan a tier lower than the top level.

Clubs like Dortmund and PSV wanted him in the winter.

Everton wanted him too when fat Frank was there.

No chance he's going down to the championship for a loan.",Manchester United,Yes,jem3wx4,t1_jelyd8z
"It‚Äôs because Elanga has almost 50 senior appearances for us, plays as a winger and is older than McNeill. Also, being a young winger is a lot more forgiving than being a young Striker.",Manchester United,Yes,jelzsoz,t1_jelyd8z
"Well, let's be real here. People wanted Savage and Iqbal to feature in our first team because they were midfielders who could actually keep the ball and pass forwards. McTominay-Fred is a diabolical partnership when it comes to playing on the ball so I would say it's fair to say a bunch of our youngsters looked better in possession than they do.

However, at the time McTominay and Fred were our only midfielders. The moment we signed Casemiro and started playing Eriksen alongside him, we no longer really needed to utilize our raw youngsters.",Manchester United,Yes,jenjy1h,t1_jelyd8z
"Here come the player lists, the subreddit version of Fuck, Marry, Kill üò±üò±üò±",Manchester United,Yes,jeovkr7,t1_jeov079
"How?

[Ragnick](https://www.premierleague.com/managers/48399/Ralf-Rangnick/overview) had 24 games, 10 wins 7 draws for 37 points??

ETH is on 50 points from 27 games...",Manchester United,Yes,jepbbcq,t1_jep825v
"Stop peddling this bullishit stat, we finished last season with 58 points and we‚Äôre currently on 50 points with 12 games remaining. We‚Äôve also played all of the big teams already.",Manchester United,Yes,jepb0vy,t1_jep825v
"Jesus fuck, there's always someone with a bullshit stat",Manchester United,Yes,jeplkws,t1_jep825v
But we are in two more competitions.,Manchester United,Yes,jepb7dc,t1_jep825v
we are basically back to mcfred midfield. There is no need to figure us out.,Manchester United,Yes,jep6gvk,t1_jep1yw3
I think after the Everton league game.,Manchester United,Yes,jerkcxj,t1_jerjkrk
seriously? the team is still in top 4 and competing for another two trophies and you gave up on them.. Talking about fragile mentality.....,Manchester United,Yes,jepjc60,t1_jephuqm
"No? They'll get it, but they deserve relegation",Manchester United,Yes,jeomrel,t1_jeomfhx
AWB is ill.,Manchester United,Yes,jenzi7f,t1_jenuuku
Against Brentford and Everton. Not expecting more than 4 points after today's game.,Manchester United,Yes,jepbfao,t1_jep7p0q
"We've had a crazy fixture schedule, unrealistic to expect players to be that intense all season long. Still doesn't excuse how ""lazy"" and sloppy the playerslooked yesterday!",Manchester United,Yes,jesycvg,t1_jesil7b
"At least they show up for the ball, unlike McTominay",Manchester United,Yes,jesjns7,t1_jesiq0c
We capitulated badly that 2nd half. Losing at Anfield isn‚Äôt a disgrace but how we gave up was just awful. Liverpool had like 8 or 9 shots in total (IIRC) they didn‚Äôt even need to be amazing to do that,Manchester United,Yes,jekvuwl,t1_jekpaij
"30 points at home vs 12 away, I think I read.",Manchester United,Yes,jekuefs,t1_jekpaij
the lord works in mysterious ways,Manchester United,Yes,jelc2zt,t1_jekuldi
"He might just turn it around because  he did well with Brighton but it will take way too long like he did at Brighton or Arteta took at Arsenal. Chelsea fans might not like it, but with sunk costs into consideration, they might continue till end of the season to see how he does in UCL, and suppose they make semi or something it might work  in his favour",Manchester United,Yes,jel0ezh,t1_jekph0m
"He did well with Bayern he didn‚Äôt get a good chance, he was still in the champions league he could have won it",Manchester United,Yes,jekquhn,t1_jeknr2m
Honestly Rooney would be the perfect player in any system.,Manchester United,Yes,jemgotk,t1_jemg4zg

"If they get Nagelsman, they will become a threat",Manchester United,Yes,jenjry8,t1_jenb9ml
"Preach it.

I'm not even surprised about the referees being bought. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I smelt a rat with the UEFALona Chelsea CL semi in 2009. Knew there had to be something dodgy going on.

Honestly, I wanted to punch the smug prick in the face after seeing him dance around with glee at full time. Did not deserve to be in the final.

I absolutely fucking hate the way all of these fans, pundits and journalists line up to blow him and act as if he's the ""bestest manager of all  time ever"". Guy is a cheat and a fraud, and will never be fit to lace the boots of the likes of SAF as he'll never take a challenging managerial job in his life.

Hope all of his ""achievements"" at both Barca and City are binned, as they damn well should be and he fucks off with his tail between his legs.",Manchester United,Yes,jel0ei6,t1_jekzqv3
He'll never do it because every situation has to be crafted perfectly just for him. If he was in SAF's position at Aberdeen he'd be crying that he needs 500 million and Messi.,Manchester United,Yes,jel8jr1,t1_jel7ira
"I dislike Klopp for obvious reasons, but that being said, there is something instinctively likable about him, so I can't bring myself to dislike him completely. Guardiola however is just a slimy little bastard. He strikes me as the sort of person who would cheat to win and then brag about it relentlessly as if he's done something legitimate. It's like he enjoys mocking people. No surprises with all these allegations coming out against 2 of the 3 clubs he's managed.",Manchester United,Yes,jel0u9o,t1_jel0a4a
"He reminds me of those couples that always act lovey-dovey in public , but then when they get home they scrub each other with cheese graters.",Manchester United,Yes,jelyue6,t1_jel0a4a
Atleast they play attacking football. Much prefer Buli and Serie A to La Liga,Manchester United,Yes,jemi487,t1_jelchgy
Doesn't help when refs are a little biased towards the spanish teams in the UEFA competitions.,Manchester United,Yes,jell5qj,t1_jel159c
We could be building a second Ferguson stand in 20 years ;),Manchester United,Yes,jen2mls,t1_jen2hrj
"Yeah, I could speculate on what Brighton‚Äôs asking price would be but it would be a total guess.",Manchester United,Yes,jen2ea2,t1_jen1frn
I had replied to this with a guess but I‚Äôve no clue to be honest. It would be a total guess.,Manchester United,Yes,jen2g5o,t1_jen0ibm
"In this market with 4 yrs left on his contract? 
They ll quote something crazy like 75m
It's Brighton",Manchester United,Yes,jene5q8,t1_jen0ibm
"he's so technically good people overlook his excellent physicality, he runs so powerfully",Manchester United,Yes,jem5frk,t1_jelwcd4
Can't believe you're getting downvoted for talking sense. McTominay stans are insane. They want him to keep starting and sabotage the team,Manchester United,Yes,jer2vco,t1_jeqmy5j
"Oh they definitely did all that. No question about it. However, we all know PL won't give them a punishment severe enough to deter that so if we want to challenge for the title, we just have to compete against these cheats",Manchester United,Yes,jenwcu7,t1_jens27a
Almost as if Rangnick was right. Wasted a full season potentially because no-one listened to him.,Manchester United,Yes,jeqpc6t,t1_jeq43id
"just don't have the money or FFP room for that

we need to be smarter in the transfer window:  look at players who are running down their contracts; stop paying club's ""fuck-off"" prices",Manchester United,Yes,jergftc,t1_jeq43id
Well yeah if the replacement is Tom Heaton. Not if the replacement is one of the numerous goalkeepers that are as good or better than him,Manchester United,Yes,jerwnw5,t1_jervz43
"Could‚Äôve been an option for Real if they failed on Bellingham, now he‚Äôs a prisoner at Chelsea for the next 9 years",Manchester United,Yes,jen1mp4,t1_jemy9gh
Mudryk looks like he has zero confidence,Manchester United,Yes,jelzvvj,t1_jelia5g
"Oh come on he‚Äôs suffering enough, can‚Äôt sentence him to spurs",Manchester United,Yes,jelii7b,t1_jelc09h
"If Potter gets fired, his rep is burned for a long time",Manchester United,Yes,jem5yfw,t1_jelc09h
I just think Bundesliga is a class below the prem. So many people coming over here from there don‚Äôt quite measure up.,Manchester United,Yes,jepg7oi,t1_jepcrjd
"I thought that, but there‚Äôs no‚Ä¶ actual digital ticket. There‚Äôs a section that says my name, seat number etc. but no actual ticket, like QR code or anything.

It also has a little picture of a printer with a cross through it which just seems odd to me.",Manchester United,Yes,jemqcwg,t1_jemq4xi
"It's not spoken about much compared to Arteta's struggles, or even Ole during the lows. 

Easy to guess why. Same reason Lampard got a free pass for having a team about to win the CL look utterly hopeless.",Manchester United,Yes,jelw192,t1_jelnkhc
"Its the first season. Lets wait and see how he plays next year, then we can come with a verdict. Its common knowledge players need a season to adjust to PL",Manchester United,Yes,jen6ih3,t1_jemp33e
Obviously...,Manchester United,Yes,jens01l,t1_jenr0np
"Teams that have had their manager longer than we've had Erik (Aka they had them at least for the final day for the previous season): Arsenal, City, Newcastle, Brentford, Liverpool, Fulham, West Ham, Nottingham

All the rest have fired their manager at least once at some point this season

I atleast assume thats the way they mean it",Manchester United,Yes,jensocb,t1_jenr0np
"I‚Äôll say 76

That‚Äôs 2 points out of every 3 available over the course of the season

26 more points in 12 games is 8 wins, 2 draws and 2 losses. 

Looking at the rest of our fixtures, two wins out of every 3 games is not improbable",Manchester United,Yes,jely07i,t1_jelvj75
Would be kinda funny actually,Manchester United,Yes,jesxyzs,t1_jessyt7
"Yea Arsenal v United games used to be quite heated battles (think Schmiechel Vs Wright) and with their previous manager they started attracting some half decent talent (I think Berkamp and Overmars joined before Wenger?).
Wenger had a half decent foundation to build an attack on United from.",Manchester United,Yes,jen9ktu,t1_jekrhtn
"lol mate there's celebrating and then there's stuff like this: [https://twitter.com/NUFC/status/1642589340361535499](https://twitter.com/NUFC/status/1642589340361535499)

"Yea he said his job was to be annoying to Barca. I think that would have been useful today, at least more useful than he was as striker.",Manchester United,Yes,jepjgtz,t1_jepd3ci
"I was hoping ETH would do something like play Lindelof or Martinez sitting in front of the back 4 and clog up the middle, maybe even play 5 at the back to compensate for the lack of midfield options. Sabitzer as a lone pivot, Bruno as box to box and McTominay as a 10 was just weird and didn‚Äôt work, especially on the left because Rashford didn‚Äôt track back. So Bruno had to go to the left to cover for Rashford, McTominay was jogging around upfield and Sabitzer was alone against 2 sometimes 3 Newcastle midfielders.",Manchester United,Yes,jesyjg0,t1_jesxxeh
this has nothing to do with the performance,Manchester United,Yes,jepl65z,t1_jepktu3
Yes there are. I've seen plenty of comments over the past several months about how he's good squad player on low wages so we should keep him. I've also seen comparisons to Fletcher lmao. You can pretend those people don't exist all you want but I won't,Manchester United,Yes,jer7r0r,t1_jer7fi1
"Of course the problem lies above them. But previous managers were replaced by someone who had us looking better than the previous manager so the latter was given way more flak for the damage they caused. Ole was actually replaced by a manager who did pretty much as bad as him so he had a buffer between himself and ETH. When we were playing well under ETH, people immediately piled on Ralf for making them look like shit all while forgetting that they looked like shit under Ole too",Manchester United,Yes,jescd1i,t1_jerh75p
"You dont get that, true, hence why some players needs a season to adjust to PL. Its actually rather common. People keep writing players off after one season, please.",Manchester United,Yes,jen6d0o,t1_jen17r3
"Saliba and Martinelli are the only ones bought for Emery that still start. Though Emery did give Saka his chance to debut too, so that kind of counts. Then the only other one is Xhaka, who was signed by Wenger. All other regular starters are Arteta signings.",Manchester United,Yes,jerrrn4,t1_jerhrl6
"White would start. Trippier has been the only better RB in the league this year. 

Zinchencko/Shaw is 50/50 both have been good but inconsistent. But Zinchencko would easily slot into United's midfield. Him playing next to Casemiro would be a great combo.",Manchester United,Yes,jes5y8r,t1_jersdxd

">Obviously the players will need to agree to leave and take the pay cut,

could see most will leave on a loan again to get them off the ffp. maybe magurire/mct/elanga will have some offers but don't think we can bring in 80-100m from sales. not our style.",Manchester United,Yes,jenj92k,t1_jen53px
"True. But I dont see us getting anything even that for the likes of Williams, Telles, Bailly. Maybe if our new owners bring in a competent DoF & transfer negotiators. 60-70M is the max I see us getting & should suffice for a good midfielder next to Casemiro, if our scouts do their job for once.",Manchester United,Yes,jenyi0c,t1_jen53px
"Jones for 50mil because Sir Alex once he said he is one of the best players to ever play for the club, Elanga for 100mil because he is a speedy goalscorer so he will replace Mbapp√© who will come to us for 10mil because he failed to win the World Cup. Oh and we'll also do a straight swap of Charlie Savage for Vitinha because Savage has a father who came from our academy so that's pretty valuable while Vitinha is the perfect profile of a player that we need.

And then of course we'll sell Maguire for 100mil to Braga. Definitely nothing fishy going on over here.",Manchester United,Yes,jenj9b1,t1_jen12yy
"This is sick a good take, everything you said is on point",Manchester United,Yes,jent46z,t1_jens9l0
"I was thinking of him also, he always seems to do well with what‚Äôs being provided to him",Manchester United,Yes,jenu711,t1_jensh94

"To be fair I'm not sure I actually want them to win the league, id probably rather city win it as they aren't a real club

But I do think we could be seeing the beginnings of another power shift in English football, one which we are hopefully part & parcel of

I can see the Klopp/Guardiola's dominance coming to it's end - and a new era where its us & Arsenal dominating domestically for 5+ years

When I look at city now I just see much more of a mess than had ever been there before

"From his point of view it makes sense though. Criticize him all you want but he was THE best upcoming English keeper. He was among the best keepers in each league he played in during his loans and he was also one of the best keepers in the Prem at Sheffield United when they were chasing top6 straight after promotion. At that time, he was significantly better than De Gea because De Gea had a terrible season and was letting in howler after howler.

Then we recalled Dean and proceeded to have him sit on the bench for two seasons in a row. The one time he actually got the starting spot was when De Gea left for Spain and while you could see Deano isn't as good of a shot-stopper, our defense seemed much more confident with him being more proactive and we kept a few clean sheets in a row, something we were pretty much unable to do with De Gea for the whole season.

At that point, Deano proved he offers a lot to the team. Ole reportedly promised him he would be his number 1 so he declined good loan moves that would have helped him develop. Then he got covid, sure, pretty unlucky, but if he was supposed to be the number 1 then he should have got a chance again, no? Well, not at Manchester United where sentimentality wins over everything. Since that moment until the end of the season, Deano pretty much didn't play at all. Even when De Gea had a few poor games in a row and didn't fit what Rangnick needed, Deano was always on the bench.

I feel like fans are crazy to criticize Henderson for the way he behaved. Look at how Chelsea treated Courtois - he was sent on a few loans, was doing great and then he threatened to leave unless he gets a chance at Chelsea so they brought him back, had him alongside ƒåech and after one season ƒåech got benched and sold to Arsenal because Courtois was the future for them. That's something we should have done with De Gea and Henderson. At 22, Henderson had the potential to be better than the likes of Pope and Pickford. After we wasted two years of his career by having him sit on the bench and not even playing on loan somewhere, the potential is no longer there imo. It's understandable he wanted to go play no matter what.

Literally played 2 games. One of them was basically a training game when even Heaton was given some minutes lmao. I'm not going to bother debating with you whether 168 minutes is enough of a ""chance"" for any player let alone a GK because I already know your response. 

>He was blocked from leaving on loan because he was our second keeper.

Sure. That's from a club standpoint. From his standpoint of course he'd be upset at it since he knew he wasn't going to play and still had to stay.

Like I said, it's understandable from a player standpoint why he wouldn't want to risk wasting yet another full year of his career. I couldn't possibly care less about fans getting upset about this, that's just what they do. Good on Dean for not giving a shit about that and looking out for himself because the fans that demand so much loyalty themselves have none. I will always laugh at people who get upset at these things. 

Btw, both Forest and Spurs are interested in signing him so you're wrong again. Navas came when he was injured, just like De Gea came in when he had COVID.

Like it or not, but what the future holds for North London for the next 5 years is our rivals from across the road challenging/winning PL titles and us fighting for a place in Europa. 

And that is on Levy. We had 2 WC attackers in their primes for a long time but we completely fucked it. Kane and Son will leave this club without a single trophy, because instead of building a team around them, Levy just allowed them to carry us to top 4 every other year.

I've just had a latte. Treated the wife and the kid to a Maccys brekkie this morning. Shes off out today but I've decided to go on holiday, its going to be chaotic next week.

Anyway enough about me, lets talk spurs;

The Everton result, I expected to actually lose. Since Dyche came in that team has organised itself a lot better. I think he's going to be at Everton for a while. Good for them.

Regarding our manager situation; I wasn't getting overly excited about Nagelsmann. It looked like as soon as Chelsea was being announced, it was ""here we go again"" again. I don't get overly excited now about rumours. Sure, its cool we're linked to amazing managers and players. But I'll be honest, where we are now. It's going to be rough for the next couple of seasons. We do need a rebuild and I'll be honest, Arteta is doing it right. He got rid of a lot of disruptive influences now look where they are.

The way we played against Everton has been the same over and over again. We have 10 minutes of good football. Then we don't bother.

As Porro said; we now have nine finals to play. Our first one is against Brighton but all we can do as fans is support the team week in week out. I'm not into the ""starve the board of money by not buying season tickets or merchandise"". I watch the team. I support spurs in and out.

They spent a fuckton on players without any direction, they just burned cash on back to back managers that most clubs would kill to have and they are appointing an incompetent moron as they sit just above the relegation battle.

Do we have problems? Definitely. But Chelsea are ONLY not a complete laughing stock because they have so much fucking money they can literally set it on fire with mistake after mistake. We are not them and we are not shit. We have problems, but it's not THAT bad.",Spurs,No,jf30gde,t3_12c91np

"How much do Analysts factor into managerial decision making about football? Like do Spurs have a backroom staff of football analysts feeding information to our Paratici (RIP) and Levy? 

I ask because those TIFO guys are huge football nerds who do a great job of breaking down the tactical side of football. They called Conte's tactics failing in the second season like 14 months ago. They called Graham Potter's Chelsea not going to be able to score based on what they knew of him at Brighton. 

I ask all this because they have highlighted what good teams are doing in the current ""meta"" of football. Positional tactics, box midfields, counter pressing, etc...

If a bunch of youtube nerds can see things that clearly, we must be paying some backroom staff for similar insights right?",Spurs,No,jf1j37l,t3_12c91np

Our only good current alternatives might be Arne Slot, Kompany and Postecoglu and honestly I only prefer Slot over Pochettino but even Slot isn't a guarantee to be willing to abandon Feyenoord for us. We should be doing everything we can to convince Pochettino to join us right now. If Donna Cullen is the main obstacle in the way. we gotta sack her.

"Does anyone else feel like they can't really be Levy and/or Enic out without a viable alternative option on the table? To just demand a change without presenting the alternative is tantamount to suggesting literally _anyone_ would be better as chairman and for all the errors Levy's made recently and historically, I feel like even the most ardent critic can't possibly believe that. Without wanting to draw lines across cultural/political divides, it really does remind me of the EU referendum, where no one on the leave side had an agreement as to what the alternative looked like should they win, however legitimate some of their concerns might have been. 

Is the aim to create enough negative noise that Joe Lewis asks Levy to step aside? Because without a new buyer coming in, that seems the only way Levy leaves his position. And if that were to work, with whom is Levy replaced? Another member of the board? They would surely be much in the mould of Levy, presumably. A new member from elsewhere? 

Alternatively, is the aim to get new owners in altogether? Enic are an investment company, so presumably the moment a buyer that matches their current valuation of the club were to come in, they would sell. Given that hasn't happened, Enic Out presumably wish to devalue the club to the point the asking price is lowered and someone else is able to table an acceptable bid. As far as I can tell, the only way to do that is for thousands of ST holders and thousands more on the waiting list to relinquish their tickets and not buy new ones. If the movement was spearheaded under a ""Don't buy, don't renew"" slogan, I would be sympathetic to this but even as unpleasant as the situation is now, I think it would need to get _a lot_ worse for a meaningful number of people to do so and thus reduce the club's value.

And again, we'd have no say in who the new owners would be. The tightened regulations suggested regarding ownership are welcome to me, but I don't think I'm being overly cynical in not expecting them to have the necessary teeth to be effective. We could end up with someone like Boehly, the Glazers, Abu Dhabi or the PIF, none of which I'd prefer to Enic and some of which would make me cut ties with the club altogether.

I'm not trying to be deliberately provocative, I'm sympathetic to the need for change at the club, but whilst the chairman remains a part-owner and the movement against him doesn't provide clear aims and measures of success, it's not something I can get behind. If anyone can lay out the movement's agreed aims and goals - or even a strategy for deciding what they might be - I would be genuinely interested and even convinced to join.

Who do you realistically want? The board have hired and fired a lot of managers within a relatively short space of time and we've had two of the best to ever grace the game. I'm at a loss with Spurs fans no manager ever seems good enough for you. I also feel this is part of the problem and contributes to the rotten culture at the club the fans don't appreciate what they've got.

Play a 3 man midfield, either 4231 or 433 and rotate use a mix of Sarr Skipp H√∏jbjerg Devine. We get brutalised almost every game in midfield and have done for years. We‚Äôd rather sacrifice a midfielder/ attacker for a shit defender instead.",Spurs,Yes,jf0uk36,t1_jf0qglc

In almost any other footballing country, everyone accepts that Doucoure lost his head, and Kane went down to make sure the ref saw what has happened because that increases his team‚Äôs chances of winning. In england this is called cheating? Why? What rule did he break",Spurs,Yes,jf1iigh,t1_jf1hy63
Remember when Nuno subbed Lucas off during El Sackico? Probably a little bit more toxic than that,Spurs,Yes,jf1jluq,t1_jf1ji87
"Lmao, I know this is talk sport but still hilarious https://twitter.com/talkSPORT/status/1643541596623740928?s=20",Spurs,Yes,jf25us0,t1_jf257ah
"Has the club ever laid out a solid plan / strategy to aim for silverware?

No, and I think pinning results on a few individuals is heavily misguided. Football is a team sport. 

I know Kane gets a lot of shite for missing finals or whatnot, but he didn‚Äôt concede a 30 second penalty which allowed Liverpool to sit deep for 90 minutes. 

Not to mention he essentially dragged our CL campaign out of the mud in the groups + nailed Dortmund away. Lloris was also massive in the knockouts that season.",Spurs,Yes,jf33ast,t1_jf2zsxz
Yes but you're not allowed to criticize Kane,Spurs,Yes,jf3qcsf,t1_jf2zsxz
I blame an unfit Kane demanding to play ahead of Moura for the CL finals. His ego and Pochs stubbornness not to bench him will live with the club forever.,Spurs,Yes,jf30m6s,t1_jf2zsxz

"Agreed.  I don't necessarily think it goes well but I feel the same with any other option.

Ultimately Levy cannot afford to have a new manager come in and fail while Poch goes off and wins trophies elsewhere.  They should just do it and close the chapter.",Spurs,Yes,jf100pu,t1_jf0z78x
We don'ta De Servhi,Spurs,Yes,jf0r6bi,t1_jf0lon5
"I'd want to see how he does in a second season in the premier league with Brighton. He looks great, but I'm reminded a little of Martinez's first (exceptional) season at Everton. He inherited a well drilled squad and was able to add a lot of impetus and flair, but it was unsustainable in the long run. I feel De Zerbi is benefitting hugely from inheriting the squad Potter honed for three years. If he can continue to improve or even sustain their current level in this league, then yeah, he's the real deal.",Spurs,Yes,jf0x19d,t1_jf0lon5
"Not getting him either way, why would he leave there so early",Spurs,Yes,jf0mxo0,t1_jf0lon5
"The only reason I can imagine Chelsea would prefer Enrique over Nagelsmann is as Boehly has now been 'burned' by a similar manager. He might see too many parallels between Potter and Julian; both young, upcoming, successful with limited resources, project managers. Not saying those parallels hold true, but just trying to get into Todd's headspace (it's terrifying in here).",Spurs,Yes,jf1iian,t1_jf1gs0v
"Yes, at the end of the season apparently.",Spurs,Yes,jf3gea7,t1_jf3fpqy
We lost 4 if you include Southampton.,Spurs,Yes,jf3nsk0,t1_jf3m2nh
"the problem is thinking of them as 'relegation' teams.  I fear the players do the same, which is why they are comfy sitting on leads.

There is a 9-team dogfight to finish top 6 (edit: 11th-20th, top 6 of this group to avoid relagation).  There is no Norwich/Sheffield/Derby this year.  They are all going to be desperate, and fighting until their end.  

Newcastle today showed how to treat those teams.  Full pressure, force them into mistakes.  Desperate teams can do amazing things - if you let them.

Our squad needs to understand that.",Spurs,Yes,jf3ruuc,t1_jf3m2nh
And yet we've hired an alarming number of defensive managers in that period....,Spurs,Yes,jf3z8sn,t1_jf3mlwu
"Other than those games, City, 2 months ago.",Spurs,Yes,jf3npq7,t1_jf3n8nk
Might need a new winger at this rate,Spurs,Yes,jf1b4mw,t1_jf1atvq
I'd rather have some kind of European tournament because I want to see Spurs play more often,Spurs,Yes,jf0yq0d,t1_jf0uncl
"Europa. It‚Äôs a different tournament to when we were in it last, quality is better with only 32+8 teams and you play fewer games if you win the group. 2012-13 was a pretty enjoyable cup run in it too.

Wouldn‚Äôt touch ECL with the shitty end of a stick though. Play the kids.",Spurs,Yes,jf121mv,t1_jf0uncl
I‚Äôd rather fall out of the Thursday night games for a season. We could focus on a domestic trophy (or two) as well as a proper refocus on becoming a top Premier League side.,Spurs,Yes,jf0vvev,t1_jf0uncl
"I might actually be able to afford Europa League tickets, so that would be nice",Spurs,Yes,jf0w8gj,t1_jf0uncl
No Europa or ECL because our squad can't be bothered to show up and try to win it anyways.,Spurs,Yes,jf0vz0l,t1_jf0uncl
Europa or nothing. Europa as we are not CL level and Conference is waste of time.,Spurs,Yes,jf0zl07,t1_jf0uncl
"given he's not managed in Europe, let alone the premier league, he also represents a massive risk too.",Spurs,Yes,jf1dpq6,t1_jf16w7w
It only gets better when we clear them out.,Spurs,Yes,jf1jnl9,t1_jf1ffmo
"Football is unpredictable. We are a top 6 club, among the 10 richest in the world, with consistent european football, ability to attract players and a huge stadium. Attracting a good enough manager to take us forward will not be a problem. 

Look at the shit situation United were in only a year ago. Look at Arsenal 2-3 years ago. Look at how shit things looked in the summer of 2021 for us, and how happy we were in the summer of 2022. We‚Äôll be back",Spurs,Yes,jf1j12c,t1_jf1ffmo
"I agree. I don't see any change until we either get rid of the Conte friendly staff, or we completely change system (which I don't think stellini will do). Whilst I suspect Conte had ran his course, I also think the players are not suited to, nor happy with, the system we're playing. I am desperate for a new manager to come in asap, but it needs to be the right manager. If we continue down this path till the end of the season we will be in free fall, whether people think that's a good thing in the long run or not is up to them, but I really believe the club is in a mess and the sooner there's a change of (below levy) leadership, with a full support team overhaul (coaches, etc) then it's only going in one direction, in my opinion.",Spurs,Yes,jf1glbf,t1_jf1ffmo
Really. Really? Really! Really...,Spurs,Yes,jf1jt2b,t1_jf1ffmo
cuz money.,Spurs,Yes,jf2a4bp,t1_jf2a05y
"Because as much as Brighton is a stable football club, we are bigger yet we don‚Äôt sack managers for not winning silverware. We would not have sacked Conte if he wasn‚Äôt insufferable and clearly not renewing with us.

I personally think if Levy hires the right staff to assemble a promising sporting project, we can definitely lure the likes of De Zerbi. Problem is whether Levy can accomplish this",Spurs,Yes,jf34gsj,t1_jf2a05y
"Since the team have difficulty to stay motivated in the last 15 minutes against relegation candidate opponents, I kinda feel with Brighton, we got this motivational issue covered. The fighting cock will fight harder, not necessarily guaranteed a win but I expect more interesting match.

"People act like they do nothing lol, just by chance I came across the minutes on one of their recent meetings with the club and discovered they successfully argued for price reductions for the Portsmouth game and for Milan to be a Cat B game rather than Cat A.

Beautiful",Spurs,Yes,jf4jlqa,t1_jf4g69m

Enrique interviewed with them this morning. But yeah it does seem like either him or Nagelsmann will get the job.,Spurs,Yes,jf4r81l,t1_jf45vjk
I don't think I've ever seen Alex Scott play. What's he like? And do you think he'd actually get playing time,Spurs,Yes,jf544sp,t1_jf532wr

"You‚Äôre saying that as if Paratici has not invested in young unproven talents. Bryan Gil, Pape Sarr, Djed Spence, Udogie

Also you can make all these risky lower league signings but eventually these risks won‚Äôt pan out. Before Brighton, there was Leicester, and before Leicester there was Southampton knocking on the door. The latter two are gonna get relegated

IMO our recruitment failures aren‚Äôt really to do with the quality of players. It‚Äôs the failure to set up a good sporting project, which stems from the top. Tony Bloom has set a fantastic example",Spurs,Yes,jf7p31o,t1_jf4c16b
It's been like this for 3 years,Spurs,Yes,jf3oeaz,t1_jf3mtdy

If lampard succeeds at Chelsea in his interim role and boehly is dumb enough to hire him then that would be amazing,Spurs,Yes,jf2wenm,t1_jf2w0tj
"There is definitely a personnel issue as well, not just tactically. This group just isn‚Äôt solid enough technically.

For example, we don‚Äôt have enough players who can maintain possession under pressure. Only our recent signings like Kulu, Romero, Porro are capable. 

We need better ball carrying forwards/mids. We also miss an Eriksen type with incredible passing vision to open the pitch. Maddison, Alex Scott can be good for us.",Spurs,Yes,jf2uuyp,t1_jf2dj9v
"If it is true that Pochettino, Spalletti, De Zerbi, Nagelsmann and Enrique have already said no to us.

You can see why this club wants him.",Spurs,Yes,jf1n2vc,t1_jf1lven
"Because, at least speaking for myself who is Poch in, I miss enjoying watching Spurs and miss having a positive feeling about being a supporter. 

We've endured the most dire, boring football and miserable managers since Poch went. 

I just want to return to not feeling like watching spurs is a job or a chore. 

His last year and a hit went sour, but we lost Dembele, Eriksen wanted out, Dele gave up and Jan and Toby passed their prime.... Yet he still took us to a CL final. 

The squad, whilst still needing more, has improved a lot with players like Romero, Hojbjerg, Bentancur and Deki. But the negative, defensive tactics not only fail to get the best out of them, it's awful to watch. Poch can bring the best out.",Spurs,Yes,jf1p1yx,t1_jf1lven
">His last year and a half was so bad a lot of people wanted him sacked.

Yesh I'm sure everyone wanted to sack him when he got us top 4 and to a UCL final with no signings",Spurs,Yes,jf1o4s8,t1_jf1lven
He is the best manager that would want to be here. Also the point of mending the soul of club. His last 1.5 years was bad because the squad wasn't refreshed timely. His style of play would required us to refresh the squad but levy chose to keep the players over him. Lo and behold he was correct and we ultimately had to commit to the rebuild.,Spurs,Yes,jf1xvp8,t1_jf1lven

No. This is a horrible take,Spurs,Yes,jf1qp1p,t1_jf1pras
"There's a not-so-fine line between *I'm looking at the bright side if we miss out on Europe entirely* and *I would rather us to finish worse than 7th this season than better*.

They have more money so they attract better coaches and players",Spurs,Yes,jf35p51,t1_jf30gde
"The negativity stems from the fact that they have concrete links/made progress in their managerial search while we‚Äôre stuck with a banned DoF and the assistant manager of the guy we just fired.

A shame ENIC's over the top valuation seemed to have killed any further talks regarding the takeover.",Spurs,Yes,jf0x8ei,t1_jf0w54l

I'd rather us have someone who has the chance to be a great manager and doesn't have those personality traits.",Spurs,Yes,jf19439,t1_jf172pw
"It‚Äôs snobbery imo. If Slot got fired from a PL team then no one would want him. Foreign players and managers are always more exciting because we only ever hear the positives. But if we bought in someone that the fans really don‚Äôt want, like Potter or Rodgers, the fans won‚Äôt take long to get on their back and there‚Äôs no real recovery from there. Whatever happens in the summer with the DoF, manager and Kane, we need to come out of it with a positive feel around the club otherwise the negativity will consume us.",Spurs,Yes,jf196ih,t1_jf172pw
"His tactics are dated. It‚Äôs as simple as that. Apparently he‚Äôs a good man manager and does prefer attacking football, but that‚Äôs where the good stuff stops.",Spurs,Yes,jf1ciea,t1_jf172pw

He is a bit of a cunt.,Spurs,Yes,jf17c95,t1_jf172pw
"Well yeah, obviously.  Although it might be a bit different to what you suggest.

What do you suppose they are doing?  Absolutely nothing?

Obviously they need to check everything about a potential coach that they possibly can.  Imagine they approach someone and then some historic issue comes to light.  Look at what happened with Gattuso.  Look at Paratici.  I doubt they are basing the search on Twitter and Reddit and a bit of sky sports.

You can't have it both ways, either they should have done their due diligence or they shouldn't bother but I am sure everybody will find a reason to cry like a baby either way.",Spurs,Yes,jf1j671,t1_jf1i92j
Yeah cause they know they‚Äôll get the blame if they don‚Äôt finish where they should,Spurs,Yes,jf2zjrn,t1_jf2vyjp
Why do you need info if he's going to Chelsea?,Spurs,Yes,jf1h6r1,t1_jf15d4o
"That's another thing, all the people saying we should sell him for whatever reason, I think are insane! Either you get someone in and then sell Kane and everything he is and represents, immediately undermining the new manager's chance of success. Or you have managers understandably hesitant to take the job because of that uncertainty.

Well, yeah, but imo he's been found out and was out of his depth at Chelsea, their squad issues aside.",Spurs,Yes,jf0nmq7,t1_jf0na18

"I don't even think it's that, I mean there's plenty of reasons. It just feels like it has to be the right man, and everyone apart from Poch have too many issues that I'm finding it hard to be enthusiastic about any of them",Spurs,Yes,jf0nbr5,t1_jf0n2v1
"To be fair I think the way we sang Conte's name meant a lot to him at first and we showed a huge amount of faith in him before everything started turning sour, and he started to rot the club to its core.
I agree with what you're saying in principle but the 'best managers in the game' were brought in to win and both ended up playing crap negative football. I don't think sacking Mou or Conte was ultimately the fans' fault in any way shape or form!

I think and would hope if we brought in Poch or De Zerbi then the entire club would get behind a rebuilding of the club's approach and culture and the fans would also be much more patient.
I'd rather we play good football and show signs of promise and progression but be 7th than be 7th playing prison football like we do now!",Spurs,Yes,jf0wthm,t1_jf0t23u

"Stop buying into this ‚Äúcereal winner‚Äù shit please it‚Äôs 2023. Mourinho was finished for years before he came to Tottenham, we didn‚Äôt break shit.

And Conte had an amazing first season and a mediocre second season. Not a total failure, we didn‚Äôt break him either",Spurs,Yes,jf12wx2,t1_jf0yy4n

"Lol it doesn't matter what you do. Unless games literally get canceled because of protests, you think they'll care? Tickets will be sold out even if they had increased the price. Too many casual/content consumers for anything to happen",Spurs,Yes,jf3s8rc,t1_jf3q3cq
Absolute keyboard warrior.,Spurs,Yes,jf3swlf,t1_jf3q3cq
How many fucking times do we have the manager in charge turn down a good signing the club has scouted,Spurs,Yes,jf289d2,t1_jf1q64o
This is misinformation. What is the source?,Spurs,Yes,jf1p7qu,t1_jf1ohsh

"I agree with you 100%, we‚Äôve mismanaged the transition to a new keeper and now his legacy is being tarnished because he‚Äôs aging out and underperforming. Finding a new first choice keeper was a job that needed doing two years ago.",Spurs,Yes,jf16ypr,t1_jf0rv7f
"Stellini/Conte/Mason should be tried for war crimes for the amount of times he's come on as a sub in the last 4 months of his contract. New signings and young players rotting on the bench while this Bolsonaro-loving vibe merchant wails his limbs about

"Look what he did at AZ though, he'll make their lives miserable if they deny him a move or try and ask for a kings ransom. He'll be desperate to go and has already shown he's not shy about burning bridges to get out. Feyenoord will be compensated but it won't be expensive, nor will his wages be as a 4th year manager making a massive move for his first job ever outside of the Netherlands.",Spurs,Yes,jf1lpja,t1_jf1l1yx
"Perisic is 100% getting torched multiple times down his side. This game would be perfect for a calm, level-headed LWB like Davies but unfortunately Conte‚Äôs training has run half of this squad into the ground and caused multiple injuries.",Spurs,Yes,jf41a07,t1_jf3u9uj
"It's similar to how we play our matches that I'm seeing. It's a soft opponent so we play soft and expect wins. No matter how much more talent we have, it's still an 11 on 11. We have to play with intensity in every match.",Spurs,Yes,jf4mf4o,t1_jf4lr47
Wonderful news,Spurs,Yes,jf2uc4p,t1_jf2tqhe
Hope its true. He is a great talent.,Spurs,Yes,jf2vqxr,t1_jf2tqhe
Only thing being monitored currently is that crook Director both by the club and the authorities to see if he ends up in prison.,Spurs,Yes,jf2mq1n,t1_jf2j97u
Manager tactics is the reason. Perisic on his own is not the worst footballer on the pitch.,Spurs,Yes,jf2ek3g,t1_jf1zi0h
"Does he? 

Still a relatively unproven manager who struggled to cement success with one of the best squad lists in the world. 

Mourinho and Conte possess a CV that Poch doesn't even come close to. Aside from sentimentality, no, he doesn't deserve the same wage level that those two had.",Spurs,Yes,jf1nmw8,t1_jf1de6z

"Wasn't ""talksport sources understand"" the reliable one?",Spurs,Yes,jf2l54s,t1_jf25us0
"This sub will do literally anything to excuse Levy, its amazing. You don't think it was gutting the academy and loaning out one or two youth players per year for 6 years, being the only club in the history of the PL who went a summer without a transfer or refusing to move on from deadwood or unsettled players that did it? It was Kane being selfish? Which literally every professional striker on earth is?

This is why a single supporter should have not a bad word to say about Kane when he puts in his request. Moan about disrespect from the media and have the gall to say he's the reason the club is in shambles. It'd be genuinely hilarious to go back in time and see what happened if we made Kanes loan deal at Leicester permanent where this club would be with Levy at the wheel and without the best striker in PL history.",Spurs,Yes,jf32e7t,t1_jf30m6s
Any player would be desperate to play. That's all on Poch.,Spurs,Yes,jf32ze8,t1_jf30m6s

"Nagelsmann is very young, has just failed at a big club and I can see how they would be concerned given his apparent issues with the dressing room there.

Enqrique has succeeded at a big club and has history at both Madrid and Barca so in football terms there is a big difference of experience.

I've no idea who is better.",Spurs,Yes,jf1jmg1,t1_jf1iian
No it‚Äôs Lampard!,Spurs,Yes,jf3h16f,t1_jf3gea7
Good,Spurs,Yes,jf3k82p,t1_jf3gea7
"Nah. Son and Deki would love playing for Poch (again in son's case). He'd get them playing freely and they'd be terrorising the opposition. 

Son and Deki aren't remotely at fault for their form this season. When your an attack minded, goal threat but told to play deep and get the ball just outside your own box all the time, there's nothing you can do.",Spurs,Yes,jf1prfk,t1_jf1b4mw
"Risky like Arteta, ETH, Klopp who have never managed in England before they did",Spurs,Yes,jf227pl,t1_jf1dpq6

"It's really our only hope. Brighton are superior in every single way with respect to the football side of the club from top to bottom. Tony Bloom has set up an organisation that raises the level of everyone involved, whereas we are a machine thatt drags great people down thanks to executive incompetence. If I'm a manager I'm sticking with them rather than walk out and join this absolute clown show",Spurs,Yes,jf2hfa2,t1_jf2a4bp
"He can't because if he could, he would have done many many times before. He is incapable of creating a sustainable football organisation because he cannot overcome his own flaws and ego. He's too small a person to let the club succeed on a football pitch.",Spurs,Yes,jf39r91,t1_jf34gsj
Yeah I meant 3-4-3. Dont know what I was thinking while writing the original comment.,Spurs,Yes,jf178q5,t1_jf1744t

MSN tax,Spurs,Yes,jf1mx1p,t1_jf1loom
"I honestly feel even if a keeper is just ""not bad"" with his feet it's completely fine. We don't need a keeper like ederson. Shot stopping should be the biggest focus when we are looking for a keeper. Forster is also ""not bad"" with the ball at his feet and it made so much difference to us playing out from the back compared to lloris who is a liability completely.",Spurs,Yes,jf2p267,t1_jf2mpnp
Very similar to Maddison. Would be shocked if we got both personally.,Spurs,Yes,jf57c93,t1_jf544sp
Dribbly boi,Spurs,Yes,jf55c18,t1_jf544sp
That's most of the noise coming out of the club about the situation,Spurs,Yes,jf2hh40,t1_jf2346j
"I mean... I know Romero has passion and skill and I really like him but his regular daft decisions mean that he shouldn't be thought of as untouchable. He played an absolutely stupid pass to Dier just last game. But yes, of all your players him and Bentancaur are probably the closest to untouchable as you can get.

Porro is promising going forward but there are some many question marks regarding his ability to defend. He shouldn't be thought of has untouchable even though he is the shiny new toy.",Spurs,Yes,jf3qunl,t1_jf3nzs4
"I know I know, didn‚Äôt want him anyway but his attitude is making me jealous, just seem so jovial",Spurs,Yes,jf2ro17,t1_jf2rbsj
"Yeah definitely, I wouldn‚Äôt put it past Levy thinking the same. It‚Äôs a shame because clubs like Chelsea, Liverpool & United still clearly value the Europa League enough to go all the way and yet Spurs just seem to throw it away every time.",Spurs,Yes,jf3uk0r,t1_jf3tmo3
"Jokes aside, fourth biggest in England until recently. Genuinely interested to see which English club completes the collection first, now Conference League is added. Likely Liverpool or Chelsea at this rate.",Spurs,Yes,jf3t10v,t1_jf3rxdx
Benta is good too.,Spurs,Yes,jf313w4,t1_jf2uuyp
I prefer Slot over Potter and Rodgers.. no shit. I wouldnt be unhappy with him but I think we should prefer others.,Spurs,Yes,jf2e85p,t1_jf2a1jv
Getting nuno instead of anyone else was a massive fuckup,Spurs,Yes,jf3tigy,t1_jf3tatc
"I agree he is a better option than everyone you mentioned but there are better candidates than him-That‚Äôs my point. 

Who said the club want him?",Spurs,Yes,jf1navq,t1_jf1n2vc
"I agree with wanting to watch exciting football and all that but my point is that during his end it was not positive football. We just had tons of possession with no end product and that became boring. We werent a threat and I remember that Newcastle game being the prime example. 

Who knows? Maybe things might be better but managers rarely change. I‚Äôd rather move on to a newer manager and project. Poch is still the best manager we‚Äôve had in a long time but that doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôll go back to competing for trophies if he returns",Spurs,Yes,jf1q144,t1_jf1p1yx
Do you not remember? During that miraculous ucl run we were inconsistent in the league and in danger of missing ucl. We had horrible performances that carried over to the next season which caused him to be fired. His sacking wasn‚Äôt completely reactionary. A lot of people saw it coming.,Spurs,Yes,jf1oikt,t1_jf1o4s8
"My only fear with this is that Liverpool are probably going to commit to a rebuild this summer so they don‚Äôt lose Klopp, and I think they‚Äôd be targeting a similar profile of player as we‚Äôd require if Poch was brought in.",Spurs,Yes,jf3c1cw,t1_jf1xvp8
"I agree with the rebuild of the squad. That was a huge missed opportunity but instead of bringing him back with a good portion of the same players, especially on defence, and hoping things will be better this time around when the club is , isn‚Äôt it better to move on? There‚Äôs no guarantee that what he needs will be granted and that also doesn‚Äôt mean we will be back to competing if that happens. The league has improved therefore the competition. 

Also, the performances were not just down to needing a rebuild. Some of those losses and performances were constant and also highlighted one of his biggest flaws in his lack of tactical astuteness and nuance. You could just tell he didn‚Äôt have a backup plan when things went wrong. Who knows? Maybe he addressed that during his time away but he hasn‚Äôt managed in a while so idk",Spurs,Yes,jf22dsr,t1_jf1xvp8
You think Chelsea will hold onto a manager for three years?,Spurs,Yes,jf0w6t2,t1_jf0vdrp
when we play Chelsea at home next season,Spurs,Yes,jf1ordl,t1_jf1066m
"It already has. Liepzig beat us comfortably in 2020. 

In our defence we were missing kane and son and had Dele Alli leading the line",Spurs,Yes,jf25lsy,t1_jf1066m
The recruitment aspect is particularly important. Much easier to accelerate a rebuild with decent quality players if you have at least *some* type of European football to offer.,Spurs,Yes,jf39h96,t1_jf1qas2
"Honestly if he did this, he would rake in billions

Charge to watch, charge to participate...think about how many thousands of people would sign up for one round with tiny-boned Danny boy...it's a solid gold plan",Spurs,Yes,jf2k5y7,t1_jf2jw27
"Used to be ""Facey"" when we were kids, he's changed",Spurs,Yes,jf2jhwh,t1_jf2j39b
Agreed.,Spurs,Yes,jf1y549,t1_jf1xo2m
good point.,Spurs,Yes,jf1yqfb,t1_jf1yeh6
Exactly. You can get basically any manager you want if the check is large enough. Same with players.,Spurs,Yes,jf38apo,t1_jf35p51
"But it seems like we sacked Conte out of need - it was toxic and he had a meltdown. So we went with a (hopefully) sustainable succession plan approach of caretaker + due diligence for long-term appointment that fits needs.

Chelsea have proven, since the sacking of Tuchel, that they have NO plan. 

Just because the media has no leaks to report from us doesn't mean people are doing their job. They paint this narrative of incompetence when they don't get stories because they have nothing else to go on and it's clickbait fuel for the LevyOut crew. Tottenham could still easily prove me wrong with how they do this, but the silence is not indicative of something bad.

The Fab situation throws a wrench in everything, but I think we are giving journos too much weight when they are under pressure to write (and have nothing) and it's pushing this narrative of incompetence that factually is not accurate.

Look at Everton's ownership for the last decade. Look at the teams in the championship getting docked points for regulation violations. Look at what happened to Sunderland. We are not in those positions. 

Even the fab thing is getting too much weight. FIFA and all of the regulation bodies are notoriously corrupt and incompetent. To expect them to actually issue punishments with any sort of weight is genuinely shocking. From what I can tell, it's largely hindsight reporting without clear and obvious parallel precedents to draw from.",Spurs,Yes,jf34bgq,t1_jf32gwq
"You‚Äôre probably right. I just wish we actually had a succession plan before we sacked Conte. With the contract situation Levy should‚Äôve been thinking about this in January, now chances are we‚Äôre gonna land another Nuno.",Spurs,Yes,jf0x5bz,t1_jf0wvrp
They really are the next Wolves lmao,Spurs,Yes,jf291vx,t1_jf1o77u

Pitt-Brooke mentioned on the view from the lane that the club may be trying to be as quiet (aka leakproof) as possible in their search this time to avoid the scathing reviews they got during the pre-Nuno manager search when they went through and lost out or reversed on so many targets.

Totally. We‚Äôd all love Sergio Ramos if he was at our club. It‚Äôs the same thing.,Spurs,Yes,jf41dty,t1_jf40v76
"Yeah he was just criminally mis, and under, used under Conte.

Problem with managers like Conte is they have 1 system and a very specific profile of player that will make that system work. He probably saw some attributes in Richy that he thought he could use, but a combination of factors meant that wasn‚Äôt possible.

I think it‚Äôs for the best anyway as his attitude indicates he‚Äôll be hungry to make a proper mark next season. There are a few players who Conte couldn‚Äôt get ticking, so under the right manager who isn‚Äôt obsessed with hammering square pegs into round holes and is actually capable of tweaking their system to get the most out of players, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be an unqualified success here. Before he inevitably moves to Madrid or PSG or something anyway.

Still baffling to me how there‚Äôs not a single player that you can definitively say improved under Conte this season. The man is meant to be one of the best managers in the world, FFS",Spurs,Yes,jf6i7k4,t1_jf410jr
"Well, given the edit and new questions he is very highly regarded and supported by the fans here. They agreed with him on Conte and mostly his performance stuff has been injury related. Our best moment of the year (for me) was his CL goals and crying with his dad and his bicycle kick in the World Cup.

You may guess from my username I'm biased though, I've followed and admired him since he was playing for you under Silva",Spurs,Yes,jf3y2v0,t1_jf3x540

"Come on man, that's so disingenuous. Risky means it could go either way. You've pretty conveniently picked managers at three of the most successful clubs who are unlikely to massively underperform anyway.

Well there you go! Some belief. We also beat City. I agree we look shit atm but we have a lot of points. Just have to play better the rest of the season or have some luck in our side in our matches.

"I guess Flick is also a bad manager too by those metrics. International football is a different beast and managers who come in with complicated tactical schemes struggle, and personally I thought Spain played well considering the style they were trying to play.   


Pep if he went into international management would also be exposed similarly. Same with Arteta. You need to be defensively tight and not be afraid to counter attack in international football, and that Spain squad was not built for that playstyle at all. It's why Morocco went so far and so did France, both teams had solid defences and were deadly on the counter.",Spurs,Yes,jf3ygsn,t1_jf3tm20

And yet you‚Äôre having a lot of trouble grasping. Glad everyone could help.,Spurs,Yes,jf2bsq1,t1_jf1lp0i
To me he's irreplaceable and I'd rather have another year of goals and a small chance he could stay rather than inevitably wasting whatever money we got for him and seeing him score in another shirt,Spurs,Yes,jf0p69v,t1_jf0ojg5
"No player, other than those retiring from the game, should be allowed to run their contract down. Sign a one-year extension or move on. For as good at business as Levy is this is a huge blind spot in the management of the club.

Transfer fees paid to bring players in are reflective of the market value of that asset at the time. Likewise transfer fees out. What we paid has no bearing on what price we can sell. When we hold on to players we are in fact saying that we would be willing to pay the market fee for the remainder of their contract including any signed extensions. In the event an extension won‚Äôt be signed, it is like paying a loan fee and agreeing to pay full salary.

For example, Davinson Sanchez‚Äôs contract runs down in 2024. He earns ¬£65k per week. If we reject an offer of a ¬£5M transfer fee he would accept then we are saying we would agree to pay ¬£5M and ¬£65k per week for a one year loan of Sanchez. The rub here is that Sanchez is not likely to earn ¬£65k per week on a new contract and might see running down his contract and collecting a fee on his next as good business. Nevertheless, that should be the club‚Äôs math.

Kane‚Äôs situation is different. On ¬£200k per week and likely to see a substantial bump in a new contract. Conversely he has significant risk of age and injury in running down his contract. Would Spurs pay ¬£50M an ¬£200k per week for a one season loan of Harry Kane? Of course not. Then sell to the highest bidder he‚Äôll accept unless he extends.

Ideally any 2024 contract players should have been extended, in the shop window, or agreed to run down last summer and we should be doing be preparing this exercise for the class of 2025.

2024: Kane, Sanchez, Dier, Perisic, Winks, Forster, Lloris, Austin.

2025: Son, Sessegnon, Reguilon, Ndombele, Lo Celso, Davies, Tanganga, Rodon, Whiteman.  FFS at this vintage.",Spurs,Yes,jf1bayo,t1_jf0o01v

Last night we struggled to keep possession against 10 man Everton. They figured out that even with a one man disadvantage, our system would be vulnerable to a high press - even one as basic and untested as one employed by a Dyche team. That really highlights how deeply systemic the problem is. 

Two weeks ago we could barely string two passes against Saints. Rewind back to November, when we beat Forrest, they blew us away with their pressing. We have a lot of injuries and some good players going through a bad patch of form. First team needs some upgrade. But I think it's individuals who have, in spite of the system, kept us afloat this season.",Spurs,No,jewsplt,t3_12b9ifz
"My 2 cents on last night.

First 10 mins the game was chaotic. Very much felt like the players wanted to prove a point. Trouble is, it was more like running around like headless chickens ""pressing"".

This comes about from not pressing all season. Sitting back allowing the opponent to dominate possession is the way we have played for months. Rightly or wrongly that's how we play. 

The problems of playing that way were highlighted in embarrassing fashion when we went 1 up. I have honestly never seen a capitulation in composure like that from any team, ever.

This Everton side had scored 12 goals at home I think. 1 up against 10 men is game over. I cannot understand for a second how we just didn't keep the ball outside of our own 3rd.

The match thread was full of blaming individuals. ""Lloris played a horrible pass to Romero"" is one example. The point is, Lloris should never be receiving the ball in that position at that point in the game. Keep ball is not for the back 5 it's for the front 3 in that situation.

Not one of that defensive unit are capable of playing out from the back.

The build up play in this side is absolutely mind numbing. The reason Son has been shit all season and why Deki has gone off the boil is nothing to do with Perisic starting. It's because they are constantly receiving the ball with back to goal. A creative MF doesn't solve this issue. Put Eriksen in that MF and we would have the same issues because the progression from back to front is so fucking slow that the opponent is set on their 18 yard line by the time we hit the final 3rd.

I have seen us lose 2, 3 nil and play a million times better than that absolute shambles last night.

You can't sit on a 1-0 lead when your defence is shit. I know this without being paid 15m a year to fix it.

Roll on GW38 because I can't wait for this horror story season to end. I want my Tottenham back. I want Poch back. I want to enjoy watching us taking games by the scruff of the neck and being relentless. This just isn't it.

"Pretty confused about some of the takes on the game.

Alasdair Gold didn't think Lloris or the defence was a problem because Everton didn't create big chances. I don't see how anyone could think that. Lloris was absolutely shocking on the ball, arguably the main reason we fell apart in the second half and lost control of the match was because the passing out the back was atrocious and consistently put us under pressure, and that all starts from the goalkeeper playing suicide passes to defenders. Nervousness in a keeper spreads quickly throughout the team.

What's worse is Stellini had clearly intended for this to be a tactic, we were short passing a lot more from the back, presumably with the intention of dragging Everton onto us. But if you do that you simply cannot start Lloris as he can't play football, you cannot push Dier into the midfield as he doesn't have the close control/mobility/composure, and you CANNOT bring on Davinson fucking Sanchez at left centre back. Terrible decisions all round. Forster had to start, they bottled it.

Our defenders didn't help themselves - Lenglet was very shaky as per, Dier was clearly ordered to move up into midfield but he doesn't have the ability and it nearly cost us, Romero played a couple of suicide passes straight to an Everton forward on the edge of the box. Skipp and Hojbjerg couldn't hold on to possession. It was all terrible. Our coaches were exasperated but they only have themselves to blame because again it all starts with Lloris, Dier, and our midfielders who can't beat a press. The only reason Everton didn't score from any of these gifts was their lack of quality and lack of a striker.",Spurs,No,jezqyox,t3_12b9ifz

"I said this here maybe a couple years ago but Spurs always seem like a fairytale with a shocking twist ending every time.

Pochettino comes in and makes us worldbeaters, brings us to a UCL final and gets us in multiple title races. Surely we break the trophy drought?

Levy doesn't give Pochettino a single signing for a whole year, we lose the Champions league because of a shocking handball decision, we stumble and fall in every title race we get ourselves into.

Pochettino gets sacked but we bring in Jose Mourinho, the man that won the Champions league with fucking Porto and a treble with Inter Milan. We salvage what we can from the season he joins us, and we start the next season brilliantly, landing us on top of the table at one point and we reach the carabao cup final, beating Chelsea on the way. Kane is having the best season of his life. Can we finally go the distance with a winner at the helm?

Mourinho isn't given the signings he wants, his system gets figured out and the mentality of our defenders falls off a cliff never to return. We fall miserably from the title race, crash out of the Europa league in an embarassing fashion, and Jose gets sacked right before the Carabao cup final so Levy can save face from his shocking decision regarding the super league.

We make some solid signings in the off-season like Romero, get a Director of football who seems to know what he's doing, but we make the wrong appointment, which the board quickly realises and sack him for Antonio Conte, the man who brought Inter Milan to their first Scudetto in ages the previous season and was the man to beat us in one of our aforementioned title race stumbles. We find some absolute gems in the January market in Kulusevski and Bentancur. They bring us to a new level and we have some magical games along the way to beating Arsenal 3-0 at home, which shatters their mentality and we secure top 4 ahead of them on the final Matchday, with Sonny winning the golden boot. We kick on in that summer and look to have one of the best transfer windows in our history. We also begin the next season with our best points tally in our pl history, and although the football doesn't look great right now, just imagine how many points we'll be racking up when we start playing good?

We fucking crumble again. Conte's system is atrocious and fails to utilise some of our best assets like Son. The summer signings are either injured or play like shit. Even Perisic, who seemed to start well, he's gotten worse and worse as the season's gone on. Arsenal are flying at the top of the table and will most likely win the league bar a major fuck-up. We sack Conte but keep his backroom staff which provides nothing but the same shit without the childish outbursts in pressers. And to top it all off, our new director of football is literally a criminal and the only way he can legally still work is if he gets off on a legal technicality.

"I just have to write down my thoughts and get it out of my system. Feel free to read and agree/disagree with me. 

I feel like the Everton match could likely end up defining how the rest of the season will look like. It was Stellini‚Äôs first game fully in charge without any involvement from Conte. It was his chance to prove himself standing completely on his own legs (alongside Ryan Mason of course), but it was also a chance for the players to step up and take responsibility. A win away at goodison park would have been a great boost in morale and add momentum, everyone could rally strongly behind Stellini in the push for 4th place. A loss would have made the morale drop even lower and further add to the frustration in this already messy situation the club is in. It was a draw, but it feels like a loss based on how we played. 

The players did not step up and show that burning desire to reach top 4. I thought Everton was playing quite well, but they were down to 10 men for 30 minutes and we wouldn‚Äôt have scored unless we got that penalty. How is it possible to play so poorly and inviting them back into the game despite being one man up? Tottenham players always crack under pressure and it‚Äôs so disappointing to see. The amount of mistakes our players make is quite frankly embarrassing. 

The use of subs also proved to be terrible. I have an enormous respect and admiration for Stellini for taking on this task. He seems like a nice guy who genuinely cares about the club and his demeanor is very different from Conte. But he is not very different from Conte when it comes to game management. To be fair that is to be expected considering the fact that he spent most of his career as Conte‚Äôs right hand man. The tactics are the same, the players are the same, the coaching staff are the same, how much can reasonably be expected to change? The long list of injuries isn‚Äôt making the situation any easier. 

That being said however I cannot for the life of me understand why he picked Moura over Danjuma again despite him having no future in the club. With Danjuma there is at least an option to buy so he could potentially be a part of the future if he was actually given a chance to bloody play! Yesterday it showed why bringing in Moura is a terrible idea, he‚Äôs done good things for the club but he simply isn‚Äôt good enough to rely on any more. 

If this performance was any indication of what is to come then I think unfortunately our chances of making top 4 is over. I just can‚Äôt see it. If you‚Äôre playing with an extra man for 30 minutes but still can‚Äôt even beat Everton you don‚Äôt deserve top 4. Our players continue to crumble under pressure time and time again. With United and Newcastle having less games played than us as well it will be nearly impossible.

If Kane and Son leave it would be terrible but maybe neccessary for a successful rebuild. The squad needs a new core with a different mentality.",Spurs,No,jewd1fg,t3_12b9ifz
"I genuinely want Brighton to fucking destroy us next. Anything to embarrass and upset Daniel Levy. 
Fuck these players bar maybe 3 or 4 of them

Lloris 
Dier

Lucas
Sessegnon

All of these definitely need to leave.",Spurs,No,jewnwxt,t3_12b9ifz
"I would have preferred real Conte rather than this Fraud-Conte. At least, the pressers were rad. Levy, you idiot!",Spurs,No,jew1f5v,t3_12b9ifz
"Not trying to be provocative here, but would love to know what the ENIC/Levy out crowd think Levy should have done differently since Poch left. Here are all the critisims i can think of (ill do my best to put them in order):   
Blowing the Jack Grealish transfer  
sacking Jose before a cup final  
Hiring Paratici possibly knowing he could be a criminal  
Nuno.  
appointing former Everton recruitment chief Steinsson as performance director  


feel free to add anything i may have missed. Personally i think he has done everything he can, he has responded to criticisms of the fans by taking more of a hands-off approach over the past few years. He has hired a DOF and actually backed Conte, what more could you want?",Spurs,No,jewgdzg,t3_12b9ifz
Unpopular opinion but I would happily welcome Potter. I am willing to not count his stint at Chelsea against him. Some of the positional choices he made were questionable (James at RCB) but besides that I think he did as well as you could possibly expect for taking over that dumpster fire halfway though the season,Spurs,No,jew0emf,t3_12b9ifz
[deleted],Spurs,No,jex6qal,t3_12b9ifz
"A small part of me would love to see Sean Dyche in charge, if only until the end of the season. 
Our football would still be just as dire, but at least you know he‚Äôd only pick players who would die for the cause. It‚Äôs been a while since we‚Äôve seen that from our team.",Spurs,No,jew26uu,t3_12b9ifz
Is anybody else not quite ready for Poch to come back yet? Neither he nor us have been nearly as successful as we would have liked since he left and  if he came back now and it didn‚Äôt work out that might actually kill me.,Spurs,No,jew0px9,t3_12b9ifz
What makes you think Kompany is better than Nuno? Do you remember Championship in the 2017/2018 season?,Spurs,No,jewxmuu,t3_12b9ifz
"So, the consensus is a 3-4-3 wingback system is limiting, redundant, bad, so, would we still want Nagelsmann as he also prefers a wingback system? He played 3-1-4-2/ 3-4-3/3-1-6 wingback set-ups at Leipzig, Bayern, Hoffenheim.",Spurs,No,jew66vi,t3_12b9ifz
"This season is honestly embarrassing. Luckily I'm in Houston where nobody really gives a fuck about the Premier League so I don't have to hide in public in shame.

Thoughts on Southgate?,Spurs,No,jeymf92,t3_12b9ifz
"Either we are overestimating our midfielders or the game has changed to such a degree that 5-2-3 just isn't viable at all anymore.

Perfectly stated. This has been the issue since Poch's final season,Spurs,Yes,jew2di0,t1_jew10w8
"That is down to coaching.  Our squad is full of international players.

Why is it when some relegation fodder team gets a new coach they can suddenly all play a different way but apparently our players have no basic footballing skills?  They are told to play the way they do.

I have no doubt we need some transfers in particular GK, CB and CM all who can pass but the core of our squad is good enough to play decent football, just they're not going to suddenly be Brazil without at least being coach to play that way.",Spurs,Yes,jew58n8,t1_jew10w8
I don‚Äôt buy it. The team can‚Äôt play out of a press because they haven‚Äôt been taught to do it. The team is a reflection of your manager,Spurs,Yes,jew30v4,t1_jew10w8
Amazing squad building by Paratici. What a DoF,Spurs,Yes,jew4c16,t1_jew10w8
"Man Lloris is so bad at passing out from the back. The correct pass in that situation would be to hit a strongly weighted pass to Skipp who should receive it on the half turn. Instead, he hits a limp pass to Romero when there's an Everton player near the passing lane. If the player (can't make out who he is from the potato quality) was switched on in that scenario he would have easily cut that pass out and created a dangerous turnover.  


Edit: Holy shit I just realised Skipp even called for the ball ffs",Spurs,Yes,jewjnb2,t1_jewhu78
Battered by 10 men mind you!,Spurs,Yes,jex5wmw,t1_jex0pe4
"I wouldn't say it was worse than much of the other shit we've endured this season... 

To me it was one of those games where, yet again, I wasn't really invested in the match.

Our passiveness and inability to play football which is entertaining just makes me not care. I didn't care when we scored, and just laughed when Keane scored. We knew it was coming.

How the fuck is a team that is (somehow) going to finish in the top 7, parking the bus and blindly clearing the ball (Hojbjerg, looking at you) when we have an **EXTRA PLAYER** against a relegation team on a 1-0 lead?

I don't really blame Stellini at this point - this method is all he knows. He got sacked by a Serie B team by playing the same way. It's not his fault he's still employed. It's on Levy.",Spurs,Yes,jex25ze,t1_jex0pe4
Great decision keeping Conte's staff...,Spurs,Yes,jex1cdc,t1_jex0pe4
Isn't Ferguson the same age as Scarlett too? Ferguson physique looks like that of a 25 year old man.,Spurs,Yes,jeyfnk1,t1_jeyf7f0
Name one player we have in our setup that‚Äôs on Ferguson‚Äôs level lol,Spurs,Yes,jeyfu3w,t1_jeyf7f0
I wonder what the point of sacking Conte was. To appease the supporters who would be too stupid to figure out you retained his entire staff?,Spurs,Yes,jexzrql,t1_jexxhzq

**Bold take**,Spurs,Yes,jewcpwa,t1_jew4dv0
"It's because:  
a) Ours happened before theirs. Meaning they're fresh news.

b) We've already hired a temporary setup. The other teams may hire a permanent one asap.

"Honestly I‚Äôd be surprised if we get top 6.  I see us losing to United, Toon and Liverpool.   Quite feasibly Brighton too.  All the hope for top 4 ignores our performances - I wouldn‚Äôt bet on us to beat any side let alone go on a run.",Spurs,Yes,jew0xct,t1_jevurc7

"Playing Sanchez at LCB at this point is like stabbing yourself in the eye repeatedly with a pen and then using it to write ""never play Sanchez at LCB again you fucking moron"" in large letters next to your nicest painting/photo.

The writing has been on the wall for ages.",Spurs,Yes,jewf6fq,t1_jew8q04
Agreed. Need to bring a manager in and have them watch from afar to analyze what the fuck is going on at this club. At least a third of these players are not good enough and we need a major overhaul this summer,Spurs,Yes,jew59ur,t1_jew4vfk
Well the club is being sold in the near future so you don‚Äôt have to worry about ENIC,Spurs,Yes,jew6k61,t1_jew4vfk

We are about a low block vs 10 men.

We are... Tottenham Hotspur.",Spurs,Yes,jewfin8,t1_jew8odt
"I agree, but what winds me up the most is his distrubtion. I have never seen a goalkeeper so one-footed. His distrubition with his left ('strong' foot) is awful as it is. His passes seem to either go out for a throw in or put us under immediate pressure. We need to buy a new set of goalkeepers this summer.",Spurs,Yes,jewjgeq,t1_jewifgn
Because he‚Äôs not fighting for his place. Forster at least would‚Äôve made an effort.,Spurs,Yes,jewj4ij,t1_jewifgn
"We‚Äôve been shit this season don‚Äôt get me wrong.

But if we would have just an average goalkeeper, and not the worst in the league in Hugo Lloris, I am convinced we would have finished top 4. That is how awful he‚Äôs been",Spurs,Yes,jewjt4e,t1_jewifgn
You can't seriously be comparing what Klopp did at Mainz with Kompany.,Spurs,Yes,jey7ijt,t1_jey60v4
"Yeah but we didn't really sack Conte, Levy just did that to get supporters off his ass and kept Contes whole team to run things exactly the same. Not excusing the players but there is a reason no one does that except us.",Spurs,Yes,jeyer6w,t1_jeyeau9
We can't even properly search for the manager as our DoF will be gone in 2 weeks unless some technicality saves his ass. Until then we can't really do any decisions.,Spurs,Yes,jeytrdr,t1_jeyq21b
Really wouldn‚Äôt worry. No one is going to come in now and get us top 4. Would rather someone comes in fresh in the summer so they can hopefully avoid the toxicity of the rest of this season,Spurs,Yes,jeys195,t1_jeyq21b

"I‚Äôm gonna go as far as saying we might‚Äôve won the game with Forster in goal. Outside of the Leicester game, he‚Äôs been playing far better than anything Hugo has done this season. He actually has decent distribution and doesn‚Äôt panic under pressure. I know our defense is shit but having someone like Hugo who shits the bed with his passing doesn‚Äôt help matters",Spurs,Yes,jevyc52,t1_jevutv2
"The thing that annoys me the most about lloris is the amount of goals we concede and he's absolutely rooted to the floor, the shot was far out enough to see coming at least attempt a save my guy",Spurs,Yes,jevwi40,t1_jevutv2
It stands out so much more starkly in a season where teams are using methods to get 4 into the midfield.,Spurs,Yes,jex7pxq,t1_jex6v0w
"I do actually rate Skipp but he had an absolute mare last night and should have been subbed. Then again, who didn't have a mare?",Spurs,Yes,jexg9xo,t1_jex6v0w

"The smartest thing Arsenal have done was Edu backing Arteta with everything he wanted and needed. 

You want to spend 25 mil just to get Auba and Ozil out because you think they aren't good for the dressing room? Done. 

You wanted Cedric, Lokonga, Mari, Willian but they turned out to be shit? We'll get rid of them asap, regardless of the financials involved.

Every big club is run like that. All the pretenders like us, Chelsea and previously Man Utd were run by the higher ups and forcing managers to deal with what they are given, which is why they all turn into shit shows within a couple of years",Spurs,Yes,jewzgvx,t1_jewwslf

We absolutely do deserve it. The last two matches were peak Spurs. We just blew a 2 goal lead and a 1 goal lead with 1 man up in the 90th minute back to back to relegation sides. I mean what more can you say at this point?,Spurs,Yes,jex5xdv,t1_jex5k04

"He had no pace to lose and somehow still lost some off the injury.

Dunno if you move him into the centre or what, but he hasn't got the carrying power for the wing as much any more.",Spurs,Yes,jewpxqq,t1_jewplhb
"I thought Kulusevski was fine yesterday and greatly improved from before the break. 

The issue is that the wings are so imbalanced as Son really provides no threat anymore to teams so they can put more on the right hand side whilst defending then try to win the ball back and switch it to the left hand side where Perisic is playing left wing isolating Lenglet.",Spurs,Yes,jewqjme,t1_jewplhb
Those huddles they have seem so insignificant but they infuriate me so much and I can't explain why,Spurs,Yes,jexmv9w,t1_jexkb5r

"System doesn't work, whether Conte or Stellini uses it.",Spurs,Yes,jewgbh6,t1_jewdeqx
"It's going to be a bumpy few years, and Levy has one more throw of the dice. If he fucks up the next manager appointment, that's it, game over. We could slide back to midtable, not even knee jerking here. Our performances have flattered to decieve for years now. Without Kane, and/or (an in form) Son, well, perish the thought.",Spurs,Yes,jewhmv5,t1_jewdeqx
"> We are shit.

Water is wet.",Spurs,Yes,jewdqko,t1_jewdeqx
"It goes both ways. Individual moments of brilliance are bailing us out and individual errors are costing us points. This is why it‚Äôs so important to shift a ton of players: there is no team, there is no cohesion, there is no unity.",Spurs,Yes,jewubsj,t1_jewsplt
"&#x200B;

Son is very bad as a target.  Great shooter, but very limited otherwise.  I love Sonny, but he is bad defensively, not much of a dribbler, weak as a target.  He is still good at running onto the ball and can shoot/cross with either foot.  He shouldn't start most games.",Spurs,Yes,jewy1zz,t1_jewtmbx
"Yep Son being bad is more on the System more than Perisic. However the System became more of that system when Perisic got here since Perisic needs to push higher up while Son needs to play as a midfielder. 

Such a mess from Conte/Stellini",Spurs,Yes,jewu88t,t1_jewtmbx
"Yeah because now we have another manager hunt, except the good managers we should have gotten back then don't want to come here because it's a shitshow",Spurs,Yes,jexp8um,t1_jexcqlp
"The squad is in better shape now than then but feel we as a club are in a much worse position with less direction and no vision for the future

Think the big thing is that Kane looked certain to leave after that debacle, that was the worst bit for me. Might leave this summer too but we've already gone through all the emotion in 2021 so it'll be less brutal if he does leave

I don't feel better or worse emotionally or psychologically, this is just another day of Spurs. It'll work out how it works out",Spurs,Yes,jexq69d,t1_jexcqlp

"Absolutely not, we have signed few great players since then.",Spurs,Yes,jexhfjc,t1_jexcqlp
Am I missing something with Kompany? Genuine question like has he shown anything as a manager outside of his Burnley team that show he‚Äôs the right man to handle a rebuild for us? And to take such a big step up so fast,Spurs,Yes,jexvtoe,t1_jextw3l
We have actually seen this types of performances and gotten 3 points earlier this season(like Forest). Our luck has run out. You cannot play haram ball for too long and get away with it.,Spurs,Yes,jexo60g,t1_jexm0sj

Get some perspective or get an education. They were bad subs but fucking lmao,Spurs,Yes,jewly3e,t1_jewl10b
Finishing 8 for a couple of seasons wouldn't bother me at all.  It helped Arsenal and it's not like our board is actually reinvesting money into the team anyway.,Spurs,Yes,jewe79b,t1_jewa9mq
"Does it even matter where we finish? If we get any European football, we'll embarrass ourselves vs some farmers once again and Europa/Conference have 0 pull and don't give much money for participation.

"finishing 8th might be the only way we can convince ENIC to sell the club. Maybe its not as bad as we think....

It seems you are spending too much time bantering rival fans on social media mate.,Spurs,Yes,jewfi5x,t1_jewffbf

"It wasn't but I think it was a red.

Can you handle that amount of nuance?",Spurs,Yes,jewxhgt,t1_jeww78y
I remember watching the All or Nothing season with Spurs and when Jose came in his people the first week and he told the players they were too nice.  I think he said they are nice boys but in a game they have to be assholes.  The only player he said who would mix it up was Dier which explains we he likes him so much.,Spurs,Yes,jewtw71,t1_jewnen8
"He is on paid time off until he needs to go to court, which is in like 2-3 weeks, and then we see the outcome. The problem is that he has other cases against him aswell in the future. But i like him tbh.",Spurs,Yes,jew3pqj,t1_jew0xbs

"Premium tickets went up by 10% _but_ it was the first hike in 5 years. So if that's anything to go by then I'd imagine it's no more than 5%, probably closer to 2 or 3. That is a guess though.",Spurs,Yes,jewcu7y,t1_jew8yun
Levy hasn't made money on a transfer since Walker in 2017 right?,Spurs,Yes,jex3qec,t1_jex2r4e
Sanchez being our first sub and it being so late was like the first rider of the apocalypse popping his head up,Spurs,Yes,jexcp0k,t1_jexbdqj
"I think the biggest issue is not only who we use as subs, but when we use them. Most teams bring their first sub on around 60', when I pulled the data last (~30 days ago), we were second to last at 68'.",Spurs,Yes,jexmmtb,t1_jexbdqj
"At least they're, both teams, looking forward and not passing back",Spurs,Yes,jeyt241,t1_jeyosfh

I want to celebrate something this season and that's just about the only thing left,Spurs,Yes,jexgrkh,t1_jexf1f9
"In his first stint as Spain manager, his team were very good to watch, and one of the favs for tournaments before he left for personal reasons.

He's a very good technical coach imo.",Spurs,Yes,jevua8z,t1_jevtjqy
His time at Barce was arguably better than Pep's there too.,Spurs,Yes,jevubbe,t1_jevtjqy
"He's far from my top choice as manager, but I don't think he'd be as bad as you're suggesting.

Enrique completely changed the way Barca played to maximise their talents at the time. Which, yes, including the best front three in history, but we arguably have one of the best frontlines in the EPL.

The thing most people ding him for is endless possession, which honestly is more a function of the crop of players he had with Spain, which was a bunch of small, technical footballers with no proper #9 to score at the end of their pretty moves.

But even if he does prioritise possession football... isn't that something we should be moving towards anyway? We absolutely suck at holding onto the ball, passing through a press, and being calm in possession, which are all things I see Enrique being able to work with us on.

There's a lack of personnel to play 100% Enrique ball for sure, but that's true of any manager who comes in. Our squad is - Kane aside - no longer top six quality, so if he brings in some talented La Liga midfielders who can keep ahold of the ball and not pass it to the opposition every fucking time? Sounds an awful lot better than what we've had for the last few years.",Spurs,Yes,jevwe11,t1_jevtjqy
"Have watched his teams play or did you just read what other people are saying on Twitter that also haven‚Äôt watched his teams play?

He also said in those Fab quotes he‚Äôd like to take on a project that will last for years. Which exactly what we want and need. so it won‚Äôt be a ‚ÄúWin now‚Äù situation like it was with Mou and Conte.",Spurs,Yes,jevu788,t1_jevtjqy
Reeks of trying to copy Arsenal with another btech Pep,Spurs,Yes,jexhit0,t1_jexfvxo
At the very least he can bring a winning mentality to all the bottlers in our club,Spurs,Yes,jexha7e,t1_jexfvxo
I thought the same. It wasn't even top corner yet he just doesn't dive. Forster made a great save from a similar long range shot against Wolves iirc.,Spurs,Yes,jew4q82,t1_jew3n0t

He spends more time in the centre circle than near the opponents box. Absolute joke,Spurs,Yes,jex6spc,t1_jex5tuh
Totally agree: how to fire your manager and yet avoid benefiting from the new manager bounce. After scoring we were abysmal. And there were so many mistakes again at the back that against a better side we‚Äôd have shipped two or three. And once again we had no midfield.,Spurs,Yes,jevvi92,t1_jevu9yy

"I think the only quick players in our squad under Poch were Walker, Rose, Son and Moura.  Alli was reasonably sharp.

"> Let's be clear, some of Mason's games after Mou were atrocious.

Were they really?

We lost to Villa due to an own goal and the second half against Leeds was bad. City is city  

Other than that it wasn't anything close to atrocious. He had a midfield of Winks and Dele as number 10. Bale on his last legs, transfer listed Kane, older Toby, Aurier, and Lo Celso who couldn't find a pass if his life depended on it. A much worse squad 

Mason did fine, better than Stellini",Spurs,Yes,jewa90z,t1_jew94bk
"The only really bad game by Mason was the cup final, which was on day 6 of his first experience managing a professional football team, and he only lost 1-0.  I don't believe in being lucky - in anything except football.

Contellini turned him into a defensive midfielder. We're really not getting him back so might as well sell him to whichever club needs a left winger. Though at this point just sell anyone above 25+ and rebuild.,Spurs,Yes,jew8p4j,t1_jew55wt

It's just a guess.,Spurs,Yes,jew59rr,t1_jew55wt
">Do people genuinely believe Stellini told them to sit back 0-1 up?

Nope.

But for 18 months they've been:

a) Instructed to sit back to soak up pressure. Our main game plan is to lure them deep into our half, before counter attacking. 

b) gradually losing confidence.

Both of those combined mean that the players have lost confidence and instinct to press higher. 

Also, Stellini has been Conte's assistant for some time - I wouldn't find it surprising if he shared a lot of Conte's tactical approach to the game.",Spurs,Yes,jew8h22,t1_jew77zf
"No, but when you're 1-0 up against 10 men, that's probably the time to throw on another attacker or midfielder to keep dominating in their half instead of ""Hm, we'll wait til 85 for the big Moura sub""",Spurs,Yes,jew7tqa,t1_jew77zf

"This makes no sense. This is our biggest flaw as a fanbase, we always blame and go all in on the manager when things go bad. It‚Äôs Levy and ENIC you should be directing your discontent towards.

"From a footballing perspective, depending on circumstances, I'd be willing to give him a fair amount of leeway if he weren't successful there. Chelsea has become almost a uniquely challenging job. Similarly, I'm not not sure it reflects too badly on Potter, all things considered.

Emotionally though, if he went to chelsea, I wouldn't want him anymore.",Spurs,Yes,jew6sa0,t1_jew3olq
I'd still take him back. At least Pochettino has shown us he is capable of making the champions league with our team before. What has Potter shown?,Spurs,Yes,jewtv3k,t1_jew3olq
"Now I'm very much for doom and gloom right now, it's my right as a Tottenham fan to revel in this mud and misery.

"Yes no rebuild, we have just replaced most of the squad.

Isn't that a rebuild?  Not saying we have finished it yet but you seem to be suggesting we should have replaced the whole squad in a couple of years including a pandemic.

"Kane and Son are two of the best players this club has ever had.  In the conversation with Blanchflower, Greaves, Hoddle, Gascoigne, Modric and Bale imo.

That said, they are entering their 30s and they are forwards.  We aren't going to win anything with them in the team, and building a team around them makes little sense.

As painful as it will be, delaying their departure will only make the situation even more difficult in a couple of year.  Especially true with Son, who is very reliant on pace and who could probably still play at a very high level for a number of years in a less demanding league with better weather and remain a huge commercial draw.

The rational thing to do is to sell them now, get a chunk of money and cross your fingers and toes that we don't jizz it up the wall (like usual).",Spurs,Yes,jewe1ji,t1_jewd1fg

Prioritising top 4 over cups even when we have a good shout at winning them. And now, refusing to fire Paratici earlier which will result in us probably starting the transfer window without a DoF employed. 

His biggest fuck up happened before sacking Poch though, and that is not backing him for 2 windows in a row which probably contributed to Poch's burnout and desire to leave.",Spurs,Yes,jewivem,t1_jewgdzg

"Poch would be a step backwards. It's pure nostalgia. It's like being in a shitty relationship and wishing you had your last GF but you're purposely ignoring all the shitty stuff they did because you want to remember it as great. 

He had the best Tottenham team in decades, a prime Son, Erikson, Kane, Toby, Jan, Walker, Trippier, Moussa/Wanyama etc and he won exactly nothing. The one year he had a chance to win a title with City and Pool just starting to click with Pep and Klopp whilst Arsenal and Chelsea were mediocre and he lost it to fucking Leicester City. 

Since Poch left what's he actually done? Won French league with the Globetrotter PSG team. Why he's being considered for Real is beyond me",Spurs,Yes,jew2dae,t1_jew0px9
"Ok lots of differences. 1) Burnley are playing better more dominant football than Wolves did. 2) Burnley have a much worse squad and haven't been gifted talents like the captain of a CL team through dodgy Mendes deals. 3) Kompany is near the beginning of his career while Nuno was already an established known quantity. 4) Kompany's philosophy lines up with what lots of fans want, Nuno's philosophy is the opposite of that",Spurs,Yes,jex2dd4,t1_jewxmuu

"I believe the consensus is the way we play it is bad. 

3-4-3 doesn't necessarily mean a block of 7 in your own half with no outlet to the attacking 3",Spurs,Yes,jew70qx,t1_jew66vi
"A formation doesn‚Äôt dictate how you play. We‚Äôre not bad because of the formation, we‚Äôre bad because players are playing in roles that don‚Äôt suit them. Like son is basically playing in a midfield three, just drop him and start an actual midfielder if that‚Äôs what we want to do.",Spurs,Yes,jew7bj8,t1_jew66vi
"You have to look more at how Nagelsmann has played.

1) He's played with a back 4 a lot. The first half of this season was mostly back 4.

2) When he's played with a back 3 at his clubs, he's at times played with a wingback system, and at times with inverted fullbacks.

&#x200B;

Also, playing with wingbacks and a 3-4-3 isn't the problem in itself. The problem is mainly whether you're happy to sit back and soak up pressure - or if you want your team to be the attacking one, dominating possession and matches. 

Conte wants the former, he focuses on the defensive, and wants quick counter attacks.

">The problem Spurs have is that **football.london understands** initial contact with De Zerbi's camp has produced little in the way of positive indications that the Italian is desperate to swap his stable project at Brighton for the current chaos of the north London outfit right now.

Seems pretty clear to me",Spurs,Yes,jexu17c,t1_jexsk5t
"Football isn't just tactics. The mental part of the game is arguably more important. Listen to Ryan Mason on the high-performance podcast. He talks about when Pochettino gave him his first start in the prem and how he wanted to live up to the expectation and standard set by Poch for believing in him. It's a fascinating insight into what motivates players. 

So yeah, I am talking about desire. If Sean Dyche's team can look more organized and effective than us in a 4-4-2 then it's simply about desire and wanting it more. 

Appreciate your response though, shitting on my comment without adding any insight of your own. 

What's your galaxy brain take on yesterday's game?",Spurs,Yes,jex0yk6,t1_jex06qb

"If we really had that cut throat, top club mentality, son wouldn‚Äôt be starting every game. Dier would not be seeing the pitch again, threat of possible midfielder rotation would push POH and Skipp to try and be at their best 24/7.

">playing with wingbacks and a 3-4-3 isn't the problem in itself. 

It is *a* problem, though. Especially for players who have been drilled on its supposed solid defensive merits. The moment the opposition get the ball we retreat into a very deep 5-4-1. It will be very hard to shake the players out of this mentality without changing the system.",Spurs,Yes,jewln62,t1_jew7pct
"The thing is for Arsenal, 4-3-3 is how it starts at kickoff. In attack it morphs to 2-3-5 or 2-2-6 with the full backs tucking in. This is the modern game. Even Tuchel understands this and his Bayern team against Dortmund played this way over the weekend. He's an old dog who has learnt new tricks. Doubt Stellini aka Conte Jr can do that though esp in a matter of days.

But the biggest hurdle towards playing this system is not the coach but having the right profile of players - center backs and a GK who are really comfortable on the ball and can play out of a press, a press-resistant physical #6 who can switch plays through accurate long passes and quick short progressive passes, technically gifted fullbacks who can overlap but also invert and tuck in into the midfield like Zinchenko. Tuchel already has these profile of players at Bayern who were used to playing this way. So he could learn the new system and implement it from the get-go. That is not the case at Spurs.

These problems in personnel have to be addressed over a few transfer windows under the guidance of a motivated long-term manager who has the backing of the board. Right now, the only box that Spurs check in the listed profiles is fullbacks who can overlap. The main problem of the defence panicking every time they receive a pass in their own half against a press remains.",Spurs,Yes,jewwfgm,t1_jewsbzv

Now call me Poirot, but I don't believe for a second that the chairman of the club steadfastly refused to sign any players at all for several windows.  The rumours at the time were all that Poch had a list and he didn't want anybody who didn't fit the precise profile.  At the time we had probably the best XI in the league but not that much financial clout so was hard to find improvements.

If you and others prefer to believe that the club just totally refused to sign any players then you go with that.  Seems a bit weird though considering.",Spurs,Yes,jewtrlz,t1_jewpga6

"It's taken awhile to write this because I wanted to choose my words carefully. My theory is, that a lot of Tottenham fans speak with the arrogance of a big club, without having the relevant/modern success of a big club. At least, that is the experience online. Can't speak to the offline crowd because I don't live in England.

As I see it, the vast majority of big 6 fans are spoiled and entitled (to varying degrees), including and especially Arsenal fans. And while we all hate each other, there is a genuine respect towards one another given what the other clubs have achieved. Until Tottenham win a big trophy (PL, UCL) or a slew of the smaller trophies (LC, FA Cup, UEL), we're going to treat Spurs like the kid brother who gets picked on.

As for the smaller clubs, they likely see a sense of irony that fans of Tottenham Hotspur (who are an objectively bigger club) talk down to them when their ""successful period"" has been short, recent, and hasn't yielded any major trophies. It's like, ""where does this sense of entitlement come from?""

Now, this all might be sound flippant of me, but I really do think it's that simple. And there's probably a lot more nuance to this, but l wanted to avoid making this a dissertation.

For what it's worth, I am hoping that ya'll can finish above MUFC and NUFC. And while I certainly took pleasure in your struggles earlier in the season, that hasn't been the case for me since our derby.

It's weird for me because I've genuinely hated Tottenham for the last 6 years, but now that we're playing well I'm less bothered. I also have no love for the oil/oligarch money clubs, and while I think Levy knows fuck all about the football side of things, I recognize that he (with that help of Poch, Kane and Son) have genuinely pushed Tottenham into big club status.

Yep he's good for a highlight pass occasionally but in terms of the little things like cutting through a press and knitting things together he's out of his depth. Also very average defensively despite the whole viking leader point and shout thing he's got going on,Spurs,Yes,jex2rbv,t1_jex24d0
"PEH is a very solid ball winner and good at recycling possession and keeping things simple at the base of a more creative midfield, while sprinkling in a good long ball/through pass.

"I am not saying Nagelsmann will be a sure hit for Spurs - my point was just that he's not a 3-4-3-rigid manager (on the contrary, a criticism can be that he changes too much from 4 to 3 at the back etc), or that the 3-4-3 has to be boring.

We have no idea if we're getting the laptop-version of tactics-tinkering Nagelsmann with things being frustrating, or the young, eager attacking Nagelsmann who we saw with Hoffenheim. 

At Hoffenheim, he pressed high, and when won the ball it was direct (contrary to AVB). 

At Bayern it looked good for the first half this season, and also in the CL this winter. But in the league, they players have looked like they've lost belief.",Spurs,Yes,jewb153,t1_jew8foh

We have lots of players playing well below their potential.  Similar to when Jol took over, when Redknapp took over and when Poch took over.  The reality is it will be some recruitment and much more getting the best from the existing squad.

Spurs v. Brighton

Tottenham Hotspur Stadium

Son goes down injured in midfield in the 27th minute after a studs-up tackle at knee height for which no card is given. r/soccer calls him a diving cheat. As the medical team carry the South Korean off the pitch. Danjuma stands up off the bench and begins stretching. This is it. This is his chance.

But wait, what's that above the stadium? Everyone looks up, captivated by the sight of a propellor plane, trailed by a banner. They are able to decipher the words ""FUCK OFF CLUB SIGNING."" In the cockpit, none other than Antonio Conte. From the other seat, a figure leaps out and parachutes onto the pitch. 

Upon landing, the figure is seen to be a Brazilian man, somewhere in his 30s, in full playing kit, including a 2013-14 Spurs shirt. The name on the back:

DAMI√ÉO",Spurs,No,jeudix3,t3_12aa22p
Brendan Rodgers seems to have the lowest odds to become our manager right now. Checks out across multiple betting sites. I'd fucking hate that so much.,Spurs,No,jercvfv,t3_12aa22p
"Actually think that's it for me lads. We were so bad today, and even after we got the undeserved lead, I still felt we'd end up losing. Blame the tactics but also the players at this point. Cant be arsed with selfish cunts such as Lucas and Romero. Think certain players such as Son have been in terrible form and need to also take some of the blame. Not to mention how big of a fail Levy is. In all likelihood, I will probs come here tomorrow and just see most of the peoole here still dick riding that parasite. Also there is the loser mentality of people here begging to bring back Winks or hire Potter. Just too draining.

Feels we will lose Kane (feels almost certain at this point) this year. No UCL football next year in all likelihood as well as, and given Levy remains and willl probs fuck up the manager and DOF, not much going in terms of a rebuild. It is gonna sound a bummer but even if we do get it right, I just dont see anything changing. Nothing has in years and we are a bottling side, again despite all the player in the sub who want to build a templw for our top 4 finishes and think trophies are too far from us. Hated conte but most of what he said is accurate.

Know I am gonna get being downvoted for being negativebut I dont care anymore. I cant even get excited about a single player we have for the future. Something to be said about recruitment or how we ruin them. The cricket prem league just began so I am gonna be watching that. Hope I dont feel the need to come back but alas.

"Hope the match against Everton made some people realise that this team isn't equipped to play De Zerbi ball anymore than it is Enrique, Nagelsmann, Ange ball.

De Zerbi's building out from the back relies a lot on very very very risky passes and movements to draw pressure and create space. The current profiles of players we have in defense and midfield just aren't built to do that.

Any manager we get in this summer is going to need a big rebuild, and if they are backed properly, we might even see some fan favourites leave as I don't know if they can handle the switch from a transition-based team to a possession-based team.",Spurs,No,jev7f1w,t3_12aa22p
Can't believe I'm saying this but we need a player like Winks to control games like these instead of playing hope ball and cowardly sitting back praying,Spurs,No,jeu94a0,t3_12aa22p

Get a forward thinking manager in and the first thing they're doing is booting Hojbjerg out the club. I can't wait.,Spurs,No,jeu2u3l,t3_12aa22p
"Why the hell would anyone want Kompany based on one season in the Championship, at such a crucial period for the club? He could become a top manager in the future, but he lost 6-0 to Man City this season so he clearly needs more experience against top level opposition. Banking on success in the Championship as a standard is how you end up with players like Rodon.",Spurs,No,jesg8bv,t3_12aa22p
"Ok so let‚Äôs figure this out.  The game is on the line. You are under attack to a team playing with 10 men and up 1 goal.  How do you handle it?  If you are Spurs you take off Lenglet and bring on Sanchez hoping he will score the equalizer for Everton.  That doesn‚Äôt work so your next sub is Lucas. Certainly he can give you an outlet to the pressure right?  Not a chance he gets a red card 30 seconds after coming on.  You cannot make this shit up.  A logical person would conclude we have to be trying to lose.  How can it be any other way?  Honestly what did Danjuma do?  The guy lucked into a goal in the only time I‚Äôve seen him play.  That is how messed up Spurs are.  We get rid of Doherty to make room for Porro (I do like Porro) but we keep Sanchez?  Why?  The next manager needs to play whoever is playing well despite their age.  They also need to sit people who can‚Äôt play or hit a bad spell down.  Fit the damn system to your personnel on the pitch.  Conte‚Äôs tactics suck and so does his inflexibility but the starting XI or 15 trusted players are also shit too.  Most of them have the mental toughness of Steve Irkle.  If it was me and I was the DOF (which we don‚Äôt have) I would allow Kane to leave he doesn‚Äôt deserve this anymore and we can use the money.  Id keep Romero, Langlet, Porro, Spence, PM Sarr, Bentencuar, Deki, Bissouma, Gil, Richarlison, Danjuma, Royal, Sessegnon, Foster as a backup Keeper, and a few young players on loan.  

I would AXE ü™ì

"He is magic, you knowww.",Spurs,No,jeso0c2,t3_12aa22p
Most likely Chelsea would snatch Nags. The most likely candidate who could convince Kane to sign a new contract is Poch. If Kane is gone we will be a mid table team for 3-4 years until some long term coach builds us back again,Spurs,No,jerc0f2,t3_12aa22p
Harry. Get the fuck out of this club before you end your career. You deserve so much better.,Spurs,No,jeu270w,t3_12aa22p
"if Tottenham fans just shut their mouths for once in their pathetic existences then maybe Conte stays he carries on building and we aren't in the managerial mess we're in now. How about that?

Just think if we beat Everton tonight we go third in the league and many outsiders will think why on Earth did they get rid of Conte when he's doing the best with what he's got so far.",Spurs,No,jes3q4h,t3_12aa22p

2. Always better is for wingers to do the winging rather than wingbacks as quality of out & out wingers will always be higher than wingbacks.",Spurs,No,jesx4b2,t3_12aa22p

"Funny enough finishing Top 4 is probably not that unlikely given our main competitors are also floundering around currently. That being said, Top 4 isn't enough for how dissapointing this season has been. It really has been the same cycle for the past 5 years.

Kane probably leaves at the end of the season to UTD or Chelsea. Maybe Bayern depending on how certain he wants to be of winning a trophy.

As for lloris and Son they should just go to their home countries and finish their career with some dignity. Especially for Son because its looking increasingly likely he's going to end up on the ""best players who never won a trophy"" list. Son could probably crack it at bayern or barca. Heard Barca were interested but they're broke ü§£ü§£ü§£

"Maybe but I think people have been going overboard with this distinction between fullbacks and wingbacks. In this day and age you need attacking output from your fullbacks, look at the Liverpool pair or before that the likes of Dani Alves and Marcelo who all played in a back 4.

"All of this.

Compare how Brighton moved from Potter to de Zerbi, or Swansea‚Äôs successful run maybe 10 years ago where the club was set up well to transition from coach to coach.

(Chelsea, oddly, have been largely effective in spite of manager turnover, but of course have vastly greater resources.)

As a club we‚Äôve been successful to a point, but it feels like Levy erred in ceding control to Paratici given his apparent preference for defensive coaches.

Regardless of how *accurate* it may be, we as a club have a perception of entertainment being a priority and acceptable replacement for tangible success. Levy acknowledged it with his DNA comment, but then went against that with Paratici and Conte.

I suppose the good news is that the pendulum now surely has to swing in favour of an attack-minded coach, but as you say, the club needs to be set up for that - the right coach, the right backroom, the right players, and that ethos instilled in the club from the academy on upwards.",Spurs,Yes,jet3k06,t1_jese8kf

"I am totally with you.  In fact I feel like we would be lucky to get him at the moment.

We desperately need some stability and some time to develop the team, everything has got very frantic.  He should come in for a 4-5 year stint with a particular blueprint and as a club we need to see it through.  At the end of that time we would likely have no players left from his first stint here and the squad would be completely rebuilt.  Whether we are the same level remains to be seen but we need the commit to the process.",Spurs,Yes,jerxbuk,t1_jerwsm0
"We need Poch to work with a DoF that he's happy to work with. I'm still not sure if I can be emotionally prepared for Poch potentially failing with us, but if we get a solid DoF he's happy to work with I think it can work.",Spurs,Yes,jerxp3m,t1_jerwsm0

"The positive side would be that it would be harder for Feyenoord to demand a higher fee due to their financial constraints. Ajax could demand a high fee as their regular CL football gives them financial power over the rest of the league and they aren‚Äôt as desperate for cash flow. Compare the transfers of Anthony and Gakpo for example.

"My worries with Poch are fourfold:

1. Would he still have the hunger that made him so succesful the first time around after managing giants like PSG and being a serious candidate for Madrid?

2. The game has evolved a bit in the last 3-4 and some of his tactics might be a bit outdated (as pointed out by Nathan from the Extra Inch). Would he still play the same or would he have evolved?

3. Would he have the patience for our transfer policies this time around?

"Yes, he's orders of magnitude better than anyone else on the market. If Liverpool don't get CL football, I think they'll part ways at the end the season. I think he'd take a break but I can see him managing a non-Everton/Man Utd/Man City team in the richest, most competitive league.",Spurs,Yes,jerx2hw,t1_jerw0xk
"All managerial appointments are risky moves. We just employed two ""serial winners"" and played dogshit football for three years. There's no such thing as a ""sure thing"" in football anymore, if there ever really was one.",Spurs,Yes,jes4g3h,t1_jes315m
"I‚Äôm convinced half the people here don‚Äôt even watch our games, never mind Feyenoord lmao",Spurs,Yes,jes5l31,t1_jes315m
"From what I've read / heard, he basically is really good at getting the ball to the final third and then he just relies on wingers to beat a man or cross the ball. That's a pass for me.",Spurs,Yes,jes3i2e,t1_jes315m

"There are definitely Slot in people even before the hype. 

I definitely would prefer Slot over Rodgers or Potter though. 

You might be true about the bandwagoners but ever since I started watching Feyenoord more carefully since we were linked with him, I have been super impressed with their football and Slot himself. He is top of the league with Feyenoord.

He also absolutely dominated Shakhtar Donetsk who arguably have a better team in the Europa League. He has done some amazing things. If we can't get other targets such as De Zerbi, we HAVE to go after Arne Slot. He has been great at 2 Eredivisie clubs now.

What he has done could be argued is more impressive than what Ten Hag has done.

Ask Feyenoord fans.",Spurs,Yes,jes5h6v,t1_jes315m
"A man that plays nice football, has transformed his feyenord side after losing several of their best players and currently ending Ajax dominance in the eredivisie, also in contention to reach a UEL final or maybe even win it, somewhat of a project guy and got several awards over ten hag",Spurs,Yes,jes7mjb,t1_jes315m
"I have. I like watching Eredivisie so Ive seen a lot of his games. I dont know if hes an ETH though, because the resources they have are completely different in level.",Spurs,Yes,jescml6,t1_jes315m

"He's 100% going to PSG in the summer. 

They were linked in January for him to replace Messi",Spurs,Yes,jerhwef,t1_jerhlx5
"Le Fee would be amazing for our midfield. Since we are going to hopefully transition to a more possession style, he will be vital for that style",Spurs,Yes,jeric6k,t1_jerhlx5
Should‚Äôve gone for him before he signed the contract. Would‚Äôve even qualified as HG in 3 years then,Spurs,Yes,jerj2o9,t1_jerhlx5
Based on 2/3 of a season at Burnley?,Spurs,Yes,jese94b,t1_jesd38r

I would take him and get behind him.  It would be bold but it is a clear direction and would show intent from our club.,Spurs,Yes,jesey1m,t1_jesd38r
"Kane has like 10 goals vs Dyche sides, he loves a match against them",Spurs,Yes,jesuv7g,t1_jestdoe
Yep. 100%. We should have lost by 2 so we were lucky. Fucking hell I‚Äôm livid.,Spurs,Yes,jeu2qb7,t1_jeu1c6w

"If the club had an ounce of competence, they would hire an attacking manager, sell Kane for 90-100m to United and just rebuild.",Spurs,Yes,jeu3kf7,t1_jeu37sa
Poch with this group of players will just tarnish his legacy and wouldn't last 2 years. I'd rather he stay away for now.,Spurs,Yes,jeu5eif,t1_jeu4s9v
"I wouldn't wish this on Poch, I love him",Spurs,Yes,jeu58v0,t1_jeu4s9v
"All I can think about when people mention Poch is how dreadful the football was when it ended.

I just don't know if he's grown or evolved or anything.",Spurs,Yes,jeu5b3d,t1_jeu4s9v
Still got 3+ months of it too.,Spurs,Yes,jeron8i,t1_jerobeo
They have very good wingbacks and midfield. Perfect for his system,Spurs,Yes,jerg82h,t1_jerfxn5
Could see Conte going to PSG. Endless money pool for him to create a squad.,Spurs,Yes,jerg2er,t1_jerfxn5
"Had same thought, they're gonna be ruthless ffs",Spurs,Yes,jerqqt8,t1_jerfxn5
He left Chelsea on pretty bad terms though,Spurs,Yes,jergbzw,t1_jerfxn5
Why would Vivell ever pick Conte,Spurs,Yes,jeriec2,t1_jerfxn5
"I'd love it if he joined Chelsea.

Would be another short-term manager for them when what they need is a long-term one, he'd make sure there's constant negativity around the club, he'd make them splash a lot of money on Conte-tactics, and would then leave 18 months later with a club in turmoil. 

And he wouldn't win them a trophy in that period, I'd put money on it.   
He's dreadful in Europe (regardless of clubs), and in England, for the clubs and wealth he's had, his cup record isn't impressive, and don't think he'd beat the current top clubs in England.",Spurs,Yes,jerlvsp,t1_jerfxn5
"To help them in the league? Yea.

But their focus is gonna be the CL now, and Conte‚Äôs definitely not the right man for that given his record",Spurs,Yes,jes12oy,t1_jerfxn5
The way people talk about him like an ex is really weird honestly. Never understood that one,Spurs,Yes,jes7wbo,t1_jes60zt
"Exactly. It‚Äôs similar to how England fans don‚Äôt appreciate Kane enough. 

People talk about Arnie Slot. The first time I‚Äôve heard about him was when Conte got the sack. This sub forgot the fact that Ajax got raided by United for their coach and their best players. We even sent our boy stevie to damage them further. What did you expect feynoord (again first time hearing about them) to do ??

Take Angie Postman‚Ä¶ he coaches Celtic. I believe Steven gerrard was also coaching in the same league as him. Look how he worked out at Aston Villa.

Clearly Nags would prefer Real or Chelsea or PSG to us. Poch is the only one who‚Äôd respect and love our club enough to give it his all.",Spurs,Yes,jesa5n8,t1_jes60zt
Potter a bit of a cautionary tale,Spurs,Yes,jerxegb,t1_jerp4gg
"unfortunately for ENIC and Levy, Top 4 is more valuable than a trophy apparently....",Spurs,Yes,jeubvwt,t1_jeubler
Pep ball. Highest scoring team in the championship,Spurs,Yes,jesof87,t1_jesna8a
"Same as what Pep is doing at City. Inverted full backs for midfield dominance, heavy possession, chain breaking wingers, combination plays, pass & move, triangles, patterns.",Spurs,Yes,jesovli,t1_jesna8a
imagine us getting a scrappy win with a terrible performance and go third and yet the sub will do a collective shrug lol,Spurs,Yes,jetfyym,t1_jeteidw
the worst part is what if he joins Chelsea.....,Spurs,Yes,jeu62d7,t1_jeu59xh
His football is ridiculously attractive.,Spurs,Yes,jes191y,t1_jerxo4q
"He didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfaff‚Äù about here, he coached the national under 17 and under 20 squads for 7 years. Then got more experience overseas, came back, led Brisbane to back to back premierships, moved on for a challenge, coached the national men‚Äôs side for 4 years then went and won J league.",Spurs,Yes,jes30ts,t1_jerxo4q
"99% of them have never watched Celtic, they are just bandwagoners.",Spurs,Yes,jerybrx,t1_jerxo4q
Celtic play good football,Spurs,Yes,jerzaze,t1_jerxo4q
"Amazing football, can scout the J and K leagues like no other. Doing a great job at Celtic while playing good football. Much better option than Rodgers or Potter for us. 

I do prefer Arne Slot though.",Spurs,Yes,jes2m8d,t1_jerxo4q
"Seems like he‚Äôs done a good job at Celtic, they looked like they were in crisis mode when he arrived.",Spurs,Yes,jes9ra0,t1_jerxo4q
I could see him playing a dele like role second striker role with Richy ahead.,Spurs,Yes,jet1vyt,t1_jeszlj8
"100% correct and it is a big big downside.

1. Son-Kane-Kulu just can't press due to age and speed.
2. He will need young hungry players who need to completely trust 
    his tactics and style.
3. PL has moved forward and teams are more press-resistant top to 
    bottom. Even Championship teams too.",Spurs,Yes,jet2w9f,t1_jeszlj8
How much does de bruyne press (in relation to Kane) and would Kane ever fall into that kind of role?,Spurs,Yes,jet3ze6,t1_jeszlj8
"The average life expectancy for a PL coach is about 1.6 seasons or something.

We haven't had a coach finish the season since Poch in 2018.

In over two decades of ENIC, we have only ever had one manager survive long enough to extend their initial contract, again Poch.

So yeah, being a PL manager is not a particularly long lived position.",Spurs,Yes,jerc47p,t1_jer7mim
I wouldn't bet on it. I'm already expecting to see Nagelsmann signing a 8 year contract and shaking Boehly's hand in a few days.,Spurs,Yes,jerxl2t,t1_jerx4cw
"Maybe... I don't know. At the end of the day we only have one manager job available for our club. That was the case before and after Chelsea doing Chelsea things. It was the case before and after nagelsmann being available. And just like now, it doesn't change the fact that they were multiple ostensibly capable managers available for either of our clubs.

In some ways, yes, it probably forces moves to be made, or at least narrows are options down. I'm not sure about the reverse psychology component of someone being let down because they wanted Chelsea, but sure who knows.

I'm far less worried about what Chelsea does on the manager market than I am about getting a fucking vision out of Daniel Levy. There has and never will be a single manager for a single club. In some way, most assets are fungible, and clubs should have plans. They're not dependent upon single individuals. They're dependent upon cohesive visions and signings, DOFs, and managers that all work together towards that vision. We could hire or fire whomever we want, but it needs to work towards an overarching goal. Since there's absolutely no semblance of it publicly, I'm holding out hope that levy has something privately in mind that he's trying to accomplish. But losing faith in that annually at this point, honestly...",Spurs,Yes,jery2vc,t1_jerx4cw
Why is Chelsea more desperate than us? We actually are fighting for CL football (and the money) and aren't acting desperately. Chelsea are just playing out the season.,Spurs,Yes,jerxqyr,t1_jerx4cw
It‚Äôs really weird that all the matches aren‚Äôt on peacock.,Spurs,Yes,jesidmb,t1_jes5t1z

'This thing is true is it weren't for this other thing that discounts it',Spurs,Yes,jerdix8,t1_jer6uf0
I mean that has to factor into things. Don't want Chelsea's sloppy seconds,Spurs,Yes,jeraybd,t1_jer6uf0
"Agreed. Imagine Enrique ball with Dier, Hugo, Hojbjerg, Sanchez, Perisic, Tanganga, and Lucas Moura. We'd win the treble man!",Spurs,Yes,jeuax5w,t1_jeuajgv
Hear Judas is on the market..,Spurs,Yes,jerq4q3,t1_jeroxim

"Should have subbed Danjuma in instead of Lucas and let Lenglet finish the game. Yes he was on a yellow but it was no riskier than playing fucking Davinson on the left hand side, when he struggles on the ball even on the right.",Spurs,Yes,jeu6jdk,t1_jeu5n35
Danjuma exists,Spurs,Yes,jeu86pa,t1_jeu5n35
"play Danjuma...

 he can't even do that right...",Spurs,Yes,jeu5w1i,t1_jeu5n35

"What? And skip all the crazy summer shit, come on now",Spurs,Yes,jeu94vp,t1_jeu8ggr
"> There is definitely potential in this squad

I just don't see it. Defence in particular needs almost a complete overhaul, we're not about go to onto a 4th manager fooling ourselves that Dier and Davies are good enough, surely? 

Also huge question marks over Kane and how we replace his 20+ goals every season and general depth in attack is horrendous. 

There is potential for this squad to be good with the right players added, but potential for this squad right now I don't think so.",Spurs,Yes,jessce6,t1_jesr4ez
Conte was sacked a week ago! It's been 7 days,Spurs,Yes,jerlyoy,t1_jerk79z
On the same plane of existence as Soccer AM and Copa 90,Spurs,Yes,jet2tf9,t1_jet1xrt

"From me:

""I know in training they played a back 8 with two goalkeepers but I'm expecting them only to play with one keeper tonight. He has two ears and two eyes on his head though.""

""They tried 4-4-4 but quickly realised that was against the rules""

There, now brainlessly bandy my baseless nonsense about the internet to grow my brand for me, thanks",Spurs,Yes,jethu5h,t1_jetgsak
Why? You think next manager won't solve all of our issues?,Spurs,Yes,jeubbv3,t1_jeuawk2
What misstake was this? The one where Poch literally said it was mutual and HAD to happen because he was in such a bad state? Nobody not even Poch has ever claimed firing him was a misstake.,Spurs,Yes,jes16qu,t1_jes0px8
He has reminded me of someone for a while now. I think you figured out who.,Spurs,Yes,jet8lax,t1_jet83ck
Kind of a stretch but it's the shape of their ears that are similar.,Spurs,Yes,jet9i8f,t1_jet83ck

I feel like Brendan Rodgers is one of the best managers for the richest of the poor clubs and fans thinking that we're the poorest of the rich clubs instead means we're too fancy for him which ... seems a little bit fanciful to me,Spurs,Yes,jesaneo,t1_jes98wz
I mean he also wasted a year of his own career with his injuries and totally shit performances?,Spurs,Yes,jerxg0w,t1_jeruw5s
"Agreed big time. I feel like the delay in decision will end up in a Nuno type candidate. Need someone who is excited to be here and work with the team. It sends a bad message to those out of work like Poch if we don't move now, and opens us up for failure if we delay too long",Spurs,Yes,jerq9d7,t1_jerp9g7
Well I love your username,Spurs,Yes,jeumvux,t1_jeuklvg
I am absolutely gobsmacked that he didn't get playtime today after Stellini's comments. Danjuma will continue to be my protest beacon against this shite,Spurs,Yes,jeunxia,t1_jeuklvg
Danjuma would have done similarly nothing. Needed one of the forwards off for a midfielder instead of like for like,Spurs,Yes,jev59iv,t1_jeuklvg
i can‚Äôt believe this is how wrestlemania was spoiled for me,Spurs,Yes,jerewrs,t1_jer88gm
"I've not watched wrestling for about 15-20 years, but Roman looks like a greasy jobber rather than a WWE champion.",Spurs,Yes,jer9ih9,t1_jer88gm
I stopped watched WWE years and years ago cos I got sick of the Roman/Brock monopoly and everytime I look back at the product it's somehow still going,Spurs,Yes,jeriuqe,t1_jer88gm
"If Roman was going to win then just let him win. Why did it need ANOTHER interference. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs fucking bullshit. 

I‚Äôm also sick of that as a whole thing in WWE. Main event title matches at wrestlemania should never end due to bullshit. It‚Äôs lazy creative.",Spurs,Yes,jerp1km,t1_jer88gm
"Somethings been off with our recruitment for years and it‚Äôs not a binary issue. Levy is part of the problem but not all of it.

Two windows without a signing is a huge part of the problem. Delaying and haggling and missing out on targets is another (look at the two Napoli players who‚Äôs names begin with K who are tearing it up right now, or Grealish for example). The chaotic management merry-go-round is also in Levy‚Äôs wheel-house, we‚Äôve needed a rebuild manager since Poch left and we brought in two ‚Äòwin-now‚Äô chaos engines (and Nuno). Paratici is on Levy and whilst he‚Äôs made some good moves and seems to be sorting scouting and academy talent, he probably in hindsight should not have been hired. By all accounts some of the worst Manager names came from him.

Yes each individual Manager has made poor decisions and failed to live up to expectations, but they‚Äôve also been hamstrung by the transfer tactics Levy employs.

Honestly with a modern Coach, who has progressive ideas and a focus on improving players, developing youth and is tactically flexible, should be able to get the best from Kane, Son, Deki, Richy, Bissouma, Bentancur, Skipp, PEH, Porro, Udogie, Romero, Sarr, Gil and Spence. That‚Äôs 14 players to form the foundation of a great squad. We need two CB‚Äôs, a GK and an AM to take that to 17 players. Add Davies, Sess and Dier as back up bench options and maybe start blooding the Academy talent and we are well on the way.",Spurs,Yes,jercs7y,t1_jerbepn
Yeah because when you're a club our size in terms of financial strength. You can't shy away from mistakes. You gotta go again.,Spurs,Yes,jerckq1,t1_jerbepn

"You forgot 

5. Former Chelsea manager",Spurs,Yes,jeshqe7,t1_jeshczy
"Going after Potter *now* really just shows how there is no plan at all behind the scenes. It's one thing when there aren't good quality managers out there, but as I've been saying a lot the past few days: We're linked to a lot of good names this time.

Moreover: I want a manager who *wants* to be here. Potter clearly wanted something bigger than Spurs -- the way Nagelsmann wants something bigger now--, got it, and got badly exposed. These kind of managers have yet to work for Spurs, and I don't see that changing with Potter.",Spurs,Yes,jesmxeb,t1_jeshczy
"With de zerbi doing what he's doing at Brighton, maybe I'm an idiot but I worry  that Brighton is set up in such a way that it flatters the coach to some extent. Did potter look better than he actually was bc of how Brighton recruits and is set up organizationally?",Spurs,Yes,jeslyzh,t1_jeshczy
"Use ur brain before commenting, please",Spurs,Yes,jet1y8d,t1_jeshczy

"Forgot the

Similar to the Son issue this season. We don‚Äôt have midfielders capable of playing in a 2 (maybe Bentancur but he had some stinkers). Continuing to play decent players in a system that doesn‚Äôt work for them will wreck their confidence and being run into the ground doesn‚Äôt help (also never being benched) I‚Äôm not absolving the players at all but this is a source of it.,Spurs,Yes,jeu6t09,t1_jeu54qr
We also need to sign Gedson permanently and not on a loan this time to show our commitment to him.,Spurs,Yes,jeu89ti,t1_jeu7sg9

"When Son is still drawing blanks in a system that favours him next season is it still going to be Conte‚Äôs thought?

Son is staying. No chance a possession oriented manager uses Son like this. He‚Äôd be lethal when he‚Äôs back to running in behind defences,Spurs,Yes,jeu9w7e,t1_jeu8j65

Levy's biggest accomplishment in recent years is making a large part of our fanbase think this is the best we can hope for, he's irreplaceable and without him we will end up like Everton. Don't feel bad about stepping away, we  owe nothing to him with the dreadful football, highest ticket prices in Europe and his lack of ambition and competence that he serves us every year. Unless you just want a break from football, I recommend following a local team if you have one.

Quite literally everyone is aware of that.,Spurs,Yes,jevbohh,t1_jev7f1w
You think our squad is worse than Brighton? If they can do it why can‚Äôt we?,Spurs,Yes,jevexng,t1_jev7f1w
No. Stop. Get some help.,Spurs,Yes,jeu9iy8,t1_jeu94a0
Fucking grim,Spurs,Yes,jeugaan,t1_jeu94a0
Good lord even the fans have the mentality of ants,Spurs,Yes,jeuc5w4,t1_jeu94a0
What in the world. This comment was as baffling as subbing on Sanchez and Moura.,Spurs,Yes,jeu9tfp,t1_jeu94a0
I'm sure the next manager will finally unlock his full potential.,Spurs,Yes,jeu9rgm,t1_jeu94a0
[deleted],Spurs,Yes,jesgjit,t1_jesg8bv
Why are you getting rid of Skipp?,Spurs,Yes,jev4dzh,t1_jeuz4pt
"It seems to me there's been lots and lots of negative press reports on any Qatari takeover. At the top of my head, I can remember Guardian, independant, the Athletic, and the Telegraph reporting on it.

I suspect we as Spurs fans tend to not notice negative reports as much when it's other clubs. Same as refereeing decisions, etc - we end up feeling like we're the biggest victims constantly.",Spurs,Yes,jerviu6,t1_jers3ur
"In terms of the reaction of media, yes. But people are quite outraged about it.",Spurs,Yes,jerwkqn,t1_jers3ur
United are a wannabe Manchester City anyways. Their fans want to spend like an oil club. Not surprised.,Spurs,Yes,jes34e8,t1_jers3ur
Probably because United getting backing like that keeps the status quo of them spending assloads anyway.,Spurs,Yes,jert50d,t1_jers3ur
"I can't see that at all.  When you've been alive long enough to see Hoddle, Gazza, Waddle, Lineker, Klinsmann, Sheringham, Ginola, Judas, Carr, Berbatov, Keane, Van der Vaart, Modric, Bale, Dembele, Eriksen and Ruel Fox leave the club you realise it is much more resilient than you think and there is always someone else.

We wouldn't have nobody up front, we would have an international striker better than most other sides in the division have.  

I'm sure we would have a dip but 4 years in mid-table seems extremely pessimistic.",Spurs,Yes,jeridzt,t1_jerc0f2
"I think we‚Äôd definitely drop to mid table for one season but then fighting for 4th the next. 3-4 years seems a bit much. 

That being said, I am assuming Levy makes the correct decisions on transfers and other things. So I don‚Äôt think Kane by itself would leave us stranded for a few years but if Levy also continues his terrible decision making then the things might stack on top of each other",Spurs,Yes,jerczl0,t1_jerc0f2
People don't want to acknowledge this. But it's so painfully true.,Spurs,Yes,jercdpn,t1_jerc0f2
He was fucking abysmal. How about he starts performing instead of moping around and losing the ball every time he touches it,Spurs,Yes,jeu34wy,t1_jeu270w
I wish we had stability under Conte as well but it's difficult when the most 'Conte out' person was Conte himself.,Spurs,Yes,jes4obt,t1_jes3q4h
Conte didn‚Äôt do any favors by talking about needing time while living in hotel room and not commiting to a contract,Spurs,Yes,jes4bc7,t1_jes3q4h
Na Conte has to go- we were playing shit under him and his tactics were pure ass,Spurs,Yes,jes4w95,t1_jes3q4h
Conte only has himself to blame. If he'd taken some accountability and kept his mouth shut he'd go into next season with a squad practically made for him,Spurs,Yes,jes5819,t1_jes3q4h
If he wanted to stay and carry on building he should‚Äôve signed a new contract but instead he just kept blowing up in press conferences,Spurs,Yes,jes4a2o,t1_jes3q4h
"Cos he disrespected the club, it's really not that difficult to wrap your head around. He was also wholly non-committal and clearly unhappy outside of Milan 

Struggle to see how us beating Everton would prove that that clown should have stuck around. Next level mental gymnastics.",Spurs,Yes,jes4bjl,t1_jes3q4h
Forgot how the fans forced Conte into a rant criticising the club that employed him,Spurs,Yes,jes4jhk,t1_jes3q4h
Conte revisionism coming in earlier than expected,Spurs,Yes,jes6xdt,t1_jes3q4h
Bruh even without CL football they‚Äôve been signing better players than us üíÄ,Spurs,Yes,jeukef5,t1_jeuj0wm
He had Coman and Davies as his WB‚Äôs so there was no problem there,Spurs,Yes,jeszt9d,t1_jesx4b2

delete this or they'll ban you,Spurs,Yes,jetp1jl,t1_jeto5p6
"Just not true. Conte switches between a 352 and 343.

Dyche is playing a 451, which is very similar to a 442.",Spurs,Yes,jetqsj2,t1_jetop5a
"They're not. 

Saelemakers especially isn't a forward he's a wingback and not amazing

Super inconsistent",Spurs,Yes,jes7dpc,t1_jes3wxl
"They are not... For these two positions, I want Szoboszlai and Bryan Gil.",Spurs,Yes,jes466x,t1_jes3wxl
"Top 4 is very unlikely. Once we lose to Brighton, Newcastle, Liverpool, United it‚Äôs over.",Spurs,Yes,jeupjyw,t1_jeujls8
You‚Äôre a stupid idiot. It‚Äôs so obvious to everyone here that the reason Son isn‚Äôt performing well is because Perisic has been playing in his position.,Spurs,Yes,jeuq5vq,t1_jeujls8
Negative number,Spurs,Yes,jes39ci,t1_jes339q
"That Bayern game was a horrible watch this weekend, oh ESPN.",Spurs,Yes,jes3etb,t1_jes339q
Go on then.,Spurs,Yes,jeripaw,t1_jerglzb
"Surely watching Spurs isn't as bad as watching basketball? Most annoying sounding sport too, just endless squeaking, nah.",Spurs,Yes,jermtkt,t1_jerglzb
"Surely watching spurs even at their worst is better than squeaky hoops where the final ‚Äú30 seconds‚Äù of a game is just fouling, relentless inbounding, and timeouts ad nauseam for 20-30 minutes.",Spurs,Yes,jeslxta,t1_jerglzb
"This is mostly true. The contract is actually a 20 year, 1.4 billion deal by the master 4D chess player Todd Donkey",Spurs,Yes,jerunpo,t1_jer4lpv
It's really quite astounding how that is.,Spurs,Yes,jeucz41,t1_jeucnyi
He'll need a few good sub appearances first I feel although I'd like him to play instead of Perisic to see something different,Spurs,Yes,jerupmr,t1_jeru63u
All the big journalists were saying he was someone Spurs/Levy liked a lot and were viewing as an option when Mourinho was sacked. There's no grudge,Spurs,Yes,jerkl9j,t1_jeriwmf
Source?,Spurs,Yes,jerj25k,t1_jeriwmf
"He‚Äôs a creative midfielder, something we don‚Äôt have. If we were to switch to a midfield 3, his competition would be GLC who probably will be sold anyways.",Spurs,Yes,jervm4n,t1_jerupmj
 He is the worst,Spurs,Yes,jeul0x0,t1_jeuez2z
Amen,Spurs,Yes,jeugmn2,t1_jeuez2z
"It's arguably trending towards playing traditional cbs as full backs with players like Ake, Stones, Burn (he used to be a cb right) and White. Obviously that's still niche and majority of teams still use traditional marauding full backs",Spurs,Yes,jesa0f4,t1_jes9et5
Yeah me too. Just a bit odd,Spurs,Yes,jes8r9e,t1_jes8607
by that logic we should bring back Reguilon (tbc I totally agree),Spurs,Yes,jesbjf5,t1_jesaf1n
"I agree with you.  Most of us are hungry for a direction.  Id much rather bring in a manager without a name but a plan rather than get a name who is just a name.  For all of Chelsea‚Äôs spending how has that worked out?  It hasn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt think potter sucks that bad, I think he was given a bunch of players basically two squads that barely know each other.  The first were picked before he got there.  That isn‚Äôt a plan.  Give me some up and comer and let him make a name here.",Spurs,No,jetl2ge,t1_jet3k06
Even if we draw we go above United. If we win we go to 3rd,Spurs,Yes,jesrahc,t1_jesqn2h
"yes but they have TWO games in hand.  They have Brentford, Everton and Forest before playing us this month.  After that they have Villa.

In the same stretch we have Everton, Brighton, Bournemouth, Newcastle and then Liverpool after.

Being above a team who has two games in hand with fairly simple fixtures doesn't feel that great to me, but then if we get points on the board I guess the pressure is on them.",Spurs,Yes,jesug2y,t1_jesqn2h
Lol,Spurs,Yes,jeub9o0,t1_jeuayl1
coventry city lol,Spurs,Yes,jesdcwf,t1_jescupa

"Didn't you hear, FFP isn't a thing so...",Spurs,Yes,jerdelo,t1_jerd6e9
"No matter when Poch is brought in there is always a risk of failure, but to dare is to do",Spurs,Yes,jerznf4,t1_jerxp3m
Benjamin Manga (from Eintracht Frankfurt) + Pochettino or even Ramon Planes + Pochettino would work out well imo.,Spurs,Yes,jes2s60,t1_jerxp3m
"Sure, you'd just imagine on match day maybe there would be some conversation about the match

Still plenty to play for too, United and Barcodes are far from impervious",Spurs,Yes,jesqpya,t1_jesqd35
"If we could win the Conference League, I want it. But Spurs are never going to win a trophy even the Conference League so why bother.",Spurs,Yes,jeu4utf,t1_jeu4egv
"I mean when Poch was with us, ManUtd, Real Madrid wanted him. He was good and he made us a respected team. I don't care about him being a legend for us, I only know that he is always open to manage us again. The only reason we won't hire him is probably only because Levy.",Spurs,Yes,jerd5e9,t1_jerckuh
"Yea, he probably feels oblige to make us succeed somehow given all of this recent rise was all thanks to him.",Spurs,Yes,jerdauq,t1_jerbqor
"If even Poch doesn't want to deal with the toxic chairman, I don't think any good manager who aren't just here for the money would want to take the job.",Spurs,Yes,jerd8bf,t1_jercid5
"Same question goes for the other top managers except that the fans wishes to have. Who would want to work with Levy at this point...? It is a big risk to take. 

Also if Poch's tactics are outdated, why would Madrid want him?",Spurs,Yes,jesj7p4,t1_jes0ppa
yep even criticizing Thomas Partey is controversial on that subreddit lol.,Spurs,Yes,jes3h5t,t1_jernaqz
"> tens of thousands of Arsenal fans have finally crawled out of the woodwork

I think it's rather Chelsea or City plastics switching to Arsenal this season. If Arsenal have a poor season next year they'll switch back.",Spurs,Yes,jes4q6o,t1_jernaqz
"Oh, absolutely. It's more the response to it that has baffled me. I've seen plenty of ""hurr durr spurs small"" jokes on there before, but the reception that one has had really highlights how that subreddit loves beating a dead horse so much even Tesco wouldn't want to use it in their lasagne.",Spurs,Yes,jermaja,t1_jerm2tn
"We took lots of time with Nuno because we were chasing numerous other targets who turned us down.  
(Another reason why I‚Äôd be weary of spurs going for De Zerbi etc - can see that turning public and Spurs looking desperate again)",Spurs,Yes,jerpinp,t1_jerm25x
"No need to rush now, might as well wait till the end of the season to sign one",Spurs,Yes,jeroke8,t1_jerm25x
"There's a lot of whingers and moaners on reddit though

"I think Potter did very well at Brighton. But I don‚Äôt want another former Chelsea manager (even if it was a brief career) 

He turned us down before cause he didn‚Äôt want to work under Levy, then went running straight to Chelsea, probably just like Nagelsmann will.",Spurs,Yes,jerfo15,t1_jerfhyb
Think Potter is abit broken at the moment. Definitely not the right choice to manage us right now. Maybe in a few years we'll see.,Spurs,Yes,jerh00o,t1_jerfhyb
"I was never convinced by Potter at Brighton, but even if I was I don't he would be a good appointmemt simply because he looked like shellshocked and like a broken man towards the end of his Chelsea run. I would be worried that he needs time to debrief and learn from what happened at Chelsea before jumping into another hectic job.",Spurs,Yes,jerzvav,t1_jerii3a
"Well we saw him build a great team, probably because of their scout/recruitment setup. De Zerbi has been given that and elevated it. So I‚Äôd much rather De Zerbi if we‚Äôre going for a Brighton manager.",Spurs,Yes,jes48yp,t1_jerii3a
"We are a top 6 club, Potter is not good enough for a top 6 club. In what world would he be amazing for us.

Screw ex-Chelsea, if he flopped at United like he did at Chelsea, I wouldn't want him either.",Spurs,Yes,jes4ezs,t1_jerii3a

It's a joke but at the same time why say that if you aren't thinking of leaving/afraid of being replaced",Spurs,Yes,jerwq8w,t1_jerwlkl
I could see him going back to Dortmund,Spurs,Yes,jes42sd,t1_jerx2hw
Yeah. Its all about creating space wide and getting the wingers a chance to do something creative.,Spurs,Yes,jescrvs,t1_jes3i2e

"Fuck me, imagine him, Benta and Ugarte as a 3.",Spurs,Yes,jerlpqy,t1_jerj2o9
"But do we as a club love Dyche sides? We always struggled to collect points against Burnley. How many bloody 0-1s and 1-0s we had to suffer through

bruh how did we even get a point lol.,Spurs,Yes,jeu3q4p,t1_jeu2qb7
"I have been with you this whole time. 

He doesn‚Äôt even attempt to press, which absolutely has a trickle down effect to the other players, especially when we are supposed to be ‚Äúdefensive oriented.‚Äù

Rebuild with a new manager and focus on Richarlison and Kulusevski leading the charge, in addition to summer signings",Spurs,Yes,jeu4hh9,t1_jeu3kf7

"I'd like to see him get Neymar, Messi and mbappe run 2km before each match.",Spurs,Yes,jergfb7,t1_jerg2er
He'd complain about no transfer funding after dropping 500M in the summer after exiting in the R16 again,Spurs,Yes,jerifvs,t1_jerg2er

De Zerbi is clear of potter.,Spurs,Yes,jes3cmj,t1_jerxegb
This squad is nowhere near good enough to get top 4 with the current mentality. Their peak is top 4 as evidenced by last year but if they can‚Äôt be bothered to show up after being called gutless by their coach then it ain‚Äôt happening,Spurs,Yes,jeuc2ob,t1_jeubvwt

"We got 4th and 71 points with this exact squad with less players last season. I haven‚Äôt really bought into the hate on our players this time around. Dier is clearly not good enough and Pochettino knows that

I just like our depth, I‚Äôve grown so used to paper-thin squads that get run into the ground. Son, Kulusevski and Richarlison are good forward options, our midfield is the best it‚Äôs been in years, we need a Lloris replacement ASAP and the defense needs to go to a back 4 and suddenly things look a lot better

Getting outnumbered in midfield every week has really really hurt us",Spurs,Yes,jesumo3,t1_jessce6

Stellini is just another terrorist. Did you see Dier and Lloris clearly hindered by his negative system?,Spurs,Yes,jeu38mt,t1_jeu253t
Lmfao how is that the final stat. I thought it would have been much worse than that after the graphic Sky showed for the attempts and possession after our goal.

"Brighton have an extremely difficult schedule, and although I'd like to see them do well, I don't see them finishing above 6th. They have 5 of the big 6 to play.

Brentford are definitely not passing us as they have even less games at hand and difficult matchess to play also.

I joked a lot yesterday on the sub but honestly at this point I will take a direction with someone that wants to be here with a plan and attacking football over waiting and missing out.

"His problem was playing a flat 6 in attack. There were just no spaces to run into/attack or combine. Most of the time, it was Musiala trying to dribble through.",Spurs,Yes,jet1oea,t1_jeszt9d
Driving is amazing and therapeutic. What sucks ass is to watch (or listening) Spurs play.,Spurs,Yes,jet7m4h,t1_jet53xu
Still think Bryan requires one more loan to be a player for us.,Spurs,Yes,jes4gb4,t1_jes466x
"It‚Äôs over today.  We will wind up in 7th.  Brighton, Brentford will pass us.",Spurs,Yes,jev06i0,t1_jeupjyw
That is one reason the other is because the only thing Son is good at is running onto balls.  He cannot play off the turn.  Any turn.,Spurs,Yes,jeuzyqy,t1_jeuq5vq
When did I say it wasn't. Lol all I said was Son should go somewhere else to finish his career with some dignity.,Spurs,Yes,jev1oky,t1_jeuq5vq
Honest question: Is there any limit to how badly this club is run before it makes you question your loyalty to the club? I'm not saying I'm there but I don't think it's impossible for me to become completely jaded and lose interest if things stay the same or get worse,Spurs,Yes,jerygbq,t1_jeripaw
Can't be arsed to find it but he said something about considering Spurs around the AVB time but turned it down bc of the hire & fire culture. Google it.,Spurs,Yes,jerja35,t1_jerj25k
"I think when that happens it will usually either be with a lopsided formation where the opposite fullback pushes up, or for teams who dominate possession and want to basically overload the midfield. Quite specific situations",Spurs,Yes,jesb26g,t1_jesa0f4
"Ai but that tends to work by being a bit lopsided no?

Like you'll have White, he'll tuck into a 3, and then Zinchenko gets free reign up his side.",Spurs,Yes,jesalwf,t1_jesa0f4
Don't forget our very own superJan being used at fullback. Also Japh did bits there under Mou and Davies could also be an example of a more CB like player playing as fullback.,Spurs,Yes,jesbv0t,t1_jesa0f4
Spain should prefer Alba and Balde to Reguilon.,Spurs,Yes,jesc467,t1_jesbjf5
Games in hand are worth nothing when you can‚Äôt win them. Remember us in 20/21...,Spurs,Yes,jesv1bs,t1_jesug2y
Omg totally forgot about them!!,Spurs,Yes,jesdrl8,t1_jesdcwf
"I'm still convinced Son's form and deteriorating form all around is due to Conte's system and Perisic's place in that system. I want to see what a strong connection with someone else behind Son looks like.

Fucking got rid of Reggie. What a shambles. Conte got rid of a working combination just to shoehorn in his system he's comfortable with.",Spurs,Yes,jeu9i29,t1_jeu8etq
"I mean, there is a whole separate thread specifically devoted to pre-match discussion.  That there isn't a bunch of talk about it in this thread on a different topic isn't that shocking.",Spurs,Yes,jesyme6,t1_jesqpya
"Indeed but we have just sacked our coach because the team was so shit and his assistant has stayed on for continuity.  We also have an injury crisis and the club seems to be struggling to find a manager due to having not Director of Football.  

Tonight is a must win or top 4 dreams will be over, but we are already significant outsiders due to United losing to Newcastle yesterday.  

Unlike last year I think top 4 this year would be the real miracle.  I would be stunned.",Spurs,Yes,jesrfik,t1_jesqpya
"I agree. He‚Äôs the closest manager we could get to a sure thing. Because we know exactly what we‚Äôre getting. 

Looking at what psg is currently doing this season I‚Äôm hoping people put respect back on our boys name. With 9 games left, they‚Äôre 20 points, 30 goals scored, and 6 goals against behind where they finished last year. 

At least when they went out against the eventual winners Madrid (who also knocked Chelsea, City, and Liverpool) in Champions league they dominated  Madrid for 150 minutes and looked damn good doing it. Then lost on stupid individual errors and not tactics. 

Went on a lil Poch rant lol.

Tldr; Poch is good. Which is why he‚Äôll go to Madrid.",Spurs,Yes,jere86j,t1_jerd5e9
You actually have no idea what Poch wants. He may have a massive hard-on for Madrid. No idea why everyone seems to think Poch is just sitting by the phone waiting for Levy.,Spurs,Yes,jerew77,t1_jerd5e9
"Madrid would want him because he's one of the few ""elite managers"" (people who have managed the big boys and whose reputation isn't down the drain). He's a name the fans won't crucify them for hiring and he speaks Spanish.

I'm not saying his tactics are completely outdated, just some aspects of the way he presses. Like I said, Nathan did a great video on the subject.

As for who would want to work with Levy at this point. I guess some people who haven't worked with him might naively hope that it isn't actually that bad or that it won't be like that for them (the classic fallacy of the thinking ""I can change him"").",Spurs,Yes,jesl356,t1_jesj7p4
"I wouldn't sweat it, the place is swarming with Arsenal flairs now they're doing well. Genuinely I think I've seen the number of them triple since the end of last season",Spurs,Yes,jermdq2,t1_jermaja
"Here? Nah, most of yall are dickriding him daily",Spurs,Yes,jeulj08,t1_jeuknq7
"Eh, I dunno. He did a very good job at Brighton and his entire career previously. He was at Chelsea for 6 months and it‚Äôs hard to judge someone based on their time at Chelsea even at the best of times let alone their current ownership mess. 

If he joined in the summer he‚Äôd have had a few months off anyway to get his head back in the game.",Spurs,Yes,jerj6d9,t1_jerh00o
Yeah could do,Spurs,Yes,jes57ja,t1_jes42sd
Yeah that really isn't that different to Conte so I will pass,Spurs,Yes,jeserk1,t1_jescrvs
"Ik you‚Äôre not taking a dig at me, I‚Äôm laughing at this chill.

> They have just seen a bald head in Eredivisie and they automatically think he is as good as ETH.

üòÇüòÇ",Spurs,Yes,jes5qf9,t1_jes5gmf
we need to do something though. Levy should be criticized if he wants to wait on the DOF decision before Paratici is employed. Let's get some rumors at least.,Spurs,Yes,jescutp,t1_jes8cbo
"Excellent at dribbling, good defensive workrate (Not a Ndombele-type luxury player), solid at passing. I feel like he has the ability to play CAM although they tend to play him deeper at Lorient. He kind of reminds me of a Frenkie De Jong with how he can carry the ball from defence to the final third. He'll be great for helping us build out from the back and retain possession.",Spurs,Yes,jerl9tx,t1_jerixzv
"Oh and also he recently revealed he would leave Lorient at the end of the season. I feel like since Arsenal are going to go for Rice most likely, we would have a generally free run at him as well. only risk is United but if they potentially spend too much time on trying to get De Jong we can snatch him.",Spurs,Yes,jerldy4,t1_jerixzv
We didn‚Äôt deserve a point I‚Äôm dead serious. Dreadful stuff all around. I‚Äôm so sick and tired of it. I‚Äôm emotional but I thought after the first half I‚Äôm enjoying this actually. Then it all crumbled.,Spurs,Yes,jeu4ax4,t1_jeu3q4p
"100%. What‚Äôs the point of keeping him anyways?? We‚Äôre not doing shit next season, just get the money and buy 2-3 quality players.",Spurs,Yes,jeu4txw,t1_jeu4hh9
"What, do you disagree?",Spurs,Yes,jeu3wgx,t1_jeu3tyq
"If Conte went there, Lukaku would come back.",Spurs,Yes,jerh08a,t1_jergess
might even win the league.,Spurs,Yes,jes3ted,t1_jerm21z
I have heard the name. But didn‚Äôt know to which league they belonged to.,Spurs,Yes,jesd2ih,t1_jesc9b3
"I know you‚Äôre joking but I‚Äôm genuinely interested to see if Beale, Gerrards former assistant manager will do a good job. He seemed be in high demand after his good start at QPR, with Wolves reportedly approaching him.",Spurs,Yes,jes125j,t1_jerzdjd
"Rangers were playing shite football, it was just working in Scotland",Spurs,Yes,jerzzi1,t1_jerzdjd
">rangers were playing good football under gerrard

Rangers weren't playing good football mate.",Spurs,Yes,jerzj44,t1_jerzdjd
They weren't though,Spurs,Yes,jerzo0r,t1_jerzdjd
Agreed that he needs some Prem experience before making the move to a top 6 club.,Spurs,Yes,jesazo9,t1_jesa0v6
Yeah dele had a batshit insane work rate. Him and eriksen covered more ground than like anyone else in the PL back then,Spurs,Yes,jet307i,t1_jet2j0v
"It's April 19, not August. Not like it's any better lol we won't hire anybody in time anyways.",Spurs,Yes,jeuf5y9,t1_jeu9g0u
Well let's hope you're right because I can't see us making big changes to the squad or adequately replacing Kane when the time comes anyway.,Spurs,Yes,jet2ofp,t1_jesumo3
Fair point,Spurs,Yes,jerv28l,t1_jerm0x2
"> At worst we finish 6th unless we have a legitimate bottle and lose almost all of our next few matches.

Which is kind of what I'm expecting. Imo we will beat Bournemouth, Palace and Leeds, draw to Brentford and lose to Brighton, United, Newcastle, Liverpool and Villa. A lot will depend on Brighton imo, if they manage to get some points we could finish below them, if not then maybe we cling on to 6th. Brentford don't really have a chance yeah, for some reason I thought they have an easy schedule.",Spurs,Yes,jeuixu1,t1_jeuhnc0
Sacrifice Joe Lewis to the Old Ones for good fortune while we're at it.,Spurs,Yes,jeuevg7,t1_jeuc07f
And how on earth would you connect that back to Poch rejections and admiting misstakes?,Spurs,Yes,jes22sd,t1_jes1j0y
Was not obvious,Spurs,Yes,jeu4s6t,t1_jeu4jyn
Tony bloom owner or dof?,Spurs,Yes,jesuq0a,t1_jespwy9
"Yes it would, I am weary of him, but for some reason not as much as with potter",Spurs,Yes,jestxou,t1_jesr9t9
"This. Ever since we lost that champions league final its 
been downhill, levy hasnt made the right decision since. 

Building the stadium was great and all but its all ultimately a waste if we cant compete with the other top clubs, we should have won something during poch's tenure but we ultimately fell short like we always seem to do these days.

A real shame",Spurs,No,jeuunqh,t1_jeuskt3
"I truly believe most people wanting Levy out still acknowledge what he's done in the past, but it's just tiring repeating that over and over when all you're met with is pure ignorance and the classic ""fuck off without Levy we'd be nothing so he must stay forever, anyone who takes his spot will be worse"" kind of answer.",Spurs,No,jeuvdme,t1_jeuskt3
Not really mean but it would be stupid,Spurs,Yes,jeu9lmi,t1_jeu9ezn
"I'm not surprised you also believe Jose deserved to get sacked before a Cup Final. How could you possibly say something as outlandish as that shit bruh Son to Fenerbahce? What! Honestly Son should go to Liverpool, he'd do so much better in a Klopp system. maybe Brighton as well in a De Zerbi system.",Spurs,Yes,jeua57n,t1_jeu9ezn
Yes but the day after he got sacked the odds were 1/1.,Spurs,Yes,jerd88s,t1_jerd6uh
"exactly I have 12 DOF targets I could talk about too, but I might just make a post about these Directors and an analysis of each of them.",Spurs,Yes,jes4xml,t1_jes4rix
"It'll be reet, after tonight we'll have all week to talk about how Stellini-ball is worse than Conte-ball and we're doomed",Spurs,Yes,jes58gp,t1_jes4rix
We just have no sense of direction either when it comes to managers and DOF and I hope Levy figures it out. Don't let this end up like Nuno ffs.,Spurs,Yes,jes5np4,t1_jes4rix
Not if Chelsea get Poch,Spurs,Yes,jes6zs3,t1_jes5kdu
"I mean, are you talking about the less than 1 season where he was a good and decent rising player in 2017-2018 up until the World Cup?",Spurs,Yes,jeub407,t1_jeuaru0
Like the time he gave the ball away to West Ham to make it 3-3,Spurs,Yes,jevhkx0,t1_jeuaru0
are you genuinely having a stroke?,Spurs,Yes,jevkpyb,t1_jeuaru0
"I don't think it's a bad thing. We've had three former Prem coaches and they stunk up the joint. 

And I think you need to give time for these coaches to full emerse their culture in the club. Look at Klopp, Pep and Arteta. All of them have made the club their own. 

Similarly Ten Haag needs time. And whoever we get in needs time. So be it Slot or De Zerbi or that Celtic dude. We need to let them cook.",Spurs,Yes,jercvfw,t1_jercmlu
Ten Hag is doing a great job with that squad. Not sure what you are on about.,Spurs,Yes,jerd24a,t1_jercmlu
">In everything else this sub wants someone premier league proven except our coach for some weird reason

Speak for yourself, considering nearly every ""PL proven"" player we got last summer turned out to be a complete flop, maybe the issue is about misprofiling players rather than whether they played in the same league or not.

Who do you want as a PL proven coach anyway? Rodgers? No thanks, I'm taking Nagelsmann, Slot, Enrique, etc. any day over that fraud.

You also complain about Ten Hag and then conveniently ignore De Zerbi, Pep, Klopp etc.",Spurs,Yes,jerinbs,t1_jercmlu
Edu is 10x the DoF paratici is,Spurs,Yes,jeuully,t1_jeurli5
"But in all honesty, pre-transfer we would have considered Richarlison about on par with Gabriel Jesu. While Bissouma, Benta, Perisic were also considered to be pretty good players. It seems more like the problem is we don't know how to use our players.",Spurs,Yes,jeum6j3,t1_jeulacu
"I agree with you about Levy, but you must add Bentancur and Porro there.",Spurs,Yes,jeulknx,t1_jeulacu
"Where I live driving is not fun, but spurs can make it a little better or immensely worse for sure",Spurs,Yes,jetdegt,t1_jet7m4h
He mainly needs to be one of 4 attackers not one of 3 as he will never have enough end product for what is required from him in our current system,Spurs,Yes,jes4y7h,t1_jes4gb4
"Brentford have a difficult schedule are 7 points behind us with 1 game at hand.

Brighton are 7 points behind us with 2 games at hand but 5 of the big six to play.

Manchester united and liverpool are looking to be as inconsistent as we are currently and Newcastle can't be trusted to not draw every match they have remaining.

It isn't that unlikely, Fivethirtyeight says we have a 20% chance, but at the end of the day what happens happens. I'd say the real doom and gloom comes if we lose to brighton on saturday.",Spurs,Yes,jev2f53,t1_jev06i0
this is true but this isn't a problem if Son is utilized correctly.,Spurs,Yes,jev392z,t1_jeuzyqy
"I mean yeah, generally if supporting a club is seriously bad for your mental health, causes real depression, etc, you'd be foolish to prioritize a football team over the actual quality of your life.

That being said, personally I think people here are really over exaggarating on how bad things are. It's not our best season but c'mon, this is still miles better than the 90s and so on.",Spurs,Yes,jestqwu,t1_jerygbq
No,Spurs,Yes,jf64thm,t1_jerygbq
"Well that explains why I couldn't find it if it was a decade ago.

I get the feeling that kind of thing blows over with that sort of time considering we've been linked with him like 20 more times since.",Spurs,Yes,jerjlla,t1_jerja35
Fair enough,Spurs,Yes,jerm3qs,t1_jerja35
Yep and Davies would be well suited for the tuck-in role on the left. It could definitely work for us,Spurs,Yes,jesbk2c,t1_jesalwf
"Davies is a full back playing at CB, not the other way round.  He's play at LB for a decade before he was playing CB regularly.",Spurs,Yes,jesfbmk,t1_jesbv0t
"absolutely true, but my counterpoint is that the reason Reguilon isn't first choice replacement for Alba now is bc of the bad years he spent at Spurs, so in my dreams he still has it in him",Spurs,Yes,jesce1d,t1_jesc467
"absolutely. 

Son + Davies is better than Perisic + Danjuma but if they are going to play Perisic you have to play Danjuma next to him not son.",Spurs,Yes,jeuah1x,t1_jeu9i29
It's unusual,Spurs,Yes,jet1r6x,t1_jesyme6
"I guess for me it's not any different than the thousands of other full-fledged crises I've been through with Spurs now. Business as usual really.

Yeah it's a long shot but it's far from certain. Much better than being stuck midtable with literally nothing to play for. It's times like these, whenever everyone else is checked out and everything looks hopeless, that I find the most meaning...usually means something good is just over the horizon (e.g. Ramos --> Redknapp; AVB --> Poch)",Spurs,Yes,jesskat,t1_jesrfik
Lesson is we shouldn't have sacked him and should've gave him a new proper playmaker instead of wasting money on Ndombele and Locelso.,Spurs,Yes,jerfzyl,t1_jere86j
"Okay Ryan from just outside Philadelphia

If you want Levy out so much why not get out there and do something about it",Spurs,Yes,jeum54d,t1_jeulj08
Even if it wasn't his fault it still must be crushing for the biggest opportunity of your career to end in total disaster beyond your worst nightmares. I still like him but getting him now would be horrible for the optics/mood at the club and I don't think he would be able to give his best either,Spurs,Yes,jerl3mn,t1_jerj6d9
"It is very different. Conte also likes space on the wings, but he wants different things done from that position. He prefers crosses from the edge of the box, into either the opposite wingback or a forward. Slot prefers to get his players in behind and a cut back into a forward or midfielder who has made a run.",Spurs,Yes,jesywvx,t1_jeserk1
"Paratici wont be sacked until the appeal process is over, and he wont be replaced until he‚Äôs sacked. Realistically rumours don‚Äôt mean anything until we actually take action and vacate the position",Spurs,Yes,jesdt0m,t1_jescutp
Contracts and employment law still exist regardless of your anxieties,Spurs,Yes,jesenii,t1_jescutp
Love that. Sounds like exactly the type of player we need tbh.,Spurs,Yes,jerlqzz,t1_jerl9tx
"I absolutely agree. We don't deserve shit.

We deserve to be relegated from that horrific performance.",Spurs,Yes,jeu53ya,t1_jeu4ax4
"> just get the money and buy 2-3 quality players.

you'll get 5 rotation players and be happy with it",Spurs,Yes,jeu9l4k,t1_jeu4txw
100M isn't really going to get you 2-3 quality players these days sadly,Spurs,Yes,jevie7t,t1_jeu4txw
I want to sell Kane for as much money as possible. I refuse to believe we can only get 100 million out of him.,Spurs,Yes,jeu50j1,t1_jeu3wgx
"Oh right I forgot about him. Still my point stands, he can only come back next season

Then they only need two B2B‚Äôs like Rice and Ugarte and that squad is a title contending squad under Conte",Spurs,Yes,jerh4ra,t1_jerh08a

">Which is kind of what I'm expecting. Imo we will beat Bournemouth, Palace and Leeds, draw to Brentford and lose to Brighton, United, Newcastle, Liverpool and Villa

I feel like united and liverpool we could get a draw depending on which version of either team we play against. Those two have been about as inconsistent as we have been and united have a pretty busy schedule in april(europa league, fa cup).

I don't see brighton getting more than 9 points out of their matches against us, City, Chelsea, UTD, and arsenal though crazier things have happened. It would be nice if they could as I do like the way brighton have built their squad and they would be cool to see play in the champions league. Wish we could have had similar recruitment, energy, and playstyle but sadly we've ghosted this season.

For now I feel like most of our season hinges on our match against brighton on the weekend. If we lose I think we capitulate and finish 6th or 7th depending on how much worse we do than liverpool and brighton.

Edit: I forgot about newcastle challenging for top 4. They've been pretty inconsistent but it seems like they may get a run of form just at the right time.",Spurs,Yes,jeulbmb,t1_jeuixu1
Because I think Levy is unable to accept that he is at least partly responsible for what happened with Pochettino and what has happened since. Not signing any players for two windows was a mistake. Sacking him when we did was a mistake. Hiring Mourinho was a mistake. I wonder if Levy sees these events as mistakes is all and if he has rejected the opportunity to bring him back when according to all reports he was desperate to come in our last manager search it suggests to me that he is unwilling to do so.,Spurs,Yes,jes2prb,t1_jes22sd
Owner,Spurs,Yes,jesureu,t1_jesuq0a
He didn‚Äôt make the right decisions before the CL final. We limped into that final because we didn‚Äôt bring in a transfer for over a year.,Spurs,Yes,jeuwiyf,t1_jeuunqh
I‚Äôm having a bit of fun with it obviously. A way of venting my frustration,Spurs,Yes,jeuarkl,t1_jeua57n
I wouldn't bother.  It is very likely the club knows who the next DoF will be already.,Spurs,Yes,jes7b6t,t1_jes4xml
But does Poch want Chelsea?,Spurs,Yes,jes79q7,t1_jes6zs3
I'm fully on the Winks is not good enough train but our current midfield is fucking tragic,Spurs,Yes,jeub9hn,t1_jeub407
"They are just 3 points better off than last season while still playing like Ole‚Äôs counter attacking style. 

Comparing to us, their GD is 4 while we have a GD of 12 and scored 11 more goals than them. We also have conceded just 3 goals more than them. And this is with the worst defensive mistakes I have seen at Spurs in a very long time.

Though they have done well with Carabao but in the league they are mediocre and very much overrated.",Spurs,Yes,jerg38v,t1_jerd24a
Dude he literally got everyone he wanted except frenkie for massive amounts of money‚Ä¶ also look at the number of goals they scored. He‚Äôs also lucky that Rashford‚Äôs best form coincided with this period.,Spurs,Yes,jerd7ra,t1_jerd24a
"Not hard, also I don't even rate Edu like that I think he's carried by Arteta talent ID quite a bit",Spurs,Yes,jeuvyb7,t1_jeuully
"It's probably that, but also, because we have 0 vision and no clue what we're doing, we just sign players without thinking whether it makes sense or not. When you sign a player you should already know how you're planning to use them and if they can perform the role you expect them to. Instead, we sign a player first and then try to think how can he fit our squad which is just extremely dumb.",Spurs,Yes,jeup56l,t1_jeum6j3
"Bentancur was less than 20, and for Porro time will tell.",Spurs,Yes,jeuloyn,t1_jeulknx
We will play 4231 most probably so it should be okay.,Spurs,Yes,jes54u1,t1_jes4y7h
"They are going to destroy us.  That isn‚Äôt me being reactionary they are playing some good attacking football.  They will pressure the hell out of us and if we play like this today we will he beaten bad.  Everton missed a lot of gifts we gave them.

"Honestly I agree with your point but Son isn‚Äôt playing well.  Are all his issues dribbling, passing, and receiving due to Perisic in his space.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong Perisic is terrible all he can do is spam crosses.",Spurs,Yes,jev3k44,t1_jev392z

"Hence saying he's ""CB like""",Spurs,Yes,jesh3fp,t1_jesfbmk
"Because maybe you haven't noticed it yet, but Levy can do whatever the fuck he wants and unless the fans literally storm the stadium ground and toss him into the sea, he will remain chairman for as long as he wishes. All I can do is voice my discontent, which I'm certainly doing, and hope he buckles under pressure and at least removes himself entirely from football related things. And if you mean protests, don't make me laugh. United fans protested against the Glazers in amounts we could only dream of, and guess what the Glazers are still there. 

I'd gladly go to the stadium more often btw., to sing anti Levy songs with the people there, but our beloved chairman made us have the most expensive tickets in Europe (that he's planning to raise in case you forgot). I respect my money too much to pay such amounts for the crappy football he's been serving for so long now.",Spurs,Yes,jeuodd5,t1_jeum54d
Exactly. People here always seem to neglect the human element. The man probably needs time to recover before he is ready to give his best to another club.,Spurs,Yes,jes009e,t1_jerl3mn
Yep. Both Potter and the club will be under alot of scrutiny and pressure if we hire him straight after his disastrous spell at Chelsea. The optics aren't great tbh for Levy if he hires Potter now. That's why I don't think he'll go for it.,Spurs,Yes,jernt1a,t1_jerl3mn
"Levy is making a mistake here.

I just hope he has DOF replacement targets in mind before the appeal process is over.",Spurs,Yes,jesdzcn,t1_jesdt0m
"can we get some rumors about upcoming DOF targets at least just like we had rumors about upcoming managers we were looking at before Conte was sacked.

The only one we have been linked with is Rui Costa (and it was from a bad source).",Spurs,Yes,jesew40,t1_jesenii
I don‚Äôt even care about CL. Usually I‚Äôd have my heart pounding about top 4. But genuinely idc atm. Let‚Äôs just fix this club,Spurs,Yes,jeu586h,t1_jeu53ya

">He‚Äôs also lucky that Rashford‚Äôs best form coincided with this period

"I agree with that sentiment and its probably one of the biggest, if not the biggest reason why we're always in this mess.",Spurs,Yes,jev1xaa,t1_jeup56l

"I agree with you on Brighton beating us. I feel like the best we can hope for from that match is a draw. I think the same can be said from the newcastle and united matches too. United has a really busy april and that could take a toll on them when they face us. 

Normally It shouldn't even be a problem if we lose to two of Liverpool, UTd, Newcastle, Brighton. But Spurs being spurs we keep ghosting against lower table sides. If we could put teams like everton and southampton away I wouldn't even be worried about our chances at all. But of course that isn't the case. 

I can see brighton doing well in their last few matches and passing us but I seriously don't see brentford finishing anywhere above 7th.",Spurs,Yes,jev3siz,t1_jev2uwl

It's like he suddenly realised they're capable of hiring such renowned managers and said fuck all rhyme and reason, let's get the big names.

Also, how the fuck did Mou and Conte not know what they were walking into? During their tenures we had a few good players, mostly mediocre players, and shit for depth.

I have been thinking a bit about what it is that creates anxiety in me as a Spurs fan at the moment. It isn‚Äôt WHO the manager is or will be as much as the UNCERTAINTY that I feel.  There is so much uncertainty as a club and it has been present even before this season started.  Conte‚Äôs reluctance to ever really commit beyond last year was always evident and cast a shadow over our future.  The DOF‚Äôs legal issues cast a shadow as well as will Kane stay or go?  I think as a fan that is super hard to feel good about your club with so many big question marks.  I feel like it keeps me from seeing what the plan is our future May hold.  I would rather see us right now sort out who a new DOF would be and hire a manager who wants to come now and begin building a future.  I want us to figure out if we will sell Harry and Son and begin planning a real rebuild of the team.  I think if we were given a clear direction with a leader (DOF) of the project and a Gaffer who played a style of football we found pleasing many of us would feel settled and happier.

In my opinion Chelsea and Liverpool will probably sort this out by next year and Brighton and Brentford seem solidly run, Newcastle has Money now, and United will buy more in the summer.

"Rodgers took Leicester from a team in 9th place to a team constantly competing for the Champions League spots. potter took a Chelsea team from 6th in the League table to 11th in the League.

I seriously don't get why people think Potter is a better or at least more proven manager than Rodgers is. The evidence speaks for itself. Even at Brighton, when Houghton finished with 40 points, Potter first finished with 36 points (2 points off relegation), then brought Brighton up to 41 points (7 points off relegation), then brought Brighton back to 41 points (13 points off relegation), then was able to bring Brighton to their most impressive season last year of 51 points (16 points off relegation).

Under Rodgers Leicester first finished in 9th with 52 points after finishing with 47 points the season before Rodgers arrived. Then Rodgers bottled it by finishing with 62 points only 4 points off of third and 4th with Leicester. Then he was able to finish with 66 points (only three points off of third place Liverpool at the time), and then came the collapse where he finished with 52 points (barely above Potter's Brighton) and then getting relegated.

Clearly Rodgers has shown he is more likely to be able to be a manager that can get you into the top 4 race more than Potter can. He is more suitable with us.

Obviously what Potter has done is very impressive but clearly he definitely has shown at Chelsea that he is not ready for a Big 6 club yet. meanwhile Rodgers, (even though he did collapse and bottle it) has shown even at Liverpool then he can challenge for a title with a big club.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

"""The same cadre of posters""? So what, you've gone back and checked through a bunch of people's comment history to check for consistency? 

Fwiw, I think spending big on lots of players in a short space of time is exactly the opposite of how Potter has slowly built success - incremental improvement by developing players. Seems pretty obvious that he wasn't a good fit for Chelsea and would've suited a team like us a bit better and I highly doubt anyone that wanted him here also thought splurging hundreds of millions of pounds on emerging stars on long term deals was a good plan. 

He left Ostersund and Brighton in much better places than he found them in; Swansea, he wasn't really there long enough to judge fairly, but they were very reluctant to let him leave. I think the Chelsea job is so wildly different from those, it's not surprising he's struggling. I think he's gone there too soon and accepting the job was an error of judgement from him. Perhaps coming to us would also have been a mistake, the task and expectations here are probably a bit closer to Chelsea than they are to Brighton I guess.

"Fabrizio‚Äôs been saying this for a couple of weeks already. Seemed inevitable really, but there‚Äôs still a chance the reports about Nagelsmann wanting to take some time away from the game and assess his options in the summer were true.",Spurs,Yes,jep4igp,t1_jep448k
"Discussions about players can go in the ""daily discussion"" thread.",Spurs,Yes,jeosfad,t1_jeorgza
">genuine discussion about how overrated Dier is

That sounds like a real groundbreaking piece of high effort content‚Ä¶

Also how can Dier be overrated when he gets more hate than any other player in the current squad lmfao",Spurs,Yes,jeovco0,t1_jeorgza
How is dier overrated. I haven't seen enough fans who rate dier as a cb for him to be called overrated. He is appropriately rated actually.,Spurs,Yes,jeours6,t1_jeorgza

"I don't want Potter because of what he represents (another ex-chelsea, ditched brighton in the middle of their project, acted like he was too good for us when we went after him), but comparing him to Rodgers is like comparing shit to poo",Spurs,Yes,jepcg46,t1_jepa2zq
So Newcastle can overtake us for 4th with a game in hand? No thanks a draw would be best,Spurs,Yes,jeociee,t1_jeo2hw6

"Every manager is a risk. Then they should have stuck with Mourinho or Conte to be honest. Both of them are proven winners in the EPL and the best of the lot.

at least most/all of them play attacking football which is better than the last 3 guys,Spurs,Yes,jeq6y3b,t1_jeq5mgx
I agree,Spurs,Yes,jepdpku,t1_jepccou
De Zerbi has gotten a lot more goals out of Danny Welbeck than Graham Potter ever did. IMO it is not a coincidence that Potter is an Xg god but his brighton and Chelsea teams can't score goals. it is a coaching issue as much as it is a striker issue imo.,Spurs,Yes,jepejft,t1_jepccou
"We probably one have one of those best finishers in the world next season, which will be at the front of every prospective managers mind.",Spurs,Yes,jepe445,t1_jepccou
"You can‚Äôt give him the credit for building that team, given they lost key players this season and have mostly replaced them with excellent prospects.

It‚Äôs clear they have an excellent back room setup there now. Maybe Potter had a hand in that but I‚Äôve not seen anything to indicate he had that level of control, apart from pushing a more statistical based approach to everything.",Spurs,Yes,jep884q,t1_jep6za8

I don't want to get relegated sorry,Spurs,Yes,jep75rd,t1_jep6za8
we would never be in a top 4 race ever again under Potter. Maybe he can play some nice football but we wouldn't win many games. Kane is also definitely leaving if we hire Potter.,Spurs,Yes,jep7n8e,t1_jep6za8
"He doesn't develop youth at all, his tactics are more stubborn than Conte and the foundations were definitely not laid by Potter. He's also not the one recruiting, it's the Brighton scouting department that is brilliant haha.

The only similarity between Brighton now vs under Potter is that they pass a lot. Everything else is vastly different",Spurs,Yes,jep7uxo,t1_jep6za8

"Rodgers is a serial bottler and has been awful for the past 2 years, while Potter completely shat himself at Chelsea. It's like choosing between diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, both options are terrible and we're better off without any of them.",Spurs,Yes,jeplkd1,t1_jepk5qi
It's simple. Potter's tactics are better than Rodgers and scale better,Spurs,Yes,jeq1ddg,t1_jepk5qi
"Constantly competing in the CL? Leicester haven‚Äôt made CL even once under Rodgers

It‚Äôs very apparent you live in an alternate reality",Spurs,Yes,jepoq3e,t1_jepk5qi
"Rodgers did well at Liverpool with the then third best player in the world who was then in his prime. He also had Sturridge who linked up well with Suarez and the corpse of Steven Gerrard which was still better than the majority of midfielders at that time. 

As for Leicester, sure, but the fall has been significant. Football moves fast, I think Rodgers is a bit beneath us to be honest.",Spurs,Yes,jepn71d,t1_jepk5qi
I think he's a great manager potential but it's not great optics to go for someone who has flunked big time at a rival.,Spurs,Yes,jemxw9n,t1_jemxh7n
I absolutely loved Potter before he went to Chelsea but i think they broke him,Spurs,Yes,jemyfy6,t1_jemxh7n

">Flop after flop manager

There are way more than two options available why does it have to be one of those mugs,Spurs,Yes,jepfqk8,t1_jepe3fi

"Play it back to the keeper, then to a CB, hold it in one place for 5 seconds, draw the press in, long ball up to no one. People wonder why our defense looks so shaky at times, it‚Äôs because they are constantly under pressure because we don‚Äôt have good possession or put teams under much threat with the ball when we do have it",Spurs,Yes,jeocdwy,t1_jeo9mmy
"Yeah but I‚Äôll take what I can get, and watching their fans silenced at Stamford Bridge while the team loses yet again despite spending more money than a small country feeds my soul. It‚Äôs not relegation but I‚Äôll take it",Spurs,Yes,jen3ccu,t1_jen3773
">they just win the league the next season lmao

yeah but they really wont",Spurs,Yes,jen7y6p,t1_jen3773
They'll stay up purely because Brighton and Leicester are even worse. Bethany England must wonder what she's got herself into though.,Spurs,Yes,jeo16sb,t1_jent109
It would feel very‚Ä¶bad.,Spurs,Yes,jeppb6v,t1_jepof6s
"I think Poch wanted out and the CL final masked a lot of deficiencies to an extent. Some of it was on Levy, some of it was on Poch. But ‚Äî if they have figured out a way forward ‚Äî I am all in on getting him back. I do think Poch needs a DOF though.",Spurs,Yes,jeppioc,t1_jepotot
Casemiro when not playing makes them look ordinary and vulnerable,Spurs,Yes,jeod7ot,t1_jeoas5c
Sorry but it's absurd to think they came just for a payout. If you're a high level competitor you're in it to win.,Spurs,Yes,jepknw3,t1_jepj7zq

Yeah and apparently he is on a holiday currently. Chelsea are gonna push for him but very very difficult to get it done.,Spurs,Yes,jep7aia,t1_jep6t5y
"That‚Äôs a really salient point. I have faith in Stellini, I think we only lost one game under him? And we played better football too seemingly the shackles come off to some extent when Antonio is out of the picture which he firmly is now of course.

"he got rejected because of Paratici (according to some fans here). Maybe if we get rid of Paratici, he'd be willing to join again?",Spurs,Yes,jenva3a,t1_jenuwh1
Easier to plan of course when you have the finances of a Saudi sovereign wealth fund to the tune of 600 billion behind you. Agree though that Howe is doing a good job.,Spurs,Yes,jeolml7,t1_jeojnii

"Is he back? Meh, Forster did well except for the first game, and he passes better. I'd be happy with Forster for the rest of the season.",Spurs,Yes,jeoidiq,t1_jeoi01m

I'll still take him. I like him a lot more than Rodgers or potter at least.,Spurs,Yes,jeoksp2,t1_jeok23u
"They're reporting that he had a clause in his contract where they didn't have to pay the full 50M to him. Probably something to do with being in the bottom half of the league.

Which is to my point even if we finish top 4 we really have been shitty.,Spurs,Yes,jeohsf5,t1_jeohn6a
Gordon is overrated but he provides exactly what Howe needs in his team.,Spurs,Yes,jeojtrv,t1_jeoiyoi

"Sorry, name one striker that‚Äôs excellent at Chelsea?",Spurs,Yes,jep90n3,t1_jep72ew
"He is a kind of manager that needs lots of time. In his 3 years at Brighton only last season they finished mid table(and with a GD of -2). The other 2 seasons, they were closer to relegation.

"Agree. I think he's great but I don't want any ex-Chelsea managers anymore and sadly he's tainted by that now. 

I wanted him in summer 2021. I think both us and Chelsea would have been way better off hiring Potter and Conte (again) respectively, I think  both would have been so much better suited to each others clubs. Presumably Conte burned too many Stamford Bridges though and I don't think Potter was finished with Brighton at that time though.",Spurs,Yes,jemuvga,t1_jemp920
"The fact that Brighton - _Brighton_ - are pushing for Europe is as much down to the years he put in developing that team, not just De Zerbi's last seven months.",Spurs,Yes,jemuc43,t1_jempwaq
Also I doubt Kane would move and betray the fans for a carabao cup,Spurs,Yes,jeoig9m,t1_jeohjqc
Yeah but according to rival fans a Mickey Mouse cup that we won doesn‚Äôt count? So we gotta be consistent.,Spurs,Yes,jeoiexs,t1_jeohjqc
"Shit man, can't believe I'm going to be pessimistic to *you* but you seem to be huffing some serious copium today.

"Kane is clear though.

I hope they don't want him. I want him to stay.",Spurs,Yes,jeoopjq,t1_jeonbi8
It seems highly likely to happen if they get CL and we don't.,Spurs,Yes,jeovdrr,t1_jeokq67
agreed. and he almost got Leicester into the CL three years in a row  (even if he bottled it) which is pretty impressive tbh. I still prefer other managers though.,Spurs,Yes,jepkcjd,t1_jepguo9
No chance now. He's ex Chelsea and he might be broken,Spurs,Yes,jepbl5h,t1_jep8v8m

I just think De Zerbi is basically world class even if he is less proven.",Spurs,Yes,jeo45f2,t1_jeo2stt

Zidane,Spurs,Yes,jen20mm,t1_jen1ev4
What kind of an arbitrary reference point is doing better than before? You‚Äôre just using anything and everything to convince yourself that Poch isn‚Äôt the man for the job,Spurs,Yes,jen3bul,t1_jen1ev4
Can‚Äôt believe nobody else has said this it‚Äôs so obvious that going back to Poch would be a massive implicit acknowledgement of mistakes and failure from Levy he‚Äôll do everything to avoid looking like we‚Äôre taking a step backwards,Spurs,Yes,jenmxnz,t1_jen12uh
What do you think Poch did when he first came to Spurs?,Spurs,Yes,jen22pp,t1_jen1ef9
"I totally acknowledge this and agree, but we're currently in a situation where we don't have a Director or Football, Poch is a manager who works without one. We have had a series of managers who don't want to be at the club, Poch bleeds Tottenham, he knows the infrastructure of the club and what he's dealing with, and we're in a better spot financially to support his transfers.  


We can and will likely lose perhaps 1 or 2 of those senior players as it is, and I'm not too sure if Kane stays. So at that point he basically just has Son, Dier, Davies and Lloris left if I'm not mistaken.  


Seems like a good free hit at a new rebuild IMO.",Spurs,Yes,jen22m0,t1_jen1ef9
I mean it is just kane and son really lol,Spurs,Yes,jen21m2,t1_jen1ef9

I didn't suffer terrorist football for 3 years only to be rewarded with some mid ass manager",Spurs,Yes,jep3mga,t1_jep338i
"It's not just managing. Ten Hag had assistance manager stints outside of Holland. Especially at Bayern. This influenced his play style a lot, so his football is a lot more varied than someone like Slot. Usually dutch managers struggle outside of the dutch league (FdB for example). ETH is an exception because of how his football developed

Nathan on The Extra Inch had a really good rant about it on the latest episode, it's worth listening to",Spurs,Yes,jep3k08,t1_jep33g9
If we were an actual big club and not a shit club pretending to be one we could get De Zerbi,Spurs,Yes,jepc2vy,t1_jep3zio
I also think (as much as I hate to admit it) that Newcastle is a much better situation than Tottenham is especially with the mess regarding Paratici and our next manager.,Spurs,Yes,jeootw7,t1_jeomutb

he wanted to join Manchester City....,Spurs,Yes,jeolepq,t1_jeol6fv
"Yeah failing at Chelsea rarely ends up tarnishing a managers reputation (Potter may be the first in a long time, though) so he could be ‚Äòthe man who saved Chelsea‚Äô or just another manager who failed to meet the unrealistically high expectations at Spurs.

A poo wins a FA cup with Leicester. BR is a top manager. A moment comes when the journey of a team ends. It's a natural end. Just like Poch with us. We will be building a statue if our next manager gives us a FA cup.,Spurs,Yes,jepdv52,t1_jepcg46
Rodgers is miles better than Potter. Comparing them is a disgrace,Spurs,Yes,jepdaik,t1_jepcg46

"Bro don‚Äôt make shit up. Welbz last season - 6 goals in 25 matches. Last to last - 6 in 24.

"Obviously it‚Äôs an entire team not just Potter but by building I mean developing the talents Brighton give him. Caicedo is the player he is because of Potter and with the sale of Bissouma, he‚Äôs just gotten more game time. Potter already groomed him to take over from Biss even before he was sold

Same goes for White, Sanchez, Dunk, Webster, Dunk, Solly March, Gross, Trossard etc. Potter developed them into the players they are today",Spurs,Yes,jep8shs,t1_jep884q
He couldn‚Äôt get relegated with fucking Brighton after Hughton left an absolute shambles of a team lmao,Spurs,Yes,jep7aiw,t1_jep75rd
There‚Äôs no reason from you when it comes to Potter so I won‚Äôt bother,Spurs,Yes,jep7tr3,t1_jep7n8e
That‚Äôs a fantastic analogy üòÇ,Spurs,Yes,jepoxkq,t1_jeplkd1

I meant constantly competing for the CL spot.,Spurs,Yes,jeppzh0,t1_jepoq3e
good point having Luis Suarez helps. Of course Rodgers is beneath us. I just think Potter is even more beneath us than Rodgers is.,Spurs,Yes,jepnbes,t1_jepn71d

"They paid a lot more and he's been a lot better. He's also 3 years younger and actually came in to play an important starting role for them. The guy is shit but Richarlison is still so much worse as a transfer, an all time idiotic move",Spurs,Yes,jeoez6c,t1_jeoeidw

"BR is a project manager. Look at the Leicester team. He built that team around Maddison. He also inspires very high hopes within his first two years (winning league with Pool, UCL with Leicester). The only downside is those hopes do not materialize much, faltering at the last hurdle. But in the overall context, he is high achieving.",Spurs,Yes,jepf9kj,t1_jepebfp
i love this timeline. Arne Slot in!,Spurs,Yes,jepempb,t1_jepaxog

"Exactly. It‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been adamantly Conte out despite our place in the table. You can argue he doesn‚Äôt have the players he needs for Conte ball all you want but when your tactics aren‚Äôt working with the players you have, you have to adapt. Yes our CB on the whole are not great (mentality more than skill for some) but just playing the same way over and over is silly",Spurs,Yes,jeof3rl,t1_jeocdwy

"I think both of those guys have huge egos and the chance to be the manager who finally won silverware with perennial ‚Äúnearly-men‚Äù Spurs was probably a really attractive proposition to them. They obviously back themselves in whatever role they‚Äôre in, and if they‚Äôd achieved that aim then that would have banked them enough credit to be in the frame for any top job for at least a decade.",Spurs,Yes,jeprjxr,t1_jepknw3

"We have no guts. Like jeez, Bayern fired a manager that was winning to bring in a guy they thought would do better. Chelsea on the verge of firing a guy they just hired because they think they have someone better (obviously potter hasn't done well). Meanwhile we get dragged along by our top target to only have him decide he doesn't want to manage until January and then we get Nuno. Then when he finally decides to come we are just cool with him being in the media talking about his lack of commitment to the club and that the club need to show their commitment to him. As if he wasn't one of the most backed managers of our recent history. We have no plan. No guts to take risks. Levy is seemingly a ""pick-me"" type of guy. We wait around to make decisions like with Paratici. Like fuck just cut ties with him already and find someone who can actually work. I already know that ""leave it absence"" just means ""we are waiting for the results of the appeal in April to know if we need to completely fire him"" because you already know if they get a favorable answer on April 19 then they aren't going to fire him or find someone new.",Spurs,Yes,jenuj50,t1_jensklh
"this is a common thing under Levy yet people still won't criticize him for it.

You can be Levy IN but criticize him for when he messed up. Right now is an example of him messing up.

"Did he ""exceed"" his first stint? 

Doing a (not very thorough) look at trophies suggests he didn't, there was not a drop off but he didn't do *better* did he? Genuine question.

"Lol... How is improving an arbitrary reference point? hahahaha. That's point of sport. There's no glory in just making up the numbers and taking part.

I love Poch dearly, more than any coach we ever had. I don't want him to taint that tbh. Maybe he comes back and it's great, I'm not saying that's impossible but the only way I'm guaranteed he doesn't taint anything is if he doesn't come back.",Spurs,Yes,jen3lv5,t1_jen3bul
He sure as fuck didn't boot out his personal friends,Spurs,Yes,jen2zbl,t1_jen22pp
"> Poch is a manager who works without one.

And really really needs one. Poch was amazing in many ways and if we had an actual DoF instead of his awful scouting and signings we would have kicked on. The major downfall of Poch was his inability to be flexible with signings and consistently finding duds.",Spurs,Yes,jen34ra,t1_jen22m0

"I mean, I wouldn‚Äôt blame him if Madrid were legitimately interested and he chose to go there over coming back to us. For most managers it‚Äôs a once in a lifetime chance.

"And Brendan Rodgers after that has failed to make the most of players in his squad and relied heavily on Ndidi who was one of the best defensive midfielders in the league. 

You can see when Ndidi declined and had injuries as Leicester dropped off a cliff performance wise. 

Rodgers is worse than Potter easily, just look at his treatment of certain players like Iheanacho who is Leicesters best striker but hardly plays. Rodgers plays out of form players because they're favourites and is tactically inflexible",Spurs,Yes,jenv0a3,t1_jent9u9

"I'm actually surprised. You were right. I don't remember Welbeck scoring any goals under Potter.

"Can I ask why you‚Äôre so high on Slot?

I get Feyenoord haven‚Äôt been in the frame for an Eredivisie title for a long time, but Ajax are transitioning from losing a well established manager in ETH, and PSV seem to only be decent once every 3 years.

perhaps the last hurdle thing could be similar to what happened to Pochettino. Maybe Rodgers wasn't backed just like Poch wasn't and then everything fell apart. Maybe I'm being optimistic here though.,Spurs,Yes,jepfsff,t1_jepf9kj
Yeah I could actually see a gutless nil nil but my only thing is that I believe Liverpool players may be somewhat to a lot more inclined to make an effort based on Klopp. Chelsea on the other hand look like they‚Äôre mostly out of ideas.,Spurs,Yes,jeniust,t1_jenim1d
Yeah I just refuse to buy into that narrative about him not having his players when a manager with supposedly an 1/8th of the reputation of Conte (Howe) is getting more out of his squad. Most of this squad was on their way to relegation last season,Spurs,Yes,jeohyg8,t1_jeof3rl
"Mitchell hates Levy now, right?",Spurs,Yes,jepqawt,t1_jeppxx1
"In an ideal world we hire a DOF Poch can work with and vice versa and bring Poch back.

"Problem is there‚Äôs not as much turnover with top class DoFs as there is with managers. The managers largely bear the brunt of the blame when the football isn‚Äôt producing results, but it takes repeated failings across multiple seasons for DoFs to be sacked.

"for Rodgers we've pretty much seen his ceiling and it hasn't been anything spectacular. I think there's a better defense for Potter since he inherited an extremely bloated squad, but Chelsea has had some absolutely atrocious results that are pretty indefensible even if he wasn't given much time. I don't know how they even come up in a conversation with managers like Enrique/Poch/De Zerbi/Amorim/Slot. I'd even take a risk on Ange Kompany or Gallardo before them, at least there's a chance they could turn out to be really good instead of just settling for above average prem managers like Rodgers/Potter",Spurs,Yes,jeqvoii,t1_jeqrhcq

God I really want to see Danjuma play. To the point where if Stellini subs off Kulusevski at 60‚Äô for Lucas I‚Äôm going to throw a tantrum. I‚Äôve really enjoyed his football from what I‚Äôve seen,Spurs,Yes,jepawyb,t1_jeozpte
so we could still get Fonseca then right? Fair enough. I'd take him still.,Spurs,Yes,jenxp6s,t1_jenx611
"Thank you.

If this is the case then I‚Äôd rather we go all in for Poch now. There‚Äôs a risk that if we wait and Poch sees we are courting other managing, that even if he doesn‚Äôt go to Madrid he turns us down out of principle. I don‚Äôt think De Zerbi will leave Brighton, based on the above Nagelsmann is much more likely to end up at Chelsea, Enrique I don‚Äôt see staying long term, so let‚Äôs just get the guy who actually cares about the club and wants to be here and this time back him financially.",Spurs,Yes,jenfwnz,t1_jen49d1
I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs a failure if we make top 4 and if we don‚Äôt because the club is right now a rudderless ship.  Until we pick a manager and a DOF and not one that was at Chelsea or this name or that name it‚Äôs a failure.  Just my opinion.,Spurs,Yes,jeouomj,t1_jeoi4b6
They are not similar entirely. Adama is not young and hungry. He is bulky not slim. They are not looking for cheaper option but the one they can build future on.,Spurs,Yes,jeol15q,t1_jeojxsx
"Pochettino, Postecoglu, Fonseca, there are many others.",Spurs,Yes,jep94sv,t1_jep8qo9

Now it's similar but except Bruno, there's Casemiro, Rashford and Eriksen who are crucial to their success. It's still not a perfectly working machine but Ten Hag's turned them into a far more cohesive unit than they were in previous seasons.",Spurs,Yes,jep5unj,t1_jep525i
"On those 2 specific points, when exactly would you have wanted Paratici suspended? I thought we acted pretty quickly following the worldwide ban. I also don't think not spending under Poch was a decision that was made, rather, was the result of a strained budget at the time.",Spurs,Yes,jenx0kd,t1_jenwbcl
Well obviously you‚Äôll be on his back lmao. Couldn‚Äôt give a toss what the next manager has won because our best manager in recent memory hadn‚Äôt won fuck all,Spurs,Yes,jep9l6y,t1_jep9g0k
"And because his Chelsea stint was nothing short of a disaster. Don't know how can anyone want him here after this, they've been utterly hopeless since his first game with no signs of improvement, after spending well over 250 million in January alone.

I do go to games thank you very much. Anything else?,Spurs,Yes,jeo935u,t1_jeo8o4y
"Bad at manager management should have gotten a DoF for Poch, Should have let Mourinho have his final etc.

The money logic has a fault. We assume that top players can come to our club if enough money is offered. That's not true. Same for Leicester as well. This is just a reflection of the club itself. Just think of a top buy in a transfer window. Will Messi/Mbappe/ Enzo/Felix ever think of moving to Spurs in their peak? No shame in that. So any manager has to work within the constraints of dealing with underdeveloped talents no matter the backing. Poch was a master of it. Poch made the whole Spurs generation shine. And he was not allowed to rebuild again. BR also did the same with Pool. To actually win with underdeveloped talents is a very niche skill set. I guess BR has more of it than Poch.,Spurs,Yes,jepibx9,t1_jepfsff

Why would he be, he is literally Pochs favourite player. He was putting up 1/10 and 0/10 and Poch would not under any circumstance bench him, it was literally a major factor as to why he had to go.

"I think it‚Äôs moreso because of how the fans reacted when he was close to appointment. If I remember correctly the appointment didn‚Äôt go through because Fonseca wasn‚Äôt aware the salary we offered him was before tax and thus the deal broke down.

Italy has quite an attractive tax incentive for the football industry so I imagine it would‚Äôve been a large gap to fill salary wise. Personally I‚Äôm not a fan of him, would take Galtier if he was sacked at the end of the season though.

"Fair enough.

I‚Äôm not sure how much credit winning the Eredivisie really buys a manager though. Outside of the top 3 teams it‚Äôs comparable to the Championship in terms of quality.

"Paratici has done some amazing things for our club though in the short time he was here, and who knows what other improvements he's made in that time between the Italy ban and his suspension, what projects he finished up or planned out for after his departure.

The leave of absence makes sense when you look at it through a corporate lens instead of a fan lens. I was fucking about when I was a teen at a call center and basically stealing a living while I was looking for a new job, and when they found out, even with their strong evidence, they suspended me pending investigation/appeals process, it's just how jobs work. I actually resigned as soon as the suspension hit to avoid the firing on my p45 instead of resignation, but that was a minimum wage job, miles away from what's at stake for Paratici.",Spurs,Yes,jeo0oga,t1_jenyio8
"Yes, we should act quicker to get managers and players in, every single day of training that passes, is a day that the manager isn't training his side, or the player isn't learning the system.

I don't mind that much about the Super League, it's not like we were pushing for it, and honestly the fact he elevated us from where we were in the 90's to being invited to such a thing is a real display of progress. Iirc we were also quick to pulling out when it collapsed? He's just trying to position the club in the strongest place he can and that's what you want your chairman to do.

I'll also criticize the style of manager we've employed since Poch, I've backed each and every manager from the day they were brought on to the day they departed, but the style of play is just not what the fans want to see. We shouldn't have fired Poch in the first place, but since we did, we should have brought in a manager that plays positive football and works with young players instead of trying to scrap what we had and rebuild.

I mean Luke Ayling is a clown but clearly the refs want to help Arsenal.,Spurs,Yes,jeji4qq,t1_jejhny7
Well we might screw it up anyway considering that Ten Hag was rejected for a ‚Äúlack of charisma‚Äù.,Spurs,Yes,jelvijv,t1_jeluvyw
"nah.

Just bring in Pochettino if we have to resort to managers such as Graham Potter.",Spurs,Yes,jelx5hw,t1_jeluvyw
Bit better than Danjuma's loan then,Spurs,Yes,jeizu3s,t1_jeizfxg
Players are always so shortsighted and go to the biggest possible club on loan instead of talking a temporary step back to ensure playing time,Spurs,Yes,jej0cwp,t1_jeizfxg
Injuries or down the pecking order?,Spurs,Yes,jeizxii,t1_jeizfxg
"I just hope we don't reappoint him even if he wins every single rest of the game. We don't want to have our own version of Ole. 

It's too big of a risk.",Spurs,Yes,jejame3,t1_jejaggc
It‚Äôs happened before man it‚Äôll happen again. We just need to find happiness in ourselves. I‚Äôm tired of looking at the score every weekend but I simply can‚Äôt fucking bother. If they banter you point to our European wins. If they win CL then go back into antiquity and talk about Woolwich.,Spurs,Yes,jek3x3w,t1_jek3o42
"It‚Äôs not gonna happen. 

They still need to play Liverpool away, City away, Newcastle away, and Brighton or Chelsea could also nick points. 

City have a much easier run in, and the key head to head match is at the Etihad. Assuming City win their game in hand and win at home against them, it‚Äôs only a 2 point difference.",Spurs,Yes,jek97bl,t1_jek3o42
"Man i accepted early it was happening, as much as it hurts to admit it too they‚Äôve done it in a respectful way? Idk it doesn‚Äôt feel like they just bought a bunch of guys they built something.

That‚Äôs probably the part that hurts the most to me is that we could be in that position but our management is just so shambolic.

Fuck the scum but regardless of how they did it.",Spurs,Yes,jek5vdx,t1_jek3o42
Well it was gonna happen eventually. Let's just hope they win it this year and don't again for a long time instead of going on a crazy run,Spurs,Yes,jek5kil,t1_jek3o42
"We're in a crisis because for the 5th consecutive season we will have a different manager. Our DOF has cooked the books and is banned worldwide. He cannot do his job legally. The club has put their reputation on the line hoping a technicality could save him with the appeal. Even after that, there is a separate criminal trial. So not sure how long the club can continue to gamble on him.

There are loads of people internally at the club not just worried but shocked at this situation. ""Disaster"" and ""shambles"" were a couple of the words used by insiders. Others talked about the club's arrogance throughout all of this.

While our DoF cannot do his job, we need a new manager appointment done quickly. Man Utd signed Ten Hag on April 21st last season, while we will wait for Paratici's appeal till April 19th atleast. Possibly we might need a new DoF after that date as well if not earlier.

I've not even talked about player recruitment where we have a 200m loan army incoming that will complicate the situation as that is even more work to do on top of everything else, especially as we have been really bad in selling players.

The good thing is that the team is still in the top 4 and might scrape CL for next season which is always important. That gives me more hope for next season.",Spurs,Yes,jei8hok,t1_jei5l6f
"Yeah, it's a bad situation to be in right now, but I'm not worried about us in the long or even medium term. It seems pretty likely we're going to hire a coach that plays attacking football for the first time in four years and that's literally all I ask of watching this team.",Spurs,Yes,jei71nz,t1_jei5l6f
"I'll be worried if Paratici's ban gets repealed and he stays on. So far everything seems to be going to plan, hopefully he loses the appeal and gets sacked, then we can move on",Spurs,Yes,jeigpgp,t1_jei5l6f
"No I agree with you, whatever is happening it‚Äôs going to change. We needed to stick or twist and the sticking was worrying me. Now that we‚Äôre twisting I‚Äôm allowing for cautious optimism.",Spurs,Yes,jeiig65,t1_jei5l6f
"I‚Äôm with you mate. We‚Äôll be fine. Apart from stepping down, The Juve mess has nothing to do with us. New manager and we‚Äôre golden.",Spurs,Yes,jeiagc1,t1_jei5l6f
There‚Äôs just so much that needs to be done before next season. As long as we don‚Äôt get Conference League this season I‚Äôll be alright. With Poch looking like first choice for Madrid we‚Äôre really just bent over a barrel for a new manager. Wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if Levy tries his hand at management for a bit.,Spurs,Yes,jei60x5,t1_jei5l6f
It‚Äôs only a ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù because there‚Äôs an international break and journalists have nothing else to make money from.,Spurs,Yes,jeiz4ju,t1_jei5l6f

when was it",Spurs,Yes,jeio04w,t1_jeint2t
"Some people will think that is a good thing. They will say your life is bigger than a football team and it is, but really this is sad. As a spurs fan, I would love to see my team succeed and I love it when I care about how they do. When fans become detached from the team that just means the team has done so badly that you have even ruined the fan's enthusiasm for the club. this is not a good thing lol even if we are as ""obsessed"" as we are",Spurs,Yes,jej9pl0,t1_jeint2t
"Feel the same way.

It‚Äôs a larger symptom of how broken football (and our culture as a whole) is. Everything is about the money now, so nothing makes sense to normal people like us anymore",Spurs,Yes,jejhufc,t1_jeint2t
"I hope he does for his own sake if he wants to end up as a top gaffer and not just an assistant. He‚Äôs never going to get a real look in without some form of experience over a full season or two with another team.

Very satisfying to see Chelsea be this poor,Spurs,Yes,jek8je2,t1_jek89b1
"he is fun to watch, but yep his finishing is really poor. I still think we could use him at Spurs. He'd be the main guy in charge of link up play and dropping deep to create chances for Son.",Spurs,Yes,jeka638,t1_jek98yd
">last 5-6 years

"I mean I hate how we r run more than anyone but this isnt fully true? Dele Alli, Dembele, Super Jan, Walker... that being said, other than Dele, none were the main charscters like Son Kane or Lloris.

De Zerbis play style is that of a team challenging for trophies.,Spurs,Yes,jekqy32,t1_jekfmh9

Brother they‚Äôve spent ¬£500 or ¬£600 million on some of the best young players in the world. Eventually it will come together. I‚Äôd rather Nagelsmann not have that club,Spurs,Yes,jek3nz0,t1_jek3bim

"It's not a fucking Leicester lol. Leicester almost got relegated. Arsenal should have had top 4 last season but bottled it.

"Interesting point and prob not far off. I wonder if it's because in all major US sports there's a majority of bad/absent owners just due to the guaranteed money aspect of no relegation. A lot more incentive to just sit back and cash your paycheck. 

With that lens Levy is a fucking mastermind that cares so much about the club.",Spurs,Yes,jej5b1r,t1_jeixxxb
"I agree. I found it interesting how it seems like the London Spurs supporters (who actually go to the games) are much more Levy out than the American fans are lol. Yet they will always talk about we used to be midtable.... (you probably weren't even there lol).

"Cooked the books at Juventes not with spurs Levy wouldn‚Äôt let that man near the books.

I think it's on him as it's on the players. It's insane how many chances they squander but Potter makes some very questionable changes in basically every match. That 2-2 against Everton was totally on him. He was winning with a goal lead against a side battling relegation and decided to take Pulisic out who was having a good game to put on Gallagher. He's a coward.,Spurs,Yes,jekcldv,t1_jekbm3t

I'm sorry but Brighton never played this well under Potter.

Spurs and Poch in 2015 suited each other perfectly.

Getting a new manager and a DoF at the same time is very difficult. You need those 2 people compatible with each other and willing to work together. And they need to be compatible with the club‚Äôs vision and environment.

>	¬£200M loan army could be a blessing if the new manager thinks they‚Äôre good/can actually use them.

Even if that were to happen(big IF), then we still need to sell a lot of players from the current squad as we have reached the limits of the squad size.

Other than that the options are gamble‚Äôs that are good in their own leagues and really only proven on smaller scales. 

I get they have to step up at sometime but we simply don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôll turn out for us. Like people here live Slot  cause he‚Äôs doing really well at Feyenoord which fair enough but Frank De Boer was also an incredible manager and touted to be one of the best in the world and ended up being awful in the prem and one of the shortest tenures in the history of the prem.

"eze and olise were huge misses. I'm not quite sure he wanted Bowen. Skriniar was a Jose signing and Dybala and Bruno were big names so not that impressive in terms of scouting.

"maybe long term we would have been better, but we would never be in the top 4 race under Potter. Just like the step up to Chelsea was too early, the step up to Tottenham would be too early as well. De Zerbi is simply the better manager right now and it is clear to see.
