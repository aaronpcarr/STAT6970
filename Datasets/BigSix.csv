"Just watched the extended highlights so obviously i dont have a complete picture on the game, but weirdly has made me feel better. My takeaways: 

- Saka continues to show how good he is. Seemed like our player who most looked like scoring. 
- We weren't at the races at all, weren't pressing like we normally do, weren't stopping crosses, let our man get away from us far too many times in the box which led to their goal. I don't blame √òdegaard for it because he's just been outmuscled by a strong CB and there needed to be someone else on marking duties. Not sure if tiredness or a mentality thing, but Everton showed way more fight.
- Everton deserve credit, probably deserved to win by more rather than us deserving a draw. 
- Arteta will be very disappointed at the duels we lost.
- We seemed uncharacteristically flustered in possession.

Fielding a team of physical players and slogging it out with them is exactly what they want; it would be playing not only their football on their terms, but into their hands. At that point, you're no longer even trying to wrestle a pig, you're just LARPing as a pig in a fight with an animal who was born that way.

Even on a case-by-case basis, it doesn't make sense. Think of the players we put out who are routinely praised for their physicality.

"Everton took a couple of lessons off of Newcastle.  First, 5 across the midfield during our build up, which makes Zinchenko's invert easier to deal with.  Second, doubling every winger because we play to feet so often with our wide players.   In both games we weren't able to create an advantage out of the double.  

Zinchenko is an important player in this team, but in these situations I think KT is more helpful.  Our wingers are isolated by design, but Saka has more support from Odegaard.  Xhaka does a lot of things well, but supporting a winger is not one of them.  Also, when a team is sitting in a 4-5-1, I'd like to see 5 attacking players across the opposing back 4 and play the long ball from time to time.  Part of the logic in that block is that Arsenal will retain a stubborn adherence to principle.  Gabi should beat Coleman in a footrace, but we never gave him the chance to run on to the ball.  

When the midfield is running well, my maybe we continue and breakdown Everton, but each of our midfield 3 was uncharacteristically off it.  White also was just not with the program - similar to Newcastle.  

I liked how Arteta dipped into the bench and showed confidence in Vieira - the player needs that and the team needs him as a contributing member.  Probably just walking a well worn path against a familiar foe, but if you aren't taking Zina off to change the left side, you have to take Xhaka off.  It's a shame ESR isn't fit, and there's no sign of that happening for a while.

Wash our hands of it and rebound.  How the team reacts to this game is now wayyy more important than what happened in the game.",Arsenal,No,j7axc2z,t3_10u7b9u

I can't put all the faults of Gabby missing, but he does drift wide and help Gabi out a lot. With Zinny inverting like he is and Xhaka not really overlapping a lot, Gabi is left 1v1 or 1v2 most of the time and it isn't helping him.",Arsenal,No,j7csxfl,t3_10u7b9u

- There are no easy games in the PL
- I think we got too cocky about the title. These are games which can determine title races.
- Everton are full of individual quality. Just lacked a competent manager
- Midfield needs to be play better
- WTH are we doing during set pieces?
- We should absolutely consider starting Tomi and Trossard. Their competitors have been very poor in recent games
- New manager bounce is a reality. It has happened many, many times in recent years at least within the PL

"The Martinelli ""not getting support"" thing. Don't forget that when our whole team is tilted towards Saka's wing, so is Everton's entire defensive shape. So Martinelli is almost freed up to recieve the big switch ball. Something which happened a few times and Gabi didn't take full advantage of it.

It might be by design and maybe even the rest of the squad didn't do enough to switch the ball to Gabi more often, so he can be more dangerous. 

That picture doesn't convey the whole story.",Arsenal,No,j7airvb,t3_10u7b9u

If even casual fans can guess he is just going to the corner, then do you think he stand a chance against professional footballers who study how to stop him. It just used to work before, everyone just figured it out now. He needs to add more variety to his game. 

Also, the team might lean right, but that is actually a good thing for Gabi. He has more space to dribble. Imagine if saka has more space on right, he would be balling there.

We have Tomiyasu who is far better going forward on the overlap for Saka than White, although he may be a bit less techincally able. 

We have Tierney who can provide more traditional LB play to overlap with the LW. Tierney starting will balance out the lopsided attack which is causing problems attacking down the LW.

We have Trossard who may be a better playmaker than Gabi. Gabi has had a tough time with his decision making recently. He often runs the ball out for a goal kick, or doesn't know what to do once he gets into the box. 

Starting the same 11 every game makes us predictable and teams will start to figure us out. Yesterday should be a wakeup call that we can't win them all if we play the same way every game. We're not untouchable in our system. It works 80% of the time, but when it doesn't, or perhaps more importantly, when Arteta *thinks* it may not work, we have to have a bit of flexibility.

"I'm usually an optimistic person so sorry in advance for the doom & gloom.

To me, this Everton game was a game bigger than most, it was the yardstick with which to judge if this team can actually go the distance, it would tell us more than Man Utd or Spurs imo and this is why:

* The narrative was easy for the players and the manager to understand. We've struggled at Goodison in the past, we've struggled at stadiums when the crowd gets going, we've struggled against low-block teams and we've struggled against teams that want a physical game, that's the stereotype at least. This game was a banana skin for us to all outsiders, much more than any other non-top 6 game this season. They knew and we knew exactly what does game would be like, the players and the manager knew for certain. BUT we still made the same mistake we made against Southampton this season, and against others last season. It's okay to lose when you're outplayed, that wouldn't mean much to us now, but yesterday we were outfought. We weren't up for the battle.

* The focus was on the Man City game for us, for the neutrals and for the media. I'm certain it was the same for the club too (no matter how much they repeat the ""game at a time"" mantra). Again, in these big games, it's about controlling the narrative. We go in to that game with a 5pt lead and a game in hand, ALL the pressure is on City to come to the Emirates and win. They HAVE to win. That puts us in such an advantageous position. Now the whole narrative has flipped, if they win their games (as is expected) and we had just one small blip, we'll be a 2 points ahead of them (game in hand won't matter anymore to the media and others) so the focus and narrative in that game now will be can Arsenal avoid dropping into 2nd, the pressure from the outside has shifted.

* Man City are struggling this season in their dressing room, at a key turning point for them, we've unfortunately dropped points which I fear will rejuvenate and motivate their players now, give them a believe at a key stage that they can overcome us, even if they're underperforming.

To end on a more positive note, we were always the underdogs this season and the players have shown that they can overcome extremely difficult obstacles already, even if we've made things more difficult for ourselves. Let's go on a run and see what things look like again in a few weeks.",Arsenal,No,j7ajsun,t3_10u7b9u

"""Martinelli not getting support"" is not true or the reason he's been trash for weeks

Martinelli right now is Pepe except if Pepe always tried to run to the byline instead of always trying to cut inside

When defenders know you are no threat in one of the directions, they can cheat and take an extra yard in the direction they'll know you go, so you can't even rely on being faster than them to beat them

Until Martinelli becomes a cut inside threat, he will continue to lose all of his full back duels. The only games where this doesn't apply are when there are spaces to play the ball in behind the defence, which for us are few and far between

He is a pure pace and power winger right now and it is not fun to watch at all. Trossard probably starts next game 

In terms of the rest of our season, the game plan to nullify us is obvious - 4-5-1 with 3 big athletic runners who can back up full backs with the wide midfielders and still press the whole game. We don't have the personnel to beat it atm. Joelinton-Guimares-Willock and Gueye-Onana-Doucoure. How many other teams have a midfield 3 like that? If the answer is ""none"" we're fine",Arsenal,No,j7aler8,t3_10u7b9u
"i just have these questions about our signings if we're not going to use them. everton had fifteen points before this game & we knew they'd be hard to break down, so why not try trossard and vieira in place of martinelli & xhaka on the left? we couldn't account for things like the team generally not playing well, but vieira and trossard offer a lot more when it comes to tooling a defense. people might say vieira ode partey is a risk, but come on, they had fiftteen points; you can't trust your players to play these games, why did you even get them in the first place? 

arteta's always been a bit inflexible, and it was fine when we didn't have a fuller squad, but at times it's just gonna cost us and it happened yesterday. case in point, tomiyasu with two strong showings can't get a start despite ben white being off recently. not sure what the thinking is behind that. arteta needs to start modifying the game plan just a little bit to compensate for the different strengths of different players. 

that being said, we were bound to lose a game. if we win fifteen of the next seventeen, we'll get over ninety points; our toughest games will be the city fixutures, but i truly believe we can still do it. all it takes is a bounce back against brentford, which we are more than capable of.

Sunday dinner really hitting different in this one‚Äôs household. Levels,Arsenal,Yes,j7cb9tg,t1_j7cad0k
"This is why we need Jesus back asap. He really commands a lot of attention from defenders with his movement when he is on the pitch and frees up Martinelli and Saka. As Arteta himself said previously, Jesus ""causes chaos"".",Arsenal,Yes,j7ch8jt,t1_j7cghec
"I'm all for teams playing a back 6 and hoping to try and beat us by scoring off a corner.

It's not some genius strategy.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ci7dv,t1_j7cghec
He got a knee injury.,Arsenal,Yes,j7cuiuz,t1_j7cqard
"Spurs couldn't generate the same aggressive physical pressure on our midfielders. That's the ticket, along with a good block and doubling up on Saka. Physically, Spurs don't have the likes of Bruno/Longstaff/Willock/Joelinton or Onana/Gana/Doucoure, and unlike Everton and Newcastle they didn't try to match our numbers in the middle.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cuu55,t1_j7ctcyg
"We make fun of Spurs playing a back 5, but they still had 2 or 3 players higher than Everton, who only ever had DCL.

Lloris also made the mistake early so they had to open up.

If we score early on Everton it's not a close game.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cu8ru,t1_j7ctcyg
"Leeds as well - we seem to struggle a bit against tough, hard pressing physical teams. We don‚Äôt have a huge physical presence in the middle of the field, √ò for example can be a bit lightweight at times. 

*I know leeds are crap but they were very good against us.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cy336,t1_j7ctcyg
spurs played 2 man midfield and are usually defending from very deep,Arsenal,Yes,j7d2ley,t1_j7ctcyg
Because Spurs aren't as well drilled and they play wingbacks meaning they can't use wingers and fullbacks to double up on our wingers like Everton did so well,Arsenal,Yes,j7d6d86,t1_j7ctcyg
Liverpool fans claiming this is a weak season makes them look worse‚Ä¶. Do they know this?,Arsenal,Yes,j7d81g6,t1_j7d5jd7
"Can't believe the Man U fantasies. They are much much better under ETH but they're still miles off us and city. Add to that of their two transformative midfielders, one is out for the season and the other has a 3 match ban, I don't see them coping too well with that.",Arsenal,Yes,j7d8a7y,t1_j7d5jd7
Imo Man Utd were never outta the title race anyway. One result doesn't change it that much. Don't think they'll win it but they'll be up there in the last 2-3 games of the season I think,Arsenal,Yes,j7d9ror,t1_j7d5jd7

"While you make some decent points, I don't fully agree.

There must be a reason why Arteta decided to bring on Fabio for Odegaard and not Xhaka, even though both Odegaard and Xhaka had a bellow average performance. Physicality is not everything, but it is important.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aujnt,t1_j7arzd1
"They were pressing man to man in the first half, how do you avoid the battle.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ati0m,t1_j7arzd1

I think we just need that extra bit of quality in our forward line.,Arsenal,Yes,j7aso38,t1_j7arzd1
Yeah but we need to actually win the title for it to even be the start of a cycle,Arsenal,Yes,j7achyr,t1_j7ac1qs
A stadium we haven't won in 5 years + Sean Dyche + new manager bounce,Arsenal,Yes,j7ae8pb,t1_j7ae686
"Think the big disappointment for me is it slightly negates the great win vs United because we could have swapped the results and been in the same position.

But it doesn't have to be any more than that. We were miles off it, wasn't our day. They were totally fired up. And that's it, we move on.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ahta5,t1_j7ahaea
We should try tierney lb zinny 8,Arsenal,Yes,j7b1805,t1_j7axc2z
"To be fair, Dyche has played this way for years and it was to be expected.

I think most of us knew that this game would be a battle, especially in Goodison. What's disappointing is that the team would have been aware of what was in store for us and yet we couldn't do anything about it 

Tactically we need to improve in these type of games because we'll be seeing more of them now that we're at the top.

Agree that we should use this game to improve our game and look for a reaction against Brentford. A good result there will set us up nicely for the City game, which will be massive",Arsenal,Yes,j7azp1k,t1_j7axc2z
"Tomi needs to be starting at RB against teams with fast/physical attackers

"It's a tough one because we did need an overlapper, yet Zinchenko was our best passer. Maybe Tomi earlier for White, though that's not really his strength either.",Arsenal,Yes,j7b123t,t1_j7axc2z
When we win vs Brentford it‚Äôll be back to overwhelmingly positive.,Arsenal,Yes,j7b4oxf,t1_j7b4cyz

"Saka still doing bits so I don‚Äôt think this is the case tbh. Also, Xhaka does drift to the left side a lot ‚Äî who assisted the cross to Eddie‚Äôs first goal vs Manure? Xhaka from the left wing.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cv1y9,t1_j7csxfl
Exactly - it‚Äôs the dynamics. It‚Äôs not the player.,Arsenal,Yes,j7d6af1,t1_j7csxfl
"I would argue we sagged notably when Thomas came off, and Everton looked a lot more comfortable from then on-- and I've been arguing that Jorginho was shrewd business from the first.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aqty1,t1_j7anru2

"We don't even need 'someone more defensively sound than Odegaard'; if Arteta had an √òdegaard clone, we'd be playing and enjoying both of them across the top of our midfield.

It's such a clear area of need.",Arsenal,Yes,j7bmz48,t1_j7bk6lq
"I don't understand how anyone can put any faith in them after last time. If we want to win, then we pick ourselves up and do it ourselves.",Arsenal,Yes,j7bnf2i,t1_j7bmfpm

Our schedule also looks easy but we have more anxiety because we care more about us,Arsenal,Yes,j7crun3,t1_j7cpezl
"Not really. They have plenty of really tough fixtures ahead. Spurs, Newcastle, Chelsea, Liverpool and Brighton away and they end the season against a bunch of team‚Äôs that will be clawing their way out of relegation. Also, their best player just got banned for 3 matches, they‚Äôll drop points at some point",Arsenal,Yes,j7crxes,t1_j7cpezl
Well they play 8 matches over the next month and we only have 5. Should be interesting to see how they cope with many midweek fixtures.,Arsenal,Yes,j7cv3hj,t1_j7cpezl
"It probably should be opponent based.

Vs United we had absolutely no issue moving the ball up and getting shots with our usual setup.

Vs Everton we did.

I think its fair to say Mikel made a mistake not trying to change our shape vs Everton.",Arsenal,Yes,j7dgwss,t1_j7dfn20
"But, but, Giroud is one of the greatest strikers of his generation!!!

The fact that he would go on huge goalless droughts for Arsenal and couldn‚Äôt be counted on to consistently score even the clearest of sitters is the fault of the players around him, and that he had no backup!!! It was never his fault!!!

He was world-class, and we didn‚Äôt appreciate him enough!!!

\\s

Yeah, I don‚Äôt think so.

Giroud wasn‚Äòt a total scrub, but he‚Äôs gotten waaaaaay the hell overrated by the revisionist history merchants on here. He‚Äôs the definition of good on his day, but never great on any day (let alone world class lol).",Arsenal,Yes,j7d25qq,t1_j7cw2iy
"What a joke from the mods. I remember the threads in there when we lost against United earlier this season, doubt they gave out many bans despite hundreds of similar comments.",Arsenal,Yes,j7c9gwy,t1_j7c90yq
"They changed the rules tbf

"The mods there are brainless bums, dont be too bothered about it. You will always have a home, and it is here.",Arsenal,Yes,j7casfl,t1_j7c90yq
You act like it‚Äôs something new? There is always an agenda and double-standard when it involves us ‚Äî both negatively and positively.,Arsenal,Yes,j7ca4bn,t1_j7c90yq
"I like this.

Next weekend I‚Äôm hoping we do the business and get ahead start on City that play late on the Sunday. With our game being at home - should be a nice advantage.

Get ahead early next week and hopefully get the team mentally and physically ready. Could be a challenge though as Brentford are the inform team.",Arsenal,Yes,j7d6z30,t1_j7d49bc
He was right though. He saw Maupay was holding his head when there was no head contact. I was confused until I saw the replay and realised it was actually really good reffing. Wish they did it more often - players defend timewaste by taking advantage of that rule.,Arsenal,Yes,j7admh1,t1_j7adbw2
"Haha, I felt a little unwell reading this.",Arsenal,Yes,j7bq5bv,t1_j7bq23a
I think 3+ and no injuries will doing it honestly. Once they get into the CL which pep is obsessed with I can see them lose focus in some games.,Arsenal,Yes,j7cfeej,t1_j7ce7il
"Worst part is, if they win, we‚Äôre gonna sit and agonise over the 11 point lead we could‚Äôve had. I‚Äôll still take the potential for 8 points, though. Come on, Sp*rs.",Arsenal,Yes,j7as212,t1_j7arac7
He is not injured. Arteta just wanted to play with Jorginho...,Arsenal,Yes,j7av9j8,t1_j7auznd

Not to mention their kits are consistently awful,Arsenal,Yes,j7c17z9,t1_j7c12sl
"It makes sense why a lot of Americans support them. Spurs always seen as a smaller club but have big club potential. Those people want to pick a team that's not too good or too shit, they want in the middle. Works both ways with Brits and American sports.",Arsenal,Yes,j7c4cxg,t1_j7c12sl

"Right there with us and City. Might need a bit more depth but with added PL money it would be addressed. 

Took them to win the CL at 14/1 and it's down to 11 now.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cnel7,t1_j7cn23k
"yea the problem is if its not birghton, its gonna be someone who we dont want there. And while Brighton could do it, I don't feel its all that likely (although 538 has it around 28%). 

Brighton getting in would be lovely, both for us and in general it would be a great story.",Arsenal,Yes,j7df5uh,t1_j7dco4g
"they will strengthen even if they miss on UCL (I think they will finish in top4, they play really good now), just look at Chelsea spending, nothing will happen in case they miss out on UCL. But would be great for us if they go to EL",Arsenal,Yes,j7dhcdo,t1_j7dco4g
"I feel the same way, Tottenham might as well get in there because they still have that debt from the new stadium they'd have to worry about. Just in this decade they will fall off because they won't be able to match Manchester United's commercial revenue or Chelsea's warchest.

Meanwhile United would get a possible +¬£80 mil, which if they had it this season, they could have possibly brought in someone other than Wout Weghorst this season. Who knows, with that extra cash, they might have been the one with Felix, not Chelsea.",Arsenal,Yes,j7dm39q,t1_j7dco4g
Yes. Anything less than a City win makes the weekend a lot less bad for us.,Arsenal,Yes,j7ad5vc,t1_j7ad1te
"Me too. It‚Äôs just the inevitability of it that gets me, and there was nothing we could do to stop it. The narrative, the script, went EXACTLY as I feared and it‚Äôs frustrating watching it unfurl in front of your sorrowful eyes üò≠",Arsenal,Yes,j7anv08,t1_j7alhhb
"I was about to type this exact comment lol it didn't feel bad yesterday but looking back on it it's quite a shameful loss especially with that ""Dyche is ard"" nonsense",Arsenal,Yes,j7amxdy,t1_j7alhhb
"I agree, or even try Trossard there. The two games we've had recently against defensively organised teams Newcastle and Everton there were moments where quicker decision making and movements were needed in that position.

 I just think Xhaka can sometimes be too slow to turn and the chance is cut out, or it gives time for the defending team to get back in their shape",Arsenal,Yes,j7bib3r,t1_j7bhkxo
"I agree. Pep has just started away from home against a top 6 opposition playing silva and alvarez on the middle with Lewis inverting

Xhaka has been brilliant in the first half of the season (and he will have his uses going foward) but this is the next stage of evolution imo",Arsenal,Yes,j7bpvge,t1_j7bhkxo
"I think the bigger difference isn't skill but the fact the Saka isn't as isolated as Martinelli is. Look at the heatmap from yesterday's game, super right leaning. Plus, Saka has √ñdegaard and White next to him who has been like the teams best players (disregarding the last games) this season.",Arsenal,Yes,j7bv8lp,t1_j7bu0ta
I love Zina and his ability to play as an inverted full back but it really makes him very 1 dimensional and easier to delegate if he doesn't overlap at all in games.,Arsenal,Yes,j7buiyl,t1_j7bu0ta
"Martinelli needs to improve in that aspect or he needs to be replaced. Trossards first touch, decision making, and chance creation has not been a problem in the little minutes he's seen in the team.",Arsenal,Yes,j7bv8hk,t1_j7bu0ta
I think the key to Martinelli getting more into games is ESR playing and in form.,Arsenal,Yes,j7c3ncn,t1_j7bu0ta
"who cares

stop lurking their sub and reporting back. Happens so much in this thread",Arsenal,Yes,j7c8tq2,t1_j7c8je6
"Your right! Not one player didn‚Äôt anything particularly wrong, we were just of the pace as a team, it happens we move on, still 5 points clear imagine saying that at the beginning of the season lol",Arsenal,Yes,j7aikhu,t1_j7ai5za
"We should've went in for him in last summer, 30M is a bargain in todays market.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ax9cb,t1_j7avhjz
I didn‚Äôt want him and still don‚Äôt. He completed 24 passes the whole game. It‚Äôs one thing being a midfield destroyer in a team that values broken play and regaining the ball into space and another thing completely to do the things we ask partey to do.,Arsenal,Yes,j7axzpw,t1_j7avhjz
"He did. I watched the first half of that game and Rice was amazing. He and Paqueta completely controlled the midfield and the Hammers defence was really solid. I don‚Äôt expect them to have a bad second half of the season, but we should be all in for Rice this summer.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ajm23,t1_j7agb9l
"If we were 8 points behind right now and the top team had a game In hand, I doubt those same people would be saying we're in the title race. Mad how interested some Arsenal fans are in trying to create a 3 horse title race.

Personally hope everyone bigs up United now so we can laugh when they collapse again",Arsenal,Yes,j7ci9c1,t1_j7cflz0
Man U are as much of a threat as city.... whoop whoop whoop!,Arsenal,Yes,j7cg4ul,t1_j7cflz0
"Man utd are in it, the season is unpredictable and they have a good squad and form.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cjkl4,t1_j7cflz0
"The set pieces defending was shocking yesterday, every corner they got felt like a penalty",Arsenal,Yes,j7ak9cp,t1_j7ac526
"Agree. That's two poor matches in a row from White. Not gonna hammer the guy, he's been great most of the season. But in a competitive top level team when you do that, the guy behind you gets his chance, and if he steps up he keeps the shirt until such time as he loses it.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ahpqt,t1_j7ahhal
"Christ almighty of all the shit takes I‚Äôm actually surprised this one has reappeared. 

Well done. You have actually done something original in the shit take arena that is the daily discussion.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ait2k,t1_j7ahhal
White is a better overlapper than Tomiyasu.,Arsenal,Yes,j7arvlq,t1_j7ahhal
"It's not a physiciality issue. Spurs and Brentford didn't cause us problems this season.

They both played a 4-5-1 shape and doubled up on Saka and Martinelli. Our only real central creative threat is Odegaard. Martinelli didn't really receive much support creatively or movement wise.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aqr5h,t1_j7am00a
"Teams that don't want to play football are always a weakness for teams that want to play football if the ref is one who let's things go. Simple as. It's too easy to just smash someone and kick the ball away, then feign injury. Everton would have been happy with a draw.",Arsenal,Yes,j7amj57,t1_j7am00a
">Are physical teams a big weakness for us?

no other wise we'd have lost or drawn to more of them.  Expertly organised low blocks and lokonga are the weaknesses.",Arsenal,Yes,j7anuww,t1_j7am00a
It's why I rather we get Caicedo and Rice instead of another silky 8 for aesthetics. Modern football loves players that grind.,Arsenal,Yes,j7ap7h3,t1_j7am00a
We have a bad habit of loosing drawable games yeah we may regret this if it's this close,Arsenal,Yes,j7b3pex,t1_j7b157x
"It's Osimhen or no one in that case but we don't really need to blow 100m on a striker when we have 3 perfectly good ones already.

We need to use the whole budget on midfielders in the summer.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aj1wj,t1_j7agjfl
"While good, caicedo is not the saviour you think he is - he is not Partey 2.0, he's not on that level yet",Arsenal,Yes,j7ajhxw,t1_j7aj62d

It‚Äôs not zinchenko a fault it‚Äôs because Eddie is one dimensional and struggles to drop deep,Arsenal,Yes,j7blso1,t1_j7bkkjt
Doesn't mean you played badly but... we still did yesterday imo. Everton executed their plan way better and even when we had possession we didn't perform.,Arsenal,Yes,j7ct2rk,t1_j7cp3jj
Good take.,Arsenal,Yes,j7cqcco,t1_j7cp3jj
"You need physical midfielders or highly technical midfielders, nothing else",Arsenal,Yes,j7amr9i,t1_j7ambut
"At home it‚Äôs not such of an issue. I think we‚Äôll cope with Brentford (I don‚Äôt underestimate them though!). Away from home I totally agree, we need a plan B",Arsenal,Yes,j7annwl,t1_j7ambut
He‚Äôs really fallen off. If he weren‚Äôt a Spud I‚Äôd be bummed,Arsenal,Yes,j7c2aqh,t1_j7c22so
Sharpest downfall of any recent top player. Even Salah is having a better year,Arsenal,Yes,j7c2cwq,t1_j7c22so
Where is Alvarez going?,Arsenal,Yes,j7c9nm7,t1_j7c2ttt
"That opens the door for commercials, I think they just need to add more extra time",Arsenal,Yes,j7c4m1m,t1_j7c3zf0
It will be so funny when they go away to Leicester on Saturday and get smashed.,Arsenal,Yes,j7cbcw6,t1_j7c8zsp

"No. Injury riddled season with less goals and way less expected goals than Eddie. ¬£80m for a player with better ball striking but not much else better than Eddie.

There is also a very real possibility all Juve players get suspended for their personal involvement.",Arsenal,Yes,j7dhweh,t1_j7dhct5
"hell no! what a bullet dodged if he joined id have stopped supporting arsenal, hate him like xhaka does",Arsenal,Yes,j7dk6hp,t1_j7dhct5
Rather go for Osimhen or Goncalo Ramos if we do need to buy,Arsenal,Yes,j7dje37,t1_j7dhct5
Avoid Juve players getting suspended,Arsenal,Yes,j7dm5mq,t1_j7dhct5
"Yes. If we add him he's instantly the second best striker in the league behind Haaland. He's a complete forward. There's a reason he was 1a to Jesus' 1b. He offers something different to our striking options. 

But I would say before I look into Vlahovic I'd be examining Locatelli and Kulusevski as possibilities first. Just simply higher priorities as Jesus/Nketiah are already very good options.",Arsenal,Yes,j7dmbxj,t1_j7dhct5
"Odegaard, Zinchenko and Partey all had shockers against Everton and they‚Äôre the ones who need to have a real look at what they contributed to here.  

It‚Äôs just easy and apparently popular to blame Martinelli (there‚Äôs even a guy claiming Ben white was poor down below lol). 

This sub just goes on whomever is the east target. There‚Äôs no real analysis.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ajzk3,t1_j7airvb
"Interesting. Was watching the game on Bein and could hear Arteta shout Gabi multiple times. 

Maybe he expected more from him when there was a lot of space to be exploited.",Arsenal,Yes,j7an5i8,t1_j7airvb

"He is struggling because the dynamics around him suck. He just ends up doubled teamed - contrary to what he heatmap implies about him having more space to operate. Zinchenko and Xhaka are too stiff blud.

"Nah Kane will be remembered. England captain, potential PL all time top scorer. But he will always be noted as winning 0 club trophies",Arsenal,Yes,j7d003o,t1_j7cwzyj
"Yea no he isn't, he's going to finish as England's top scorer by a good amount probably, and I think he'll go to a bigger club (UTD) to try and win a title. I also think England have as good of a chance to win the Euros as any other country so he's still got an opportunity to increase his historical standing. It is okay to admit other players are good, even if they play for Spurs.",Arsenal,Yes,j7d02qu,t1_j7cwzyj

"I‚Äôve personally seen mostly top-six fans rooting against us. Have seen quite a few non-EPL and mid table fans on r/soccer saying they want us to win.

I mean, if it was between Chelsea/Spurs and City, wouldn‚Äôt you want City to win? As opposed to a Madrid or Crystal Palace fan, who just want things to be different and exciting.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aw0a5,t1_j7at9h5

"Basically just Man United, Chelsea and Spurs fans. None of them want us to win. They are our 3 biggest rivals, and have been at the front of the queue to banter us during our bad years recently. Now that we are playing amazingly and our London rivals playing like shite, and Man United playing better but still below us, they absolutely seethe it and cannot stand our fans being happy lmao. Wankers the lot of them and it‚Äôs just peak jealousy and bitterness. Liverpool and City fans would rather us win the league than any of that lot, but obviously they are competitive rivals still, City fans obviously want to win the 3 peat title achievement and equalise their biggest rivals. I‚Äôd argue most non big 6 teams fans and non-epl supporters would want us lot to win the PL over any of the other big 6 teams though, probably because of how little success we‚Äôve seen over the last 20 years.",Arsenal,Yes,j7b010l,t1_j7at9h5
"Our online fan base is fucking annoying, as are those of the other big clubs. City has less online presence so their fans don‚Äôt come across as entitled / insufferable.

"I think City is the just too soulless for people to care. So all the other traditional top 4 fans prefer they win. Why? No fans to gloat. Being a fan is bragging rights and you don't want someone with numbers to have them.

"Maybe he does, you never know. That match reminded me of the Wolves match where a moment of magic from Jesus unlocked their backline after 70 mins of nothing. 

And you have to stop taking any sentence that doesn‚Äôt say Eddie is the perfect player personally.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ay8bl,t1_j7awz1p
"We were below the level across the pitch at Leeds too, but got a goal thanks to a moment from Saka. I don't think it's unreasonable to wonder whether Jesus's combination play and dribbling might have helped us unlock something with our wingers doubled up, even if only in one or two decisive moments. It's definitely not a slight to Nketiah to say that some situations call for Jesus's particular skills.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ay0uq,t1_j7awz1p
"To my mind, what would have potentially helped is not one instead of the other for the whole 90, but the change from one to the other, which might have shaken things up-- or even possibly having both on for a time.

Which is more or less exactly what you'd want from two good strikers in a squad.",Arsenal,Yes,j7axdk6,t1_j7awz1p
"Would've been nice to have the option and it highlights just what we're missing with Jesus being injured. Far too many saying that he hasn't been missed too.

Agree that a win seems unlikely but we could've came out with a draw, who knows.

Anyway, he won't be back for sometime and we should really be happy that Eddie has done as well as he has in the meantime. Definitely wouldn't knock him in any way for our team performance yesterday",Arsenal,Yes,j7ayx3u,t1_j7awz1p
"I think yesterday was a perfect game for Jesus though. Away from home in these kind of pressure states he has been huge. 

Even experience & intangibles aside, he offers so much quality dropping deep whilst still getting an absurd amount of touches in the oppo‚Äôs box. Eddie is gaining a lot more confidence in receiving the ball from deep but Jesus is at such a level with it that it has chances to stretch their midfield completely, which I think was the area which stifled us most. 

If even just one of their midfielders has to worry about Odegaard & Jesus, then they‚Äôre in a pickle. Eddie isn‚Äôt quite there in that regard yet, whilst still being a fantastic striker",Arsenal,Yes,j7b1m66,t1_j7awz1p
Jesus absolutely wins us that game lmfao what? Wolves away was the same sort of game as yesterday and he single handedly created our first goal there,Arsenal,Yes,j7bbkht,t1_j7awz1p
"I think the United Vs arsenal matches were good this year. Arsenal Vs Liverpool too (both that and Man United were 3-2 to us so lots of excitement for neutrals). But I get it with Liverpool Chelsea 0-0 recently, Chelsea Man United 0-0.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aih01,t1_j7ai406

"What? If City lose our position is better than it could‚Äôve been, idk about you but I‚Äôm gonna feel some pretty intense relief. It would also bolster the team‚Äôs confidence, I think. City drew Everton at home under Lampard and would have lost to Tottenham, who we did the double over. Proves we can beat them",Arsenal,Yes,j7c1yt6,t1_j7c0mzj

"He has immense physical attributes, the talents there he needs someone who can put it all together - and I think Howe is the right man for it.

"I dont think *flooding* alone does much.

Everton did that while also positioning their wingers close enough that they could shake hands with their full backs.

If you want to play basically a 4-5-1 out of possession, it's so, so tough to get the ball up the pitch and have over 30% possession.

Everton had 27% possession and were fine with that as long as they didn't concede.

That's not a sustainable way to win football matches. 

They worked hard on the day, but if you told me teams were going go park the bus and allow us to have 75% possession I'd sleep easy.",Arsenal,Yes,j7dczs9,t1_j7dc5ww

"I'm not really worried about teams playing 10 or 11 behind the ball and having a full back and a winger deep and effectively playing a back 6.

Subbing Gabi and white makes sense, because our backups seems capable enough to replace them. But if we are chasing a game, how can we replace odegaard with viera and keep xhaka on.

"City finishes below top 4 , he will leave the next day.",Arsenal,Yes,j7c7e2c,t1_j7c6w8s
Some National team perhaps.,Arsenal,Yes,j7c76sy,t1_j7c6w8s
"It's too late now, you can't relocate games at such a short notice

I think our FA cup game was too close to this midweek because we needed it free in case there was a replay against City",Arsenal,Yes,j7cb0vd,t1_j7c7al7
"Newcastle looking really fucked without Guimaraes, is he out for a while? I can‚Äôt see them staying in the top 4 if they play the way they did yesterday without him",Arsenal,Yes,j7aul34,t1_j7ar2jg
"Yeah, Newcastle and Liverpool also dropped points to relegation canditates. It happens every now and then.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aucdp,t1_j7ar2jg
Often it‚Äôs easy to point out these things with hindsight but I tend to agree here. A bit of extra height wouldn‚Äôt have been a bad thing with the amount of balls Everton were putting into the box. Have got to think about Toni‚Äôs excellent stats in aerial duels when it comes to set pieces too.,Arsenal,Yes,j7aok0f,t1_j7an9kw
Three more to draw if we get a repeat performance,Arsenal,Yes,j7bx8e9,t1_j7bwnnx
"Agreed. So far the result is in isolation. We have dropped points against United, Southampton and Newcastle, but they were in isolation - plenty of wins seperated  these matches. 

That‚Äôs why the Brentford game is highly important, because the next match after that is Man City. It‚Äôs one game at a time, but the atmosphere going into the City game will be grim if we have not beat Brentford.

This is where Arteta and the players need to keep focus. Get the team huddles going again and get back to playing with no fear. We were fearless against Man United, but to timid against Everton",Arsenal,Yes,j7ajzw5,t1_j7aj53c
Partey‚Äôs pass competition is like 90% this season why are we making shit up now,Arsenal,Yes,j7apeu5,t1_j7ap0qo
It was heaps worse yesterday. Even ode over hit 4-5.,Arsenal,Yes,j7aq4gw,t1_j7ap0qo
"Well I think it's the simplicity of some of the passes that we're missing that makes it more noticeable. If it was long balls, etc. then that would be understandable, but it seems more basic passes we were hitting earlier are being missed.",Arsenal,Yes,j7arlb1,t1_j7ap0qo
"Of course. Nothing is over until it's over. I hate Arsenal fans acting like we already won the league as much as the doom & gloomers.

Never mind they've not won there for like 5 years now.,Arsenal,Yes,j7c6g1o,t1_j7c641l
"Actually I don't even think it was about overlapping. I wanted more hoofballs over Coleman's head and exploit his lack of pace vs Martinelli but Zinny was too focused on keeping possession and vertical grounded passes.

Saka caused a lot if trouble to Mykolenko when we went more direct and long to him.",Arsenal,Yes,j7agbav,t1_j7afsa5
"That was last season. The dynamic at City is different now. They lost 3 games all last season, they have already lost 4 this year",Arsenal,Yes,j7cfzsw,t1_j7cdfnb
"They aren't favorites. They haven't been favorites since early December. Their is not a single book on earth that would give you this.

If you think they are favorites, you basically have the betting opportunity of the year.

This City team just isnt as good as previous years. Their defense is trash. Walker, Lewis and Ake as full back options is poor.",Arsenal,Yes,j7chmge,t1_j7cdfnb
As mentioned by the other poster. We are the favourites. The bookmakers literally price us the lowest odds to win the league this year,Arsenal,Yes,j7ci8cn,t1_j7cdfnb
The asymmetry is intentional though,Arsenal,Yes,j7djegn,t1_j7ddhex
"Its not over at all lol. We dropped points against Southampton also, and went on a great run after. For some reason we struggle against the worst teams? Maybe its because we get a bit complacent while they feel like they have nothing to lose.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aj07z,t1_j7ada20

Harsh on Gabriel as well.,Arsenal,Yes,j7aeob5,t1_j7ae44p
"White was really, really bad for him. Gave the ball away 4 or 5 times basically unforced. One of his turnovers nearly led to their goal. Seemed to give up on a couple of through balls, didn't impact up the pitch. Not a good day for him.

√òdegaard, Xhaka and Partey were also far off. Thought Eddie had his worst game for us since he came in too, so it certainly wasn't just White. But yeah he wasn't good.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aiixc,t1_j7ae44p
"Big Gabby was good, Eddie was OK, Zinchenko honestly had lots of ball through being the floating extra man but he really didn't do too much with it.",Arsenal,Yes,j7afwyo,t1_j7ae44p

"Dropping only 7 points is very unlikely though. They won't get 96 points, of course.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ctir4,t1_j7c9y4b
Exactly. Thank you. Feel like I‚Äôm going insane with some of these replies lol,Arsenal,Yes,j7aimc2,t1_j7aikfy
"I‚Äôd have to watch the Newcastle ones back but just saying this one wasn‚Äôt. 

If Gabriel had control of the ball it‚Äôs different but this is little more than a 50:50 and you can‚Äôt give a penalty for that.",Arsenal,Yes,j7adsuf,t1_j7adne4
"Yep, teams randomly up their game all the time. They still have very high quality players. All you need is Salah to have a great game suddenly.",Arsenal,Yes,j7allg9,t1_j7alfji
Right? Two goals in 10 minutes. I wouldn‚Äôt even be shocked.,Arsenal,Yes,j7c37cb,t1_j7c34wy
"Sure I guess but if your answer is taking him out the lineup and putting another striker in, then I question that decision. Especially when he offers the best service to said strikers.",Arsenal,Yes,j7c94ic,t1_j7c86vo
"Ah, that‚Äôs unfortunate for him. Happy he‚Äôs not being left out for other reasons though. Hope he recovers soon.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cv81y,t1_j7cuiuz
"Agreed with everything asides them ‚Äòbeing miles behind City‚Äô

‚Ä¶they are literally 3 points/1 win behind City nowüòÖ",Arsenal,Yes,j7db9fa,t1_j7d8a7y
"That's reasonable to consider.

You're arguing that we made a change that preserved physicality (Xhaka) and simply swapped less physical players, bringing in a fresh one for a tired one who'd been slogging away. I'd say that's a potentially sound reading; that could well be what Arteta was trying to do.

That would prompt three questions:

1. Did that change help? i.e. was Vieira more effective than √òdegaard?

2. Was the physical player more effective than the less physical players in the same position (advanced 8), or was he even less effective?

3. How much did those opposing teams care about neutralising that physical player in attack, compared to neutralising those less physical players?",Arsenal,Yes,j7avr0d,t1_j7aujnt
"I don't have an easy answer there, and I don't know that there is one.

What I'm fairly confident about is that trying to outmuscle teams like these is not only a terrible plan, but one that precisely sacrifices our advantages for a weaker version of their strengths, on their terms.

If I had to make a general suggestion, it would be to intensify the way we attack, rather than abandoning it.

More involvement going forward from the fullbacks could help, but I don't think just sending them on the overlap to spam crosses will work. Playing a five-channel attack with one channel the opposing defence can simply ignore is not helping, but our options there are, due to injury and recency, not ideal.

I can say that I'm fairly confident Arteta does have ideas, and that we've already heard some of them.",Arsenal,Yes,j7atzqh,t1_j7ati0m
"They certainly didn't help, but that's too easy an answer.",Arsenal,Yes,j7at1ih,t1_j7asv3h
"Possibly.

I rate Eddie, and I think he's performed admirably, but that was a match where Jesus could have helped, even just as a change; he would have asked different questions of those set defences.

But I do think it's notable that despite all of the attempts to pin our lack of production on the left on Martinelli, Trossard didn't exactly set the world alight either. Everton contained him as well.

The problem, to my mind, is that it's too easy for those teams to stack up against 4 of our 5 attacking channels, and just flat out ignore the fifth.",Arsenal,Yes,j7asywe,t1_j7aso38
That's what Arteta said too. He implied we missed Jesus yesterday,Arsenal,Yes,j7atx5r,t1_j7aso38
Or Zina LB and Trossard at the 8. Or a fit ESR. Or Vieira.,Arsenal,Yes,j7b1u57,t1_j7b1805
"It's almost like we need someone else to be providing that width instead of Zinchenko and Martinelli, or offering real threat in the channel when Martinelli is wide.

If only we had another player on the left side of our attack...",Arsenal,Yes,j7b196z,t1_j7b123t
I think Tomi helps against these doubles because he sits where the double comes from.  He's basically an anchor that allows Ode to play around him.  Maybe it's because he's played as a FB longer and just feels more comfortable in those places.,Arsenal,Yes,j7b21zb,t1_j7b123t
if we won yesterday would the job have been done ?no. so what exactly is ur point?,Arsenal,Yes,j7bcppj,t1_j7bat17
"You can't compare Saka's position with Gabi's. Look at the amount of support Saka has. Xhaka does drift out, but definitely not as much as √òdegaard does. Idk.",Arsenal,Yes,j7cvwno,t1_j7cv1y9
"I think that was more overall fatigue, frustration and growing Everton confidence after the goal than Jorginho. Remember they were more than happy to take a draw here. Going 1-0 up at 60 min was a huge boost to their confidence in play style",Arsenal,Yes,j7ar6o4,t1_j7aqty1
"Well it didn't help that very shortly after we made those two subs, Everton scored. Don't think it was either Jorginho or Trossard's fault for the goal but it was very unfortunate timing",Arsenal,Yes,j7arorq,t1_j7aqty1
"Ehhh the performance was just so poor all round that I don‚Äôt think there was any real noticeable difference, and this is all putting aside whether potential painkillers etc for Partey were starting to wear off a bit too. 

It‚Äôs just easy for people to go after a scapegoat after literally our only 2nd League defeat of the season, and unfortunately it‚Äôs unsurprising given how many idiots are in our fanbase",Arsenal,Yes,j7ar8du,t1_j7aqty1
"We mostly sucked when Thomas was on the pitch too, I think we looked good in the second half until Everton's goal but the first half was terrible.",Arsenal,Yes,j7auum4,t1_j7aqty1
Well don't let me stop you from taking the midnight train going anywhere.,Arsenal,Yes,j7bg8yn,t1_j7bfjak
"Saka has been this season, no?",Arsenal,Yes,j7c4ix8,t1_j7c49lg
Rarely. No way you can book for this one tbh. But the one in the arsenal game was dead on simulation for a penalty. Should be added to VAR that. If you simulate to force a check in VAR and you obviously dive you should get booked by the ref on the pitch,Arsenal,Yes,j7c4kmr,t1_j7c49lg
"Yeah Joelinton just a day ago, but usually only for diving inside the box I feel. Most dives are in the box tho",Arsenal,Yes,j7c4nn9,t1_j7c49lg
"Yeah, Saka does",Arsenal,Yes,j7c4odk,t1_j7c49lg
"I've seen a lot of revisionism over 2015/2016 of late calling that team very good. 

We tried to replace Giroud with Benzema, Higuain, Suarez then signed Lacazette and Aubameyang. 

All of those players minus Lacazette were better than Giroud by a mile.",Arsenal,Yes,j7d2wb4,t1_j7d25qq
"No one's ever called Giroud one of the greatest strikers of his generation.

Not thinking he's an absolute donkey and getting weirdly angry anytime he gets success isn't thinking he's Henry.

"Yeah, I think that‚Äôs why Liverpool is so popular in in the US, too",Arsenal,Yes,j7c6zdn,t1_j7c4cxg
"Yeah I think they would be at the top with us and City as well, but because Serie A is weaker than Premier League they can concentrate on CL too. It's almost impossible trying to go for both PL and CL",Arsenal,Yes,j7coph4,t1_j7cnel7
Nah. Top four dog fight though.,Arsenal,Yes,j7cnwnh,t1_j7cnel7
"Brighton have a little better analytics than either team, but would likely have to win both matchups they have left.

Ben White was poor,Arsenal,Yes,j7alumq,t1_j7ajzk3
"If you mean Jesus, I get it. There is some truth to it.

But any first team winger for arsenal should not be reliant on other players to play well, period. That means we are accommodating him. Do you think saka should be playing well only when odegaarf is playing. Saka plays well regardless who plays with him. We need that kind of attacking players.

Besides martinelli used to do the same thing before too. It just got figured out by the defenders. 

In fact he was even more predictable before. There was a whole time when Gabi sat on the bench under Arteta. Because every time he got the ball he just out his head down and ran full speed with the ball. Under Arteta he learned to add slight variations in speed to keep the defenders guessing, you know stops, then runs again that sort of thing. and that's how he got back into the team. He needs to do that more. I rarely ever see him cut inside. It's just become way too easy to defend him, everyone just knows where he is going.

Compare him to Saka, Saka is completely unpredictable. He might go outside, cut inside, change his speed, run in behind, play one twos. It's a nightmare for defenders.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ay71q,t1_j7awtq5
Just like Tom Finney.,Arsenal,Yes,j7d0vmn,t1_j7d003o
Once I knew dyche was coming in I knew we wouldn‚Äôt win tbh of course everyone else got to face Lampard once except us.,Arsenal,Yes,j7acncf,t1_j7aclbq

Tbh they'd let him leave though. Why keep a who who doesn't want to be there for a season,Arsenal,Yes,j7ckb4m,t1_j7cju7l
"Agreed with that. But I still think the rest of the team would have to execute the game plan significantly better if we wanted to win that game, regardless of who we have up top.",Arsenal,Yes,j7b1209,t1_j7axdk6
An attacking midfielder? Wrong profile completely.,Arsenal,Yes,j7ahe1s,t1_j7aehtq

"no, don‚Äôt care for ligue 1 and half Italian so I will always watch the derby",Arsenal,Yes,j7cnjp1,t1_j7cmry7
"Looking back at the game, we had 3 major problems. Firstly, we were too slow in our build-up which meant we allowed Everton to get into their defensive shape in time and allowed them to setup their press in time. Secondly, we weren't brave enough with the ball, many times their haphazard frantic pressing left spaces wide open but we didn't exploit that and lastly, when we did break through their shape we were soft physically and poor with our touch.

All three factors combined give Everton enough security to see out the game without conceding more than one or two quality chances at best.",Arsenal,Yes,j7dfxsr,t1_j7dczs9
And? Whoever comes out of the two fixtures with the advantage will go on to win the title. Screencap it.,Arsenal,Yes,j7c69un,t1_j7c5wo2
We play the box to box CM as a 6 or play 4-2-3-1 rather than Jorginho who can't run to save his life.,Arsenal,Yes,j7arib2,t1_j7ardr7
"this is actually something i was paying attention to yesterday. there were lots of times where Martinelli was trying to position himself to make a run behind, but no one ever tried a long ball, not sure why...",Arsenal,Yes,j7ci36s,t1_j7chhtk
"Zinchenko should absolutely play every game, but he shouldn‚Äôt always be the LB. Tierney is way too good to rot on the bench.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ao122,t1_j7ankm3
"I disagree - when his inverted position works it‚Äôs beautiful, but when it doesn‚Äôt it‚Äôs really bad case in point that stupid Antony goal for United. Some
games we need to be compact and this need Tierney, other games we need fluidity and need Zinchenko. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with either in my opinion.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aojc7,t1_j7ankm3

"he is a better passer & better playmaker. that's literally just facts. xhaka offered nothing against this defense and vieira has all the tools to dismantle it. that is literally not up for debate, or you didn't watch vieira at porto.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aiaql,t1_j7ai28j
"It was mentioned in the other thread but those posting and pushing carefully curated comps of only Jorginho's positive involvements are being the same as those scapegoating him. If we let go of any agenda either way we can admit he didn't play particularly well when he came on, gave the ball away several times and didn't help us control the game.

That said, it was 30 minutes of football in one game, and we certainly didn't lose because of him. We'll see how he does for us after 5 matches. And even if he isn't any good, if Lokonga has a great loan that's one positive outcome from the transfer.",Arsenal,Yes,j7ai95q,t1_j7agjpi

I despise Ferguson for obvious reasons but what I will always respect is that ability ti create a win at all costs mentiality.

"I observe it all the time because personally I watch games for such tiny things. It's why I sometimes lose it when fans lump on players for the same things their favorites are guilty of. 

Partey is probably our most important player but his passing is average. For a single pivot, it's not okay. Martinelli in the United game in the first 13 minutes was missing passes so bad you'd think he wasn't a PL player. That's why the defence of, 'It's Jesus' absence..' doesn't hold for me. 

But to be fair, the results matter more. It's hard to play an immaculate game. Just that where this team is headed, you need to master the simple stuff.",Arsenal,Yes,j7av2hs,t1_j7arlb1

That's miles difference.",Arsenal,Yes,j7dkr3v,t1_j7db9fa
"I don't think the strategy is ever going to be to outmuscle them. They have three ballwinners and two defensive wingers flanking. 

Our strategy will always be to pass our way round. Ultimately, our passing was too slow and inaccurate, we failed to 'dominate' the game, as Arteta put it. But our players were also not showing for the ball because they were being physically run ragged by the press. 

It's not necessarily about building a team of tall brick houses but about maintaining a base level of strength and athleticism to not feel the brunt of these intense presses. It's about bravery too, but having press resistant players changes that required bravery into assured confidence.

We finished the game with Fabio, Jorginho, Xhaka, Trossard and Zinny on the pitch. All players I like, but in combination you are just left with a weak spine, particularly down the middle of the pitch. Several are agile and speedy in small spaces, or show great stamina over the length of the game, however, they all share some common weaknesses [from a purely athletic perspective].

Yes, everything can still work with good passing rhythm and active movement but when the other team is aggressively tracking and matching our stamina and intensity, you are faced with the ugly truth that we have a midfield that simply folds under too much physical pressure and doesn't quite have the speed nor explosiveness to escape such battles.",Arsenal,Yes,j7aw3bv,t1_j7atzqh

"Not comparing positions directly but more the overall movement and attacking threat from Saka hasn‚Äôt diminished since Jesus‚Äô absence. That‚Äôs my point.

"I'm certainly not saying it was Jorginho's fault we lost, and I would agree that's a pretty idiotic take.

"I don't *simply* mean Jesus, though Jesus' activity did hide a multitude of sins, especially on the left.

No, that would be silly. But √òdegaard creates both a lot of space and a lot of opportunities for Saka; they give each other a lot to work with in attack, and both present problems for opposing defences, both individually and in combination. Their interaction is also part of what allows White to get forward more than Zinchenko.

Now think about what Martinelli is working with on our left.

>  I rarely ever see him cut inside.

If Martinelli comes inside, which I would also like to see him do more, who's offering the width?

In theory, that's *part* of what *should* be happening: the LCM is supposed to alternate with the LW both in providing width and coming inside, as √òdegaard and Saka alternate on the right; the fullback can get involved in that dynamic as well, though their *primary* role is to tuck in next to the 6.

Now compare what's happening on our right to our left. Is one more dynamic, and the other more static? Is Xhaka good at providing width? Do opposing teams worry about him there? Do they worry about him coming inside when Martinelli is wide? Is Zinchenko getting forward to provide width, as you say, or is that happening a lot less than it should?

If you simply replace Martinelli with Trossard, and change nothing else (or nothing else changes circumstantially) you will simply get a different flavour of the same problem.",Arsenal,Yes,j7b4rbz,t1_j7b3ozy

"ben white has been better, but tomiyasu has been struggling with injury since the end of the last season and even went to the world cup with one. he's finally healed and played consistently and has given strong perfromances, so your comment is moot.

"What do you mean precedent. It‚Äôs always been allowed to shift your body weight around the ball to win a 50:50.

"I understand that but if you look at our squad we are in need of a ball winning mid. Hence why we were in for Caicedo. Onana's mobility and ball winning would be useful but also have doubts about his offensive output against low block...we do currently play Xhaka there though so I don't think it would be much worse.

Have actually seen Onana rotate to the wide wing and make half space runs each time he's played - he scored a goal on his debut in this manner if I remember correctly.

Biggest question mark would be passing imo and his movement/understanding of rotations within our positional system.",Arsenal,Yes,j7b9tvo,t1_j7b9a8a

"That's a bit disingenuous. Quoting betting odds forces you to pick a favourite right now. Whereas if you're given three options - Arsenal win, city win, too far away to tell - I imagine the most common pick would be too far away to tell.

"controversial opinions:

martinelli's game has been kinda hit and miss all season, but it's just been masked by the goals. not even having a dig, he's good overall and still has room to improve, but can often kinda not do much all game and then score all of a sudden, but yes of course there are some games where he's quite involved. tactics kinda hang him out to dry a bit though, he's often very isolated


also as tidy as zinny is, he's not doing anything too disimilar to what xhaka would do when he took up those positions, and like xhaka would do at times, he often takes a touch too many and needlessly slows us down. 


the first part of the take on zinny is more frustration with the set up though than with the man himself; I'm more than sure that any team sitting back against us would much rather see our wingback making safe passes as well as the odd line breaker into an akward central area of the pitch than bombing down the wide areas of the pitch and sending in several crosses as well as creating 2v1s or 2v2s (so many 2v1s for saka and martinelli today!) in the wide areas

More teams are gonna play like Everton and Newcastle now. And we need players who okay better against teams that sit back 

Xhaka has been exceptional. He fights for the team. But against teams who sit back, we need a more technical 8, who can also create chances like odegaard. Now it's easier to shut us down by marking odegaard out.

"I'm an Adelaide United fan (hence my flair), we've got a solid core of academy products in our first team but Irankunda is definitely the most promising of the lot. Hopefully he can stay fit and doesn't jump at the first overseas opportunity just to stagnate in a reserve squad like so many of Australia's best talents.",Arsenal,Yes,j767pyj,t1_j765y75

It's disgraceful that we've only worn our best kit (IMO) twice the entire season. I don't think it's eligible in the Europa League and we're out of both cups so the opportunities to wear it are even more limited,Arsenal,Yes,j75uny9,t1_j75u9oi
My day is ruined,Arsenal,Yes,j75uno8,t1_j75u9oi
What are the requirements to be allowed to wear it other than clashing colours? I checked and surely against Leicester away it should be possible no?,Arsenal,Yes,j75xtcs,t1_j75u9oi

Are you still friends with that person.,Arsenal,Yes,j75y73w,t1_j75wrex
They needed him in that midfield with Enzo. Mount and Gallagher ain‚Äôt it,Arsenal,Yes,j75v33c,t1_j75uxli
Jorginho is an excellent signing because now we have a decent Partey backup short term. If Partey is a 9/10 and Sambi is a 5/10 then Jorgingo is at least a 7/10 and that is a huge difference.,Arsenal,Yes,j763fch,t1_j75uxli
"It's telling that the new signings were Chelsea's best players. I don't know why Chelsea fans see that as a positive, give it a week and they will be brought down to Chelsea's level lol. The whole team is turgid",Arsenal,Yes,j75vr2j,t1_j75uxli

"I'm just always going to assume that City will be perfect. Remember 2019? Liverpool were 5 points clear with 14 games left. They only dropped 6 points, but still lost the title.",Arsenal,Yes,j768x2a,t1_j75u21c
"Agreed. His own antics with the Chelsea jersey announcement/ video where the whole family wore it at home; well he had no other option to endear himself to the Chelsea fanbase. 

Especially after his home burglary & jaw being broken. 

It must‚Äôve been so weird to process all that & with Barca throwing him aside to accommodate Lewa.

Again, he‚Äôs a grown man & an adult so his clowing was sad to see; but i can imagine he was just in a funky place mentally",Arsenal,Yes,j75wlxb,t1_j75u40w
"I don't. He was a pretty serviceable player, then became bad after we made him highest paid player in the club's history. We were just recovering from Ozil. We are not Chelsea that doesn't feel the pinch of wages. 

Then he goes to Barcelona and starts playing like he cares.",Arsenal,Yes,j75x23n,t1_j75u40w

"I love reading Pessi and Penaldo just because of how rattled their fanboys get at such a basic insult.

Even funnier when it's accompanied by a ridiculously stupid story like ""I was just about to sign the contract to save the local orphanage, only for Penaldo to barge in and steal the pen for himself, just so he could statpad even more. Shame on you Penaldo!""",Arsenal,Yes,j75y5f8,t1_j75ue2a

Rashford's current form will single handedly earn them a lot of points,Arsenal,Yes,j75ynps,t1_j75y0wb
Rashford tweaks his hammy or drops form and it's over for them to be honest. They'll be delighted with top four and a carabao cup if they win it.,Arsenal,Yes,j760qlc,t1_j75y0wb

"Yeah plenty here will get irrationally upset if Spurs don't take points off City, it's sad to see.

If we want to talk about winning the league then we need to first of all beat City in the Emirates",Arsenal,Yes,j77k05p,t1_j77i10k
I cannot believe i will be rooting for that lot. But i will be and it is gonna be a massive game. Not expecting anything though. They are complete dross throughout 45 minutes of every game.,Arsenal,Yes,j77lum3,t1_j77i10k
Selling Jesus was said in some comments tooüôÉüôÉ,Arsenal,Yes,j7883mc,t1_j782ppx
"We certainly do. The guy is immense everywhere on the pitch especially in build up play. Outstanding defensively as well. He just creates chance after chance and it is what we are severely missing recently, games like today and the Newcastle game are perfect examples. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love Eddie, but he‚Äôs just that typical box striker who is great at scoring goals and we can rely on him for that, but he doesn‚Äôt get involved all over the pitch like GJ does so we create less chances than we normally would. Anyways, he‚Äôs injured for now and there‚Äôs nothing we can do about it. The guy will be like a new signing when he comes back, ready to tear defences down again.",Arsenal,Yes,j784bom,t1_j782ppx
"Lol @back up winger. I say this without fear that Jesus would be our best winger if he accepted the role.  And yes, he'd still wreck the same havoc‚Äî even way more dangerous because he's way better 1v1, can deliver a cross and so many other technical advantages he has over the first XI wingers. 

It's no biggie really. We still keep his tools, while also having a striker that finishes his moves.",Arsenal,Yes,j78igtt,t1_j782ppx
"I hate Spurs because I'm an Arsenal fan.

I hate Man U because I'm a football fan.

I hate Chelsea because I'm human",Arsenal,Yes,j75vswn,t1_j75viho
"I find Chelsea dull and not interesting really. They are like City. At least City have an exciting brand of football and can give one a tactical lesson. Chelsea are soulless. Gather a bunch of stars, then hope for the best. I know almost no one serious to banter with when Chelsea lose. And even if they win, if you have billions pumped into the squad with squad turnovers every 2 years, you're supposed to win. I once lurked their sub and found a couple of them calling their board(s) unserious. Deluded. 

""We won a game!"" Well, the team you just played costs what your one player costs. 


I however hate United. Pure rage when something goes right for them.",Arsenal,Yes,j75w1a1,t1_j75viho
"He's presumably dumping Auba and Havertz for next summer's big striker signing, Ziyech was supposed to be gone but they fucked it and you feel Sterling might get moved on, while Felix is gone at the end of the season anyway.",Arsenal,Yes,j75y8kj,t1_j75y26i
"U forgot to mention players out on loan, ex Lukaku is ‚Ç¨100m sitting on their book.",Arsenal,Yes,j75zn9q,t1_j75y26i
You wait for them to injure eachother in training and play the surviving ones.,Arsenal,Yes,j75z9uh,t1_j75y26i
"That's not even counting the fact that they have Lukaku and CHO out on loan, bought Omari Hutchinson in the summer with the promise of a path to the first team (lmao) and Nkunku is joining in the summer too. Apparently they want to make Felix permanent too. 15 players.",Arsenal,Yes,j760dr8,t1_j75y26i
"And still no good 9.

It's actually laughable how poor the squad planning there is.",Arsenal,Yes,j760n76,t1_j75y26i
Why does Mudryk have goals in him?,Arsenal,Yes,j75y7ij,t1_j75y26i
"Auba, Havertz, Pulisic, Ziyech are obviously not in the plans. Probably Broja too but he's gonna be out for a while so they can't sell. Then Felix is only a loan and he'll be back to Atletico next season. Mount is playing midfield he's not exactly fighting for the forward spots.",Arsenal,Yes,j75yx9a,t1_j75y26i
Its gonna be a toxic dressing room this season for sure. The plan is probably to have a 'survival of the fittest' half season and then offload those that dont survive in the summer.,Arsenal,Yes,j75zdn4,t1_j75y26i
">thinking

He isn't.",Arsenal,Yes,j75zmvg,t1_j75y26i
"They just need 6 so I believe 5 will leave or be counted as midfielders. Like Mount. 

So Auba, Pulisic, Ziyech and Broja might leave. They'll buy a box striker.",Arsenal,Yes,j7638ep,t1_j75y26i
"He'll offload the ones he doesn't want, either loans for the young ones or sales for the old ones. And he'll probably try to buy more. 

He just needs 4 or 5 to hit and he'll be sorted and can just write off the rest or even sell for profit. 

No Europe will add more pressure on the squad and financially on the club so it's something we should be hoping for but they could fail to qualify and still be totally fine too.",Arsenal,Yes,j75yirs,t1_j75y26i
"Nah. We shall still recruit 2 good names. I'm not that worried about them. Strong team, but we can still beat them.",Arsenal,Yes,j766r8r,t1_j764gqy
"I'm amused at all the circle jerk around 
 Chelsea being shit comments, because apart from 1 or 2 players, their first team looks mad talented. And their squad already looks stacked as fuck.

"Agreed. Everton had a number of solid chances they could have converted and in that regard we were actually rather lucky defensively, while we didn‚Äôt create enough offensively in order to outweigh that. Actually think we looked much more solid against Newcastle, who are undoubtedly a better team than Everton",Arsenal,Yes,j77abds,t1_j76sif8
He doesn't need a wingback; he just needs an √òdegaard. The lack of support he gets from midfield is shocking.,Arsenal,Yes,j76wth8,t1_j76skcy
Your last statement. Mastering what ability? Beating your man one on one consistently? Long -range shooting?,Arsenal,Yes,j76vjti,t1_j76skcy
"I don't think so.

I have been laboring to explain Martinelli problems but people think critiquing an in-form player is sacrilege. Martinelli was subbed off for the exact reason I've been trying to explain. He's weak when he has to beat a man 1v1. Low blocks are his worst nightmare. He might sneak a ball in or two but that's his weakness. 

It's not a tactical thing. It's technical from his side. That's why his future is at ST. Zinchenko was inverted at City but his wingers flourished. The last 3-4 games weren't a surprise. Once you cut off the ""dash past my man"" play, you have eliminated 80% of the Martinelli threat.",Arsenal,Yes,j76y5b0,t1_j76skcy
"We need to put the theory that martinelli works better with wingback to bed. He has already played with Tierney alot and all it did was get in each others way. 

Besides we can't keep hiding martinelli all the time. He can't even take a player on. He needs some time on the bench to work on himself. 

Also the same thing was repeated all the time for pepe too. Can't believe we're going through this again.",Arsenal,Yes,j76zz1f,t1_j76skcy
"Hang in there dude, I just got into contact with a professional for the first time. It'll be a journey but we'll get through it, just like this season it'll have ups and downs.",Arsenal,Yes,j76w9uv,t1_j76unt1

">Everton have the perfect set up to play Dyche ball, don't know why they didn't get him earlier. 

Everton have delusions of grandueur and believe they should be playing more expansive football which is why they ran Big Sam Allardyce out of that shithole. Dyche will save them, then they will eventually turn on him. It's a tale as old as time with those bluenose cunts.",Arsenal,Yes,j76vmmu,t1_j76uo6l

"It's an Unai Emery team.  We let them score two quick ones, then let them take their foot off the gas like they always do and score five thereafter.",Arsenal,Yes,j773blt,t1_j7710zt
"HAHA I thought the same earlier, was like fuck it... forgot to put on the jersey. I'll take some of the blame with you.",Arsenal,Yes,j774xqp,t1_j772rgt
I bought a scarf at the armory earlier this season and we haven‚Äôt lost in since I‚Äôve been wearing it. I was too lazy to find it this morning. My bad fam.,Arsenal,Yes,j777pag,t1_j772rgt
"I wore my new shirt for the first time instead of my old one, been lowkey afraid it‚Äôs all my fault. Glad to know it was you instead, cheers",Arsenal,Yes,j778mnj,t1_j772rgt
"You kind of expected that back then, you knew that when the pressure was on that we didn't have the squad to maintain a title challenge. There was also a fragility to our game, we didn't have a planB.

I don't feel that with this team. I expect us to get a win against Brentford and get a result (draw, win) against City too. We'll see 

If it was back then with Wenger, we would lose against Brentford and get thumped by City",Arsenal,Yes,j77toa2,t1_j77qyra
"Lol I told people here as early as September. 

It's like PTSD-lite. Every time we have something good going, February is the month it all starts going wrong. If something catastrophic happens vs Brentford, I'll be a coward. I can't take more patterns.",Arsenal,Yes,j78iz41,t1_j77qyra
C'mon man could talk about grass looked dry but we should overcome those stuff,Arsenal,Yes,j78b1o4,t1_j78ao0t
"Yeah there's a definite sense of entitlement from some posts, as if we should be winning every game.

Any team would have struggled there today, they were up for it and got their tactics spot on.

We got beaten and we move on. Now if we drop points to Brentford at home, I'll be pissed off!",Arsenal,Yes,j78cgb5,t1_j78ao0t
"We are in a title race, only City's results matter.",Arsenal,Yes,j7820y9,t1_j77wxxa

"Yeah, its weird to blame a holding midfielder for our lack of goal production.

"It's still empty hatred for me... hard to explain, but, I hate Tottenham with such ferocity that it means something when we play each other, and I would never give that up. 

Chelsea I just hate because they are the antithesis of what I think a football club should be and they have achieved everything in the most scummy, bullshit, transfers-on-steroids way. Even when they were 'brilliant' under Mourinho the first time round they were winning with the most disgusting version of football. They don't have enough of an identity now to build meaningful hatred because they've changed managers / players so frequently that I don't even know what they are anymore.",Arsenal,Yes,j765or4,t1_j764po5
"Chelsea absolutely. Even growing up in London I‚Äôve hated Chelsea more than I‚Äôve hated Spurs. If Spurs got relegated for example, it‚Äôd be hilarious at first but then it would actually just be somewhat disappointing. The rivalry we have with Spurs is a lot of fun, and it would make the league just a bit more boring if they weren‚Äôt in it. Chelsea on the other hand? Could not give a flying fuck. I‚Äôd actually completely love it if the fucking cesspool of a business institution (it‚Äôs not a football club in my eyes) went into administration. There is everything wrong with Chelsea. There isn‚Äôt with Spurs apart from the fact that they are well, Spurs üòÇ",Arsenal,Yes,j7666e4,t1_j764po5
Always felt spurs was irrelevant so my hate was wasted on them. Way easier to hate Chelsea and United for turning football into Wallstreet.,Arsenal,Yes,j765co2,t1_j764po5
"I hate Chelsea more than Spurs now. At least Spurs was never a major threat to us historically and currently. And they didn't ruin the transfer market permanently.

The only time Spurs were a major threat to us was during our banter years (2017-2021) and it was for the CL spot, not any major trophy.",Arsenal,Yes,j7655ak,t1_j764po5
"I don‚Äôt hate spurs, they are a great rival to have but they are a good club, don‚Äôt have a sugar daddy, owned pretty well and their fans on the whole are decent at away days. I actually pity them more than anything else. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love beating them and and highly enjoy watching them lose and be shit, but I don‚Äôt ‚Äòhate them‚Äô. Maybe in part growing up in north London and having a lot of friends who are spurs fans. Don‚Äôt know any proper chelsea dans lol. 

Chelsea are just scum, fans are disgusting animals and they have financially doped their way to success through a really despicable owner. No competition for me who is worse. United are kind of half way in between the two.

"Spurs are meant to be largely irrelevant to us, sometimes a minor annoyance. Young fans don't seem to understand that because of the last 6 years or so.

Chelsea are actually rivals and took our spot as top contenders in the league and as biggest london club in early 2000s using nothing but money. They have disgusting fans, amoral ex players, no history to speak of, operate from the worst borough in london and represent the absolute worst in english football.

Putting chelsea a long way in our rear view mirror should be a long term goal of this club, spurs being average and being behind us will be an added bonus of that.

For all I hate spurs, I don't really have much bad to say about their club other than it's useless, it's too close to ours and they hate us. I wouldn't really want to see spurs go out of business or something.

"Failed talents are such a common thing in football too, will be interesting to see what an 8.5 year security does to a player's motivation to improve on limited game time.

Another thing, I have to imagine the talent pool in baseball is much smaller than football? If his talent hoarding had the effect of weakening rivals in baseball, that effect will be basically zero in football unless he signs another 35 players.",Arsenal,Yes,j75ylp3,t1_j75xp2r

"Baseball is also the same in a sense. Not just about one player or even two. Look at the Angels with Mike Trout and Ohtani. Two best players in the league and not even above .500. Dodgers are unique because they can spend a ton of money when they need to, but also they have the best development in the MLB. So Boehly is flexing his muscles becuz I assume he isn‚Äôt used to losing (as Dodgers are consistently a top team). He wants this rebuild to be quick and not last multiple years.

"Absolutely needed to be faster with the ball and in passing it. We weren't nearly aggressive enough at the start which gave them confidence.

"I mean sure it looks like that, but Boehly put him into a shit position. Got no input on transfers, just a bunch of random good players and was told to make it work mid season. Also the prices were so absurd making the pressure very high instantly. Pep would struggle massively if he got delt such a hand and I don‚Äôt think he would have found success. I feel a bit sorry because he seems a good manager to me, but he knew what he was getting into when he went to that shitshow.",Arsenal,Yes,j75xyrf,t1_j75xgr9
I think there might be more of a problem with the management and owner in general than specifically with Potter.,Arsenal,Yes,j75y3va,t1_j75xgr9
"It's a weird one. I think everyone acknowledges how good of a job he has done at his previous clubs, and he had Brighton playing great football, but the football is dire and he doesn't exude that weird footballmanic vibe you get from Pep, Klopp, Conte, Arteta and maybe even Ten Hag.

I'd be vary of writing him off already, but I'm surprised how poorly they are doing.

I think there's also the Arteta-effect, where people say ""look what giving your manager time does"". But 

a) Arteta is a fucking genius

b) The wheels only truly came off between early November and Christmas in 2020. Take out those 7 games and you'll see a team improving steadily over three years. 

It's conflated in people's minds because of how low in the table we were when he took the reigns, how low our poor run put us for the remainder of 2020/21 and how much we suffered early and late last season, due to our lack of depth.",Arsenal,Yes,j75z62w,t1_j75xgr9
"I wonder how much of Brighton's success is down to Potter alone or the club hierarchy.

Seeing them performing with De Zerbi makes it clear that they have a great hierarchy in place.

I don't think that Potter is a bad manager per se, and I think that he was handed a poisoned chalice. A club in flux after a change of ownership and hierarchy, a new owner eager to throw his weight around and cement himself in the league, and a patchwork team with aging players and random signings that were never integrated properly due to their revolving door of managers.

I think that it's unfair to pin it all on Potter; any manager would struggle under such circumstances.

Recall the beginning of Arteta's tenure, and how long it took Edu and him to bring us to where we are now.

The only question is: is Chelsea/Boehly going to give Potter time to actually turn things around and build something or will the cycle of short-termism continue?",Arsenal,Yes,j75zytz,t1_j75xgr9

It's not that we'll move away from him, but that he'll likely move away from us. I'm sure Arteta would be happy to keep him as a squad player, even on fairly high wages.",Arsenal,Yes,j78oh0c,t1_j78dlis
He may have been muted today but I w wouldn't call him our weakest link. Most players struggled today. While I do see Edu bringing in competition for him I believe he'll stay until the end of his contract,Arsenal,Yes,j78jcaj,t1_j78dlis
"Needs to happen eventually, but in a gradual way, he's too important to the team as a leader on and off the pitch for us to just sell him IMO. Whoever we buy or promote up to play in his position will probably share minutes with him at first.",Arsenal,Yes,j78mv44,t1_j78dlis

Something happening to partey could derail that but otherwise he's 100% the only starting 11 position due an upgrade. 

We're sounding out targets already in the likes of rice and we know from the mudryk deal there is money to spend. 

And a ~100m midfield isn't about to play from the bench behind xhaka or wait for partey to pull a muscle. 

We know the cash is there and we know we are looking at midfielders. It's just a case of can we get the one we want.

I can't say what xhaka will do when that happens. The club wants to keep him but I would predict it's not a done deal as hell want to keep playing 40 games a season until he's 35.",Arsenal,Yes,j797fph,t1_j78dlis

"> We must be the only team we‚Äôre one poor result is considered a ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù.

History has shown that this isn't completely inaccurate. Ever since we stopped being title challengers we've typically played well most of the time but then fall apart when some odd result hasn't gone our way. There's a reason that Arsenal have become known as a team that folds around February -this used to be the time when we'd be in the CL and just get battered in the R16 and start to lose league games",Arsenal,Yes,j78sa5k,t1_j78qlh2
"True on Xhaka. 

The entire left side has been like this for a while since Jesus left. Zinchenko being our best player is testament of his ability but also a statement on how much he carries everyone on the left.",Arsenal,Yes,j77dudk,t1_j778f2t

"Mudryk has those games where he struggles to get into games. Happened when he played for Shakhtar and Ukraine.

Madueke was much better than him.",Arsenal,Yes,j75vjpm,t1_j75v8hu
"The problem is that when you're a hundred million player with allegedly a guaranteed starter clause and according to some on here a generational talent then you're supposed to drag teams up to your level.

Let's be honest Kane, Auba, Van Persie on their own have carried otherwise quite disjointed teams, Mudryk for what Chelsea have signed up for should be at least one of their better players and he's not.

In gazumping us they've taken a project player and Sancho'd him.",Arsenal,Yes,j75w4gt,t1_j75v8hu
"Trossard definitely coz he is in good form, knows the leagues and has adapted to life in uk

Mudryk is yet to adapt to league, country, and played less than Trossard this season",Arsenal,Yes,j75ynu0,t1_j75yjdo
"Trossard is a 10/10 signing imo, gives us a better shot at the title than Mudryk would have done imo. Mudryk has a way higher ceiling but hes not there yet.

Jorginho will be very good in possession, but ngl I'm worried about him out of possession. Partey does so much defensively and I really cant see Jorginho doing what Partey does. So would have much prefered Caicedo.",Arsenal,Yes,j7608dn,t1_j75yjdo
"Trossard definitely better than Mudryk for immediate impact. Jorginho similar to Caicedo, maybe slightly ahead because he has the experience that might help the rest of the team out.",Arsenal,Yes,j75ypl3,t1_j75yjdo
"If we are only considering the next 6 months Trossard and Jorginho are probably the better options. No adaptation, lots of PL experience in the exact positions we need etc. 

Mudryk and Caicedo would obvs win out in the long term but we need to go all in to win the PL now, who knows when we will have this chance again. Hopefully we build a team that can consistently challenge but you never when the like of City, Chelsea, Man U and Liverpool might actually sort their shit out.",Arsenal,Yes,j760adn,t1_j75yjdo
"Too early but...

Mudryk was a big miss. We could have heavily rotated Martinelli and Mudryk without losing anything. One would do CL, another PL. Or 70 mins of one, and 20 of the other, interchanging. That kind for 3 years minimum. In fact, one would finally transition into a striker. 

Trossard is great technically. I'd say he has better raw abilities in tiny spaces and 1V1 than Martinelli. He however doesn't have his energy and explosiveness. You need those traits wide these days. Trossard can't mount a charge over 90 minutes. He's at most a 40 minutes players wide‚Äî a sub/depth. 

So, basically Martinelli win keep developing as he's now guaranteed more minutes than he would have with Mudryk. And Trossard will be able to wreck havoc in his cameos that will let Martinelli rest.  It's good business. 


As for Caicedo. I wasn't so bothered. Jorginho lacks the urgency we need now as the entire team is like a swarm of bees, but Caicedo for me lacks that technical edge. It's not to say he's bad at it. He's just not Jorginho. 

I hope we go back for him in the summer as a long term '8'. Not as a six. He has a future as a Kante clone, just not as a plain 6.",Arsenal,Yes,j7631mc,t1_j75yjdo
"We're already building for the future, and we need immediate impact players to see out the rest of the season.

This winter window was always going to have inflated prices; all mid-season windows do, but this one proceeds a World Cup.

It would be better to reinforce long-term during the summer, and get reliable talent that can perform now.

It's not sour grapes due to missing out on reported targets. Mudryk would have needed time (as evidenced by his performance last night) and Caicedo, though PL proven, is still developing and would have have to adapt to a new team.

I think the right decisions were made, regardless of the circumstances of how they came to be.",Arsenal,Yes,j760ope,t1_j75yjdo
I think martienlli has slowed down too since Jesus hasn‚Äôt been in the team. I feel like Jesus just makes this team tik so nicely. I like Eddie but I‚Äôm not gonna lie I‚Äôm really excited to see Jesus play again.,Arsenal,Yes,j779vfm,t1_j779clb
"That's what teams have been doing to City for years now and they've had to find other ways to play too.

"Everton essentially copied Newcastle, just with much a shittier squad and a lot less preparation.

> How do we counter having saka and martinelli being double teamed and having our entire midfield swamped

Don't forget the same level of attention to √òdegaard.

The answer is simple: replace or demand more from the position left wide open by all this marking, and whose lack of involvement leaves Martinelli marooned, and limits Zinchenko's ability to get forward even more than White's.",Arsenal,Yes,j77zhqo,t1_j77linb
"Tripling at times. Combine that with an off day for your striker & the whole midfield, and we end up with a performance like today's.

Great on them for figuring us out and sticking to thier plans for 90min.",Arsenal,Yes,j77npq4,t1_j77linb
This is where you need a more direct and aggressive central mid which Ode is not. I've said this before that he can take some things from James Maddison who will take his own initiative in midfield and go after the opposition whereas the tendency to play the passing game is far too ingrained into Ode's game,Arsenal,Yes,j77o9ba,t1_j77linb

It's just unrealistic to say Potter should get results now, either way their season's dead. He should be looking at stuff like fundamentals and culture building, and using the dead season to experiment with his 40 players to decide who to keep/chuck, as well as what's his best setup

"4. Tuchel. Unbeaten in 10 games. Win 7 draw 3. We have be naive if we ignore that its a big thing that we always seem to crumble. There is duncan ferguson'a everton, carrick's united off the top of my head.",Arsenal,Yes,j7a2bjj,t1_j7a03wn
"Ole had the ultimate new manager bounce, he looked like the second coming of Sir Alex Ferguson",Arsenal,Yes,j7a21af,t1_j7a03wn
"New manager bounce is a myth. I‚Äôm sure there are way more than three examples of new managers not doing well too. You can‚Äôt present the proof as the instances of something happening without acknowledging the times it doesn‚Äôt. 

Also, just to provide some context to those examples:

1) Our unbeaten run under Emery was built on quite a bit of fortune and getting results from games where we didn‚Äôt play well or it was decided on very fine margins. 

2) Rangnick started managing United when they had an easy set of fixtures. Not to mention it‚Äôs actually incorrect because United lost to Wolves in their fifth league game under him. 

3) Three games is an extremely small sample that shouldn‚Äôt even be worth considering. Two of those games were them grinding out 1-0 wins against midtable teams as well. Losing the following three games while conceding 3 goals in each of them comfortably cancels out any positive sentiments too.",Arsenal,Yes,j7a2k83,t1_j7a03wn
Think it was just to preserve Partey. He‚Äôs not at 100% and Arteta hoped Jorginho would be enough,Arsenal,Yes,j76ruzd,t1_j76rm99
"It's hard but I see the logic.

Against a low block, you need more of a better passer of the ball. You need more a pass than trying to go through the press. Those two are kind of better at the one route football. Odegaard draws attention to himself, Partey despite everything is a relatively poor passer for a pivot. 

It just didn't work but you get the logic. 

Also, I hope people stop this 'make subs!!' whenever a game isn't going well. Such games end in wallowing in self-pity but should also be lessons. The manager starts the best players and unless the first XI player is returning from injury, usually bench players are second best.",Arsenal,Yes,j76z12n,t1_j76rm99
Honestly one of the saddest thing about Mo‚Äôs injury is that we won‚Äôt hear his awesome chant to twist and shout this season üò¢,Arsenal,Yes,j75xmg9,t1_j75xbda

You're able to hope someone succeeds, while wanting us to be better.",Arsenal,Yes,j76762u,t1_j761bsu
"Martinelli's problems should be obvious by now. Even if one can't see them, you could watch any Martinelli clip, then 5 other clips of top wingers and notice what he needs to do better. It's so simple. If you insist that you don't know better wingers, just watch the ones we have been linked to. You'll get a more informed opinion.

I don't like Trossard wide but I prefer he starts against low blocks either wide, or in that Xhaka role.  Sub in Martinelli if we unlocked the low block and they are now desperate to attack. Martinelli is almost world class at counterattacks and is very good defensively.",Arsenal,Yes,j771aea,t1_j76xzfx
[deleted],Arsenal,Yes,j76zchd,t1_j76xzfx

"He'd be great in Xhaka's role imo. He is creative, can drop deeper into midfield, and is also comfortable out on the wing. He'd profile similarly to what Xhaka describes as a ""fake 10"" lol

"I might get slated for this, but I think he‚Äôs a good player with a lot to his game. Yes, he‚Äôs currently underperforming, but put him in a decent team and watch him transform into a beast. He‚Äôs not a technical wizard or genius maestro, but he‚Äôs one of those players that can do a bit of everything.

I feel he‚Äôs currently experiencing a similar slump to the ‚Äòold‚Äô Rashford. It won‚Äôt surprise me if he regains his form soon. You don‚Äôt win player of the year twice at a club like Chelsea if you‚Äôre a shit player.

It‚Äôs very unlikely Chelsea will sell him to us, especially if Jorginho turns out to be great transfer.",Arsenal,Yes,j75vj4l,t1_j75unvf
"'With Kante' is the most important thing there.

He made Danny Drinkwater look good enough for Chelsea to  spend Salah money on.",Arsenal,Yes,j75wd8d,t1_j75unvf
We shouldn't be buying players based on a past purple patch.,Arsenal,Yes,j75vspw,t1_j75unvf
"I love players like Mount. My only problem with them is that they normally become pretty useless when they lose their extra lung. 

Trossard isn't explosive but he will at least carry a bit of technical ability into his later years.",Arsenal,Yes,j75wmqt,t1_j75unvf

He was really poor today. It seems like the work he did to improve his agility and quickness has worn off with the rigor of the season.,Arsenal,Yes,j77ey5n,t1_j77cplo
"The thing is this is easy to say in hindsight. If we would have lost the FA Cup and also lost one of the main players to injury in that game and then lost today to Everton, we'd be pointing to the FA Cup saying ""Why did we start player X in the FA Cup when he is so crucial for the title race ?""",Arsenal,Yes,j77jat7,t1_j77ig6q
Starting 11 doesn‚Äôt guarantee we would have won either.,Arsenal,Yes,j77jfru,t1_j77ig6q

Where do these comments come from?,Arsenal,Yes,j797z4c,t1_j78y3l5
"But you understand the problem you are describing isn't solely to do with Tierney.

Whoever we have on the bench we will question if they could have changed things, it's in the nature of football fans. 

Only way you'll be happy is if we have a squad of 11 players or we win all our games?",Arsenal,Yes,j79628f,t1_j78y3l5
">he becomes the answer

Maybe if you aren't fully reading what people are saying.

They are seeing our games and observing which sort of play style might help us get out of a rut. Today we didn't have enough support on the wings and didn't overlap much which is a different plan that Tierney would help with.",Arsenal,Yes,j79vcgf,t1_j78y3l5
"Ah this take.

Maybe Jonathan David? Chupa Akpom? Aubameyang?",Arsenal,Yes,j76wz3o,t1_j76sw41

"I completely disagree. Eddie is most useful against the big teams who will try and play their game against us, where we can get Eddie the ball in the penalty box with consistency. Against teams who sit back and park the bus, we need Jesus, whose abilities are better suited to breaking down that defense. We just need Jesus healthy",Arsenal,Yes,j77a05u,t1_j76sw41
Never want City to get the one thing they've not been able to buy yet,Arsenal,Yes,j75y9mg,t1_j75xuya

The right answer is Madrid,Arsenal,Yes,j75xzer,t1_j75xuya
"No thanks... If you're an Arsenal fan you don't want another Premier league club winning their first one before us. Its bad enough Chelsea have 2 now. Plus, Madrid have always been good to us.",Arsenal,Yes,j75y0d0,t1_j75xuya
"Real madrid easily, fuck city all day long. I hate their ""ooo but we play such beatiful football you have to like us"" bullshit. You'll be hard pressed to find a longtime football fan that puts up with their sportswashing",Arsenal,Yes,j75zpko,t1_j75xuya
"Hope City win nothing this year to be honest. Hope they get to the final in the FA cup and UCL and lose both, and we win the league.",Arsenal,Yes,j760tr5,t1_j75xuya
"‚ÄòDeserve‚Äô is a strange word. They‚Äôve bought their success and have one of the best squads and arguably the best manager in the world yet they‚Äôve failed season after season in Europe.     

Madrid on the other hand deserve all the success they‚Äôve gotten because Liverpool and City have been in the top 3 best teams in the world over the last five years yet Madrid have consistently stayed winning, even with major changes to their management, front line and back line and even when they‚Äôve fallen behind in major games.",Arsenal,Yes,j75zgrf,t1_j75xuya
"Madrid. 

However I‚Äôd take city this year if they decide to effectively bin this season in the league for us to win so they can win champs league üòú

"City.

I'm not a fan of clubs hogging trophies. City should lose out on PL, but not CL. Besides, it doesn't even pinch that hard. They have emptied an entire oil field into the squad. No passion there.

"""rarely"" lol",Arsenal,Yes,j78dcvz,t1_j78cp8i
"Denial of legit Martinelli criticism is kind of weird. People aren't even saying he's shit and he should leave. 

He's not a good dribbler but as a 21 year old, he can work on it. 

People go so deep into their denial that they tell themselves that the club targeting Raphinha and trying to spend ‚Ç¨95M on Mudryk to come and be his depth. 

Maybe with Jesus, he will get a chance to occupy more central areas. The wing thing just keeps exposing him.",Arsenal,Yes,j78fzli,t1_j78cp8i
"Strongly disagree, and if you are saying this due to today's result, I think it was more a lack of tactical adaptation which led to a build up in pressure and thus resulting in a loss in focus and composure",Arsenal,Yes,j77d9ix,t1_j77al0n
">but we clearly didn't do the business this window to win the league, owners are asking us for patience which is fair, they own the club and they dont care about the title

Nonsence. We were willing to drop 75mil on Mudryk and got out done by a mega bid from Chelsea and then we also willing to splash 75m on Caicedo and Brighton flat our refused. We also wanted Zubimendi who wasn't available. Stop throwing toys out the pram over one loss",Arsenal,Yes,j77bmmk,t1_j77al0n
"Bad take.

We have been trying to be title contenders for the last 3 windows. Martinez, Vlahovic, Raphinha, Locatelli, Kounde‚Äî name it. We have done enough. We just aren't an A+ team with funds. 

A lot of people see this transfer business as emotional. That you just tell a player about a project and its done. The Mudryk transfer should have told everyone what was up. You could have project appeal, the cash and even a player agent on your side and still lose to a bag of cash. 

Jorginho over Elneny is an upgrade.

Trossard over ESR is.

Kiwior over literally nobody is an upgrade too. 

Yet we were title contenders with those players. 

Arsenal spent fine given the circumstances. There was just always a bigger fish. 

And today's game wasn't on effort in the market. It was on the very individuals that have us 5 points ahead.",Arsenal,Yes,j77d7ry,t1_j77al0n

"That midfield block was working like a charm for them. Could never get much space around the box. Trossard might have been the better option to start, overall I just think we were isolated to less promising parts of the pitch. Dyche plays 'boring' football but when it works it's due to whatever system is against him not having alternatives. We needed to be much more direct and visionary with our passing, and we only play like that when we have more space in the midfield. I was really disappointed with our ability on set pieces offensively and defensively. Was the only way I could see us winning and we just didn't have it today.",Arsenal,Yes,j76s84n,t1_j76rgsq

13 goals in their last 8 PL games is not something to look down upon as well,Arsenal,Yes,j75vvag,t1_j75vqmm
"Their defence is really good and well organised and Guimaraes does a good job of shielding their backline, but some of them are not the fastest and they don't play with a high line. If they want to be more attacking they need to push up which will expose them more at the back. Teams have started sitting deeper against them now which is why they're starting to see more draws. They're tied for most draws in the league with Brentford (9/20 games) giving them only a 50% win rate. They'll need to push up eventually but they'll be exposed on the counter with all of these teams sitting back.

Also they've invested more in their attack than we have lol. Amiron, ASM, Gordon, Isak and Wilson cost ‚Ç¨180m. We've only spent ‚Ç¨85m on our attack (Jesus, Saka, Martinelli, Trossard, Nketiah, Nelson & ESR).",Arsenal,Yes,j75yxod,t1_j75wact
"Little different, Diaby we still had hope he could come good, same with RvP and his injuries. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

For Arteta, he was 33 and when he got his 1 year contract extension. We could have forced an early retirement to save money, he had no transfer value and I'm sure a player of his age coming back from such a serious injury would not elicit any offers. It might sound crazy but just back in 2014, the idea of players playing beyond 33 was extremely rare. In the very next season, Arteta played 9 PL games, and only once for more than 35mins. I'm certain it was a contract extension not based on football or financial reasons.",Arsenal,Yes,j765zr3,t1_j765elv

"They probably will go for a striker but honestly their form is not going to dictate that, they will do it regardless of where they finish.  

But our best hope with Chelsea is they finish outside of European places or in Europa conference spot. 

This will make it harder to attract top players, sow discontent amongst their massive squad, force loans and transfers they may not want to make and make it harder to balance the books. 

The more desperate they get the more likely they are to make desperate moves and overstretch themselves or even come a cropper of ffp.

But if he won't give back my money and stay a part of this MLM, then we'll go our separate ways",Arsenal,Yes,j75zpwk,t1_j75y73w
"I still think Chelsea will do a 4231 pretty soon , and Jorgi isn't a guarantee starter when Kante/Kovacic/Zakaria is back from injuries. All three is quite solid as double pivot.",Arsenal,Yes,j75vni3,t1_j75v33c
Yeah. They focused too much on the new signings and didn't care about the players already in their squad.,Arsenal,Yes,j75v89p,t1_j75v33c
"What about Gourcuff, Chris Samba and M'Vila,",Arsenal,Yes,j763wsl,t1_j763isv

"Agree, we will hopefully build a big lead through March. Our final 3 games are quite kind to us (Brighton (h), forest (a), wolves (h)) but just before then in april is quite tough with games away to pool, city, Newcastle and the home Chelsea game.

Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they try to buy Felix but I can‚Äôt imagine that working out.,Arsenal,Yes,j75z4fc,t1_j75yx9a
Yeah so they actually have to sell these lads or pay them off if you haven't noticed. Otherwise they stay there. It's not as easy as you make it sound. These lads are on huge wages and can't get into an injury ridden squad in 10th. Teams won't be throwing money around for them.,Arsenal,Yes,j760jmm,t1_j75yx9a
"Potter clearly has no say in signings.  He also doesn‚Äôt seem to have autonomy over the first 11 starts.  A coach doesn‚Äôt start a player 3 days after signing him, giving the player basically zero match prep or wider understanding of how the coach wants him to play.
He also wouldn‚Äôt start a clearly very unfit Mudryk over other players.
Potters time at Brighton has shown he isn‚Äôt an idiot, so those decisions are just bizarre.
Will the next coach get more autonomy? I doubt it.  Potter only joined 4 months ago, so I doubt the management is going to change their style overnight for a new coach.",Arsenal,Yes,j768jdz,t1_j766wyz
"One vs. one Martinelli is incredible, the problem we see in games like this is he is forced out to touch against more than one, which is an extremely tough thing for a winger to beat. You have to be near on perfect with the ball at your feet to consistently beat teams that double or triple up on you.

Having an overlap provides extra width support which typically takes a defender away leaving more one vs one opportunities.",Arsenal,Yes,j76vuha,t1_j76vjti

"As an older fan that's simply untrue, Spurs were better than us until Dein bought in (and overtook us again when he fucked up).

"It mainly is management and owner but at the same time the Chelsea management job requires very strong dogged personalities (Mourinho, ancelotti, conte, tuchel) if they want a chance of succeeding. Ditto for United. They‚Äôre the two toughest top 6 management jobs imo.

"Disagree (I‚Äôm not basing this on just today). Partey is WC, and Ode is well on his way there (a top CM this season already). There‚Äôs no other upgrade needed out of our starting 11 apart from MAYBE Ramsdale, but hes young and growing into being a great GK.

Imagine having a Jude/Camavinga/SMS/Mount (even with his rough patch right now).

Dream scenario for me a few weeks ago would‚Äôve been to pay extra for Caicedo, and get Rice and go for Gundogan on a free, and move on from Xhaka.

There‚Äôs an element of ruthlessness we need to make sure we capitalize on our success and continue to build, and don‚Äôt end up like Liverpool

Edit: that dream scenario assuming we got caicedo instead of Jorginho, we have him now, no longer want Gundogan",Arsenal,Yes,j78m3lp,t1_j78jcaj
"You have to see what happened though and assess if changes need to be made.

"What has Mudryk shown so far that assures you he is a ‚Äòbig miss‚Äô. Wait for him to score or at least assist a goal. Are people still starstruck because he dribbled past a 40 year old Milner who had been playing for an hour?

Imo it‚Äôs the complete opposite with him and Trossard. Trossard has played full matches in the PL and proven himself so he can rotate with Martinelli.

If Mudryk had come he would have developed slowly and in the meantime would come on as an impact sub. 

Way to raw to be starting him in PL and CL. And before you say, he was good in the CL last year. He was the best out of Shaktar and that‚Äôs not saying that much.",Arsenal,Yes,j7642t6,t1_j7631mc

He's getting leeway because the press always give teams that spend time because otherwise they'd have to admit that the transfers that make up probably 90% of their biggest headlines aren't actually the answer and that's not going to happen when you need daily or even 24 hour rolling sports news.,Arsenal,Yes,j75w8pu,t1_j75vp0k
That‚Äôs fair but he was class today. Defensively and offensively. It‚Äôs easy to say all he did was stop play and bare minimum but that‚Äôs just not true. He was incredible all round. Kept a close eye on him too and he was impressive.,Arsenal,Yes,j76xlx8,t1_j76wis7

"Teams show him down the left and he just sprints down to that side and does nothing, as you said he gets a lucky corner or something. He is way too predictable. He doesn‚Äôt have the ability to glide around the pitch and that shiftiness that Saka has or even Trossard. 

Even when he scored against west ham and brighton I thought he still played very poorly. He needs a run out of the team and to run at defences as a super sub. The game will become easier for him and he‚Äôll be able to get at tired defences.",Arsenal,Yes,j771gv5,t1_j76zchd
"I still thought he played poorly in a lot of games this season and they were covered up by a goal or an assist, which is why I was never really sold on his ranking as a player. Saka was struggling early season but he was still making the correct decisions on and off the ball and helping the team function properly. Martinelli has been breaking down attacks for months now, he‚Äôs too predictable when he runs at defenders and makes bad decisions too often.",Arsenal,Yes,j772ofp,t1_j771too

"I actually think it goes the other way tbh. I think people think that you can't criticise Martinelli, and so over egg the pudding the other way. 

I'm not saying you're doing that, but I do reject what OP is saying when they say he 'rarely beats his man'.

I think a fair criticism is that he's very take on orientated, all he wants to do is beat his man and when it's not working, he ends up running into cul de sacs time and again.

But he's absolutely roasted some of the best defenders in the league. It's generally speaking what he's best at. You'd have to think that's what Arteta is asking him to do, break the lines with dribbling. 

Ultimately, he's 21. He's going to have flaws in his game. He's basically a one man army on the left wing at the minute with Zinchenko underlapping into midfield and Eddie staying largely central. With an overlapping fullback or Jesus/Xhaka going out to help, you see a different Martinelli.",Arsenal,Yes,j78m798,t1_j78fzli

I don't know if you watched arsenal more than a year. Martinelli and Tierny used to play a lot of games together in previous seasons. They had zero chemistry. They just ran into each other a lot. It never worked. That's why you don't see them playing together.,Arsenal,Yes,j79jcah,t1_j7755dw
"You're probably not rude, but you're def and idiot getting worked up misunderstanding what I said. I didn't say martinelli is as bad as pepe. 

I compared the fans who kept saying then, that Pepe needs an overlapping fullback to play well. Now we are repeating the same thing with martinelli. He is off form, he needs some time on the bench",Arsenal,Yes,j79hkl7,t1_j7791kr

"Mount was poor but Cucu was fine his job was to invert and underlap to give Mudryk space to run because he's a touchline winger.

"Your comment is filled with hyperboles and hypocrisy which means you're more interested in the banter than actual discussion. As a banter-centric submission, I agree with it. 

But to ride back to an actual discussion:

‚Äî When you tell me to wait until he scores or assists, it's a very simplistic way of seeing players. This is how we thought ESR would keep Odegaard out of the XI. Because the only way to see that a player is good is G/A. People see new players and quickly google up G/A. No wonder people still thought Pepe would come good. 


‚Äî Then you simplify Mudryk's cameo to 'beating 40 year old Milner'. This isn't 2000 where the game has disappeared from the Internet. Watch it and see if that's all he did in that game. 


‚Äî You also tell me to wait, but are slandering the same player without waiting. 

‚Äî I think he's a big miss because we gladly pushed to break our transfer record for him. Not just that, his ex-managers and every report we got showed that he has the potential to be a top 2-3 player in his position. It explains why two clubs fought for him. 

‚Äî Also thinking we were about to spend ‚Ç¨95M on a bench player is a bit naive. 

‚Äî Discarding performances in weaker leagues is also a vice that some of you need to outgrow. Luka Modric ran rings around people straight out of the Croatian League. Good players are good regardless. Also saying Mudryk wouldn't start a CL game is wild. 

I'll enjoy slandering Mudryk as I'm still salty about losing him, but I need the discussion labeled from the start on if it's banter or serious.",Arsenal,Yes,j7663bt,t1_j7642t6
The few times I've seen us put ESR in the middle I've not been impressed. He's much better when he has space to run at defenders or to arrive unannounced in the box and that's much harder to do from central mid,Arsenal,Yes,j77p9cl,t1_j77ozwn
Catholics Vs Protestants looking at a mere 80 year rivalry thinking 'thats cute',Arsenal,Yes,j75xknx,t1_j75wv06
He does link up better but I think it's a cop out as to why he isn't playing well. If you look at the things he was doing individually in the first half of the season it is very different to what he is doing now. He is very loose in possession and his touch has gone missing.,Arsenal,Yes,j78d7oq,t1_j78cz11
"Never be afraid of saying something just because the sub will be angry. In my early days here, I was like this; made a lot of takes that were just feel good stuff to fit in. You realise you're being dishonest. 

I learnt that honest takes age well more often than reactionary ones. 

Saying Ozil is the problem was once pretty unpopular here. I remember watching Auba become shit in real time and making the observation but people fought it with all kinds of excuses. 

Make your claim. Defend it. But most importantly, be ready to learn. Some guys here actually know their stuff. 

Back to Gabbie, there is no system change or personnel that can make you miss easy passes and fall to beat your man as many times as he fails. It's either mental or raw ability and pointing out that he needs to do better shouldn't make you feel bad. 

To contradict myself a little tho, yeah. Sometimes let people have fun. Keep it to yourself. I still have unpopular opinions I rather not say too lol. People think this team is complete for some reason.",Arsenal,Yes,j78i1f9,t1_j78c5bs

You‚Äôre just repeating what I said. Still has zero end product which forced him to play deeper because he was a donkey in front of goal,Arsenal,Yes,j77lz1y,t1_j77l1n1
"Chelsea's squad before their summer's transfers were at the end of their life cycle, which was why Tuchel had a terrible time. They had CBs who wanted to leave or couldn't defend, midfielders whose ages were showing and started getting injuries (see Kante). Wingers who didn't press and couldn't dribble and beat defenders 1v1. And basically nobody at striker, to the extent that they had to buy the ghost of Aubameyang

They were due a HUGE refresh, similar to when pep first came or when Arteta took over

It's not as dissimilar. If we look at current teams, Liverpool's another team that's due a refresh also. And they're not getting it, which is why they are at mid table. Chelsea right now is where we were 2 years ago

We can check back in after Potter's had a full preseason. I sincerely doubt they'd be as trash as they are right now",Arsenal,Yes,j75xttm,t1_j75xahz
"He'd be great in Xhaka's role and was even appearing wide like a winger. Would bring Trossard into more natural positions for him.

Two issues are, is his passing consistent enough? He's been great everytime I've seen him but many say he's a shit passer. 

Secondly, the sort of aggression he was showing...he'd be a yellow card magnet...ref was weak today and let it become a physical game like Southampton one. Not every game is like that.",Arsenal,Yes,j773bn2,t1_j76xlx8
"Yes he did. But he went to the Man United academy, not the first team after he just signed",Arsenal,Yes,j761uxp,t1_j7611su
"A lot of academy players come from other teams, don't they?",Arsenal,Yes,j761xjs,t1_j7616sb
"1) Football is a results-based sport like every other but managers are rated on how they have their team playing and whether their approach is sustainable, so performances do matter. If a team wins because they were clinical with their chances while the opposition had a bad day converting their chances, that has little to do with the manager‚Äôs tactics, or at least that of a good one. No reliable or effective gameplan should rely on basically getting lucky.

2) That‚Äôs mostly a cliche broadcasters use to hype the Premier League. Of course any team is capable of beating even a big side on a good day like Everton just did but there are definitely easy fixtures in the league, or at least fixtures you‚Äôre expected to win. Also, the run United went on under Rangnick wasn‚Äôt even that good. In addition to their defeat, they dropped points in games where they were the favourites. If there truly isn‚Äôt such a thing as an easy fixture, you‚Äôd see teams winning the league with 70-75 points, and I‚Äôm probably being generous with that points total. 

Newcastle didn‚Äôt immediately become good under Eddie Howe. Their performances only started improving after their January signings. Before they faced United, they had lost three straight games conceding 11 goals, and only won once. At the time, it was definitely seen as a bad result for United. 

3) I disagree, two games is practically insignificant in this discussion. Besides, it contradicts the idea of a new manager bounce for Emery, since he lost his first couple of games.",Arsenal,Yes,j7amq6p,t1_j7abt23
"We sometimes do. Sometimes with a little more trickery ala Mitoma, Martinelli has chances to be 1v1 with the keeper or at least eliminate one DF for a good chance. He then decides to pause and try to burn pace past his man. Many defenders now know this and wait for him to do it...then he loses the ball.",Arsenal,Yes,j7735dv,t1_j772rx0
It is what it is. One game at a time.,Arsenal,Yes,j77pubn,t1_j77pj2a
It comes down to price in terms of whether I'd want him here. His current deal expires 2024. He'd have 1 year remaining and if he gennuinely wants to join and refuses to recontract with Chelsea we might be able to get a decent deal. However with the English tax he might still wind up being 50m pounds though and at that price we might be able to find better alternatives. 45ishm and below it's a go IMO even if he's got a year left. I think he's really really good,Arsenal,Yes,j75w5l3,t1_j75vh4m
Our record vs Everton at goodison is bad we should change that,Arsenal,Yes,j75wqj5,t1_j75w8lh
"Or make the winner of the FA cup get an automatic group-stage berth in the Champions League.

I was being somewhat hyperbolic but I don't think I am wrong. If you constantly try the same thing then it is inevitable he will beat his man sometimes but over the course of 90 minutes he just doesn't do it enough to justify his presence on the pitch.

"Re Martinelli, part of it may be confidence, but that's arguably a second order consequence of missing Jesus: he doesn't get played in to the positions where he's most dangerous, then starts to lose trust in the other parts of his game. 

Ultimately, though, Martinelli is not a one on one player like Saka; he can push it around a defender but he doesn't have the same precision in tight spaces. He can be a great wide player for us in the right setup, with someone who can get him the ball on the run toward goal. Figuring out how to get him going with Nketiah in the middle, and Odegaard playing on the right side of the pitch, is a big challenge for Arteta to work through.",Arsenal,Yes,j797oye,t1_j78i1f9

"Boehly was stupid enough to sack Chelsea's entire back room staff but caught on quick that instead of being taken for a ride by other clubs he could let English clubs negotiate a deal and swoop in at the last minute to gazump it and probably pay less than if he'd done it himself.

Unfortunately (or fortunately) he seems quite willing to promise whatever is needed to do that where someone with experience might have told him he was being taken for a ride or that effectively using a player as just a pawn without taking into account his feelings might not be the greatest idea for a guy you want on an 8 year contract.

I'm also slightly of the opinion he's not really grasped the sheer global nature of football over baseball. I wonder if he's trying so hard to stop his rivals getting their number one targets is because he thinks there's a more limited pool of players and we won't be able to find someone as effective.

"The Arsenal ticketing site is an actual disgrace, completely unfit for purpose. I'm not even talking about the queueing system when tickets go on sale, which would need an entire other essay. 

I was on the exchange for the Brentford game literally day yesterday. I work from home, so I can have it open on my laptop and refresh every few minutes. I must've refreshed well over a thousand times yesterday. This is where the problems start. 

If you refresh the page about 8-9 times, you get thrown out and locked out for a while. Not a problem, I can use a private browsing window. I get on the private window, I have to do a captcha. Captcha barely works half the time, takes ages to get in. I get to the list of events screens, I click Brentford, another captcha. Same as before. I get on the tickets screen - session expired. I have to go back and log in again. I click the Brentford event, another captcha. Rinse and repeat all day.

I did this for hours yesterday, and I saw three tickets go up the entire day. Here's how that goes: Refresh page, see a ticket available, click it in the sidebar, ticket gone. In no less than 2 seconds, the ticket has gone. How the fuck is this system supposed to be workable? It needs a complete rework. 

My proposal: since it's basically already a raffle depending on if you can get passed all the captchas, session timeouts, and click the ticket in time - why not make it an actual raffle. For each game you want to go to, you sign up to the ""I want a ticket"" list. When a ticket is listed on the exchange, it gets randomly given, lottery style, to one of these accounts. 

Oh, and by the way, if you go on StubHub or whatever else trashy websites, you can see hunderds of tickets to this game for sale for ¬£300. Club needs to do something, because this is a disgrace.",Arsenal,No,j71391t,t3_10seuct

"Yes.

While there have been subsequent reports that muddied the waters, the reporting in the window was that getting Caicedo would not have altered our pursuit of Rice come summer.

There is a very strong chance Jorginho will want to leave when we sign someone (e.g. notably Rice)  and we won't stand in his way.

There is a strong chance Xhaka will leave when he's no longer starting.

A single signing (e.g. Rice) could do both; two would certainly do it.

Elneny probably would stay to be Gunnersaurus, but at a certain point, he'll go too.

Sambi *might* find himself at Palace and come back, but at this point, doubt is reasonable.

We'll have plenty of room in the squad, even if we bring Patino home.",Arsenal,Yes,j71idro,t1_j717xcr
"> I think Jorginho will go to Lazio or something after the season finishes

I have a feeling Jorginho will be here next season. Don't think he came here -- and Arteta brought him here -- just for six months. 

I mean we've all heard about how much Arteta's wanted him over the years. Now that he finally has his man, I don't think Arteta's going to let Jorginho go this quickly.

So next season could be our first season back in the Champs League after a while. Think having someone like Jorginho who's a proven winner at European level and who has experience of seeing out European ties will be crucial next season. Why would Arteta let all that go in 6 months?

What could happen is Jorginho stays for the rest of this season, the whole of next season, and gets sold in the summer of 2024. We'll still get a transfer fee after exercising our option in the contract and extending his stay by a year.

Now the question is what does this mean for the pursuit of Rice and Caicedo. I think Jorginho coming means we won't go for the both of them.

From what Ornstein said in an athletic podcast a few days ago, there's been a lot of behind the scenes work done to get Rice. So if Rice comes in as everyone says he will, and Jorginho's there too, I don't think Arsenal will be going for Caicedo again.

According to reports, Arsenal have extended Elneny's stay by a year too. Caicedo coming in as well will lead to a bloated squad with just too many midfielders.

So I think it will just be Rice coming in the summer.",Arsenal,Yes,j71sj58,t1_j717xcr

"It's weird, they have a strange habit of assuming transfer successes before they have even played.

Ndombele and Lo Celso big money flops, but apparently Romero, Richarlison and Porro (despite not even playing) are proof they have fixed their recruitment?! 

Richarlison wasn't even that good for Everton..... Romeo plays in legitimately the worst defence in the league and if you watch Spurs he's only really good at one on one's and interceptions outside of the box, he's pretty horrific positonally and defending his box, and we be exposed pretty soon. 

It's taken them till now to move away from the Peresic is the best player in his position narrative.

Delusional.",Arsenal,Yes,j715855,t1_j7105sk

"Bound to happen. Both two very similar players who are in peak forms and massive prospects (Saka more so), both wingers, both play for two teams in which the fans hate each other. Both scored cracking goals in the game recently and did the same celebration. 

Only difference is Rashford is 4 years older than Saka. Saka‚Äôs ceiling of potential is absolutely ridiculous when you think about it.",Arsenal,Yes,j72mzeb,t1_j72lcfy
"You're not trying to recoup the money in sales 

The value for top teams is in winning.
How much value did our fans and team get from the last half decade of no champions league football?

It's down to results, not the margins on the spreadsheets.",Arsenal,Yes,j716rcd,t1_j7164m5

I cannot think of a player less compatible with DycheBall than Pepe,Arsenal,Yes,j710rxp,t1_j710esl

"Yeah. Too much turnover, and their clueless fans just don't seem to register the fact that when you give a new manager 16 new players, not all of which he wanted, it's gonna take some time.

"There was a short period of time when Rashford was linked with PSG and us. And I thought he would be a baller under Arteta. NowTen Haag has revived him and that looks impossible. 

This is how I feel about CHO too. Both of them are players with incredible potential that were mismanaged by their teams. If he was cheap enough and motivated enough I think he is worth a punt",Arsenal,Yes,j71va1d,t1_j71h7ol
"Great potential, I like him. He's been around for a while and not quite kicked on, so people have lost patience. Give him a suitable environment and consistent minutes and he'll go up a level.

It's a similar odd to Brugge winning the CL",Arsenal,Yes,j74j62e,t1_j74eddk
"It's not impossible for them to drop in the table... But relegation isn't even in the realm of likelihood. Most seasons 35 points is enough to be safe.

I do think liverpool see likely to pass them, and villa have been getting results under emery. Palace and forest could push chelsea. But i think that's about it.",Arsenal,Yes,j75l5lk,t1_j74eddk

Saka definitely,Arsenal,Yes,j718212,t1_j717aik
"Xhaka for me. The turnaround has shown what an absolute diamond this bloke is as a human imo. Could‚Äôve left when everything was going to shit, stayed and fought hard for not only his place in the team but to win back the fans. It‚Äôs a terrific story.",Arsenal,Yes,j718u0u,t1_j717aik

"I think xhaka gets very close, his redemption arc will become a significant part of Arsenal history. 

Arteta definitely becomes a legend",Arsenal,Yes,j71lga5,t1_j717aik
"It's business, by playing him in a League game we stand to receive huge compensation if someone else sign him. If he plays in U23 instead of U18 compensation goes up, appearance in a League game will go up significantly.",Arsenal,Yes,j75lw43,t1_j75g80s

"> It‚Äôs in their culture to expect immediate results which I doubt Potter can deliver now. 

That's the fundamantal issues I see with Chelsea that gives me hope for the future.

Abramovich spent hugely but he didn't sign to stupid contracts and he always backed new managers with new signings because that's what instant return managers want. Yes it led to a few bad years and they've finished mid table a couple of times but then he always spent the next year with a new short term specialist and all was great.

Now Boehly has spent big and he thinks he's found the cheat code with stupidly long contracts but if Potter isn't given time or can't work with these players then things become very interesting.

Get in another project manager and possibly miss out on CL again is OK if you're us but the majority shareholder in Chelsea is an investment capital firm and they are going to want a return on their investment. More pertinently the Chelsea fans expect shiny new players every year, they expect trophies every year and after Boehly Big Bollocks spent half a billion on players in his first year they're going to expect him to keep doing it. 

Now he can't because the amortisation would kill them and because they simply don't ahve enough squad spaces so you get in a guy to turn things round quickly...and then you're aking a Conte or a Jose to win without spending on 'their' players and a brief look at Spurs shows you how that goes both from a silverware and happiness perspective.

Now there are caveats; Chelsea's owners agreed not to sell for a decade so there is a project time scale in there built in and he has bought *so* many players that there's no way at least some of them don't turn out to be top tier eventually but even with that ¬£1.75b investment promise baked into their calculations I'm not sure the players, fans or owners will be happy to see it used to buy out contracts of players they need to get rid of and that still counts towards FFP...",Arsenal,Yes,j75kth7,t1_j75iyv5
"I think potter is ""good"" tactically, but his strength is culture building.

Its hard to implement tactics when you don't have chemistry. And it's hard to have chemistry when you spend 611m in one year, over a dozen new players over the two transfer windows.",Arsenal,Yes,j75kdsg,t1_j75iyv5
"Yeah the Brighton still doing well makes you think how big a part the club plays in setting up the team culture. 

I do think potter is still a good manager but terrible fit for Chelsea. He won't be given time or authority to build culture. He hasn't and won't be given players he wants to align to his culture / tactics. Look at the new signings there is no take time to integrate into the team he's just throwing them on and hoping. 

I feel like he knows he has to get results in the short term so is trying to do stuff that he's not good at",Arsenal,Yes,j75l8aj,t1_j75iyv5
"I always said that a manager who is good for a mid table club isnt guaranteed success at a big club. We have Emery, Moyes and Rodgers as examples.",Arsenal,Yes,j75li2d,t1_j75iyv5
"Potter looks a passenger at Chelsea, all these players he didn't need or particularly want and now he has to mould them into a team. They looked hopeless yesterday and it was beautiful. I doubt Potter will last the season.",Arsenal,Yes,j75trgm,t1_j75iyv5
Also fits perfectly into the counter pressing and second ball winning that our front five are tasked with when we go long. Really exciting to envision how he shapes our midfield,Arsenal,Yes,j71i6f1,t1_j71dbtl
"Haven't finished the episode yet but is Zubimendi not like another J20? If the manager likes him then I can't speak against it, however the prem style will always need physicality.

"Whether Rashford can keep up his form is another thing, especially if he signs a new contract. We've had many players in recent years who fell off massively after signing a big contract.

The standard that has been set at Arsenal for our legends is one that is far higher than Xhaka‚Äôs performances for us across his time here. Even this season. 

A major team accomplishment like winning the title doesn‚Äôt really move him into the ‚Äúlegend‚Äù conversation as an individual, but it does perhaps change his legacy from being a liability to someone who came of age and made the necessary contributions to help the team when it mattered.

Don't know, we don't really know what Arteta's preference order will be when it comes to the 6. Would Jorginho be 3rd choice behind Rice there, or the primary backup after Partey, we'll have to see. 

But if Jorginho is to be 3rd choice, as to why he would be ok with that, I'm just speculating here, but I think for him this Arsenal stay is primarily about working with Arteta.

He's winding down his career, so he'll do more mentorship for younger players, may look to do some coaching badges etc., this stint will help him learn Arteta's methods. 

So this move to Arsenal may be less about this stage of his career, and more about preparation for the next stage as a coach.

"That is just absolutely not true in any sense of the word.

There is no metric that shows this. Results don't. Things like average shots per game, shots against per game, expected goals, expected goals against, average possession.

"You're right, I've noticed those too. And the Eddie thing at this point it's comical how he has to prove himself every match to some of these people.

"Should be available today. Anyway with Potter agree to sell Jorginho to us simply means he is thinking 4231 with Enzo  as pivot.

You know a real potential issue with this whole thing is chelsea just scattergunned a bunch of talent with no coherent strategy and really wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Potter was less than involved.

Quantified improvement.",Arsenal,Yes,j71208w,t1_j711ase
"I mean he's only played in the Ukranian league and a few effective cup finals in the CL.

The premier league is the fastest league and as a derby match both teams were trying to make things happen too fast and constantly losing the ball.

"Most of our big commercial streams are locked in on current terms for many more years. Success will obviously matter when it comes to renewing, but they would be considering long term trends and projections.

"Ask yourself if Arteta is completely satisfied with our present 'top of the league standard' performances, or whether he's said repeatedly and emphatically that there is room for improvement.

Then compare Xhaka's performance to √òdegaard's, and ask yourself whether Arteta would start √òdegaard and his clone across the top of our midfield, or bench one of them for Xhaka.

I would also point out that Xhaka's performance as one of our pair advanced 8s has not been entirely consistent this season. Compare his attacking contributions in our first 12 PL matches to our last 7; lately, his output has regressed to his historic levels, most notably the same as an advanced 8 in the back half of last season.

He did improve along the lines Mikel demanded, over the summer and especially in those first dozen matches, and thus was not replaced; it remains to be seen what will happen over the back half of this season and next summer-- but if you're going to talk standards, √òdegaard is the standard there.",Arsenal,Yes,j72k78w,t1_j71shzl

"Well I would dispute the idea that Tierney is a ""big player"" cause right now he's a mixed bag and not someone we want to be playing a lot. Even in his latest performance against City he was our worst player yet escaped a lot of criticisms cause people would rather shit on Lokonga.

Where the difference lies though is playstyle. Brentford are direct and counter attacking while Brighton are possession-based. Could Brentford's playstyle be limiting them? Or is Newcastle proof that they could go further?

Brighton becoming a bit of a feeder club for top clubs due to similar playstyle, while Brentford have been pretty inactive in transfer market last couple seasons, which will pay dividends in the end?

I don't know why we don't go all in on Bellingham this summer, especially if we win the EPL or go down to the wire with Man City for the title.  
  
Financials:

Assume six year contract, keep five years, sell.

Bellingham: buy for 150M, wages 300k per week, sell for 100M at age 24. 

Rice: buy for 80M, wages 200k per week, sell for 20M at age 29.

Those financials work out roughly about the same net expense. 

So we have competition from City and Liverpool. So what. With the core of Bellingham, Saka, Jesus, Saliba, Odegaard we firmly are a top five team in the world for the next several years. He's got England team homies with him: Saka, Ramsdale, White. Arteta is obviously playing a very compelling style of football.

One of Xhaka/Partey : This is purely based on the talk about us wanting both Caicedo and Rice. Assuming that does happen and seeing that Jorginho might still be around for a year, there's probably no way we would have Xhaka, Partey, Jorginho, Caicedo and Rice all on the same squad.

Arsenal: Leno, Bellerin, Sokratis, Luiz, Saka (at LB), Torreira, Xhaka, Ozil, Pepe, Laca, Auba",Arsenal,Yes,j6wj9vp,t1_j6w6srk
Actually what antics does jorginho has? He has his share of defensive blunders and any slow player in the prem is always gonna be exposed and memed but its not like he got sent off regularly like xhaka did or riled up the opposition like richarlison. Its azpilicueta i have a problem with from chelsea.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w9pzf,t1_j6w8yrc
BFG making all the kids in the academy feel extra safe and sheltered.,Arsenal,Yes,j6xdfaa,t1_j6xcvc1
Finishing above us in our banter years is their trophy. Those lot are completely ambitionless,Arsenal,Yes,j6zbldx,t1_j6z9ubt
Expressions is the only good thing about spurs,Arsenal,Yes,j6zqjmu,t1_j6z9ubt
I‚Äôm certainly interested to see how he does under Arteta instead of boring Chelsea,Arsenal,Yes,j6wv9u7,t1_j6wswxx
"Jorginho is elit regista. Always rate him during Sarriball and last Euro. He is cheat code on possession football. As long as Saliba Gabriel and White cover him, his pace deficiency should be covered.

Hope Arteta rekindled his form. This could be the case like when Pirlo was released by Milan to Juventus. Jorginho might be our most important transfer after all. I can somehow, smell it from afar.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wxndj,t1_j6wswxx
"I think we group him in with other Chelsea signings but fail to properly understand what we need from them. Cech was supposed to close the gap to the top of the league, Luiz was supposed to replace our captain who forced his way out, Jorginho just has to replace Elneny ffs. (Lets ignore Willian for this sake lol)",Arsenal,Yes,j6x2u75,t1_j6wswxx
Balogun to score a hattrick at the toilet bowl next season,Arsenal,Yes,j6we715,t1_j6wdwbr
"You've always got your work cut out for you haven't you, people always be doubting Eddie whenever they can.

He's proven himself enough times at this point I think lol",Arsenal,Yes,j6w9zpx,t1_j6w9vuj
"People always prefer the unknowns, because you barely watch them bar stats and highlights, you‚Äôre only really judging them from their highs, compared to players you know more about.

Same with someone like Caicedo vs Jorginho, we all know who Jorginho is so can be hyper fixated on his weaknesses, but people barely know anything about Caicedo so prefer him despite being the worse player (short term).",Arsenal,Yes,j6wadyp,t1_j6w9vuj
lmao I remember at the start of last season when everyone was like 'Balogun has to start' then we got battered by Brentford and no one said a word about it again,Arsenal,Yes,j6wcnub,t1_j6w9vuj
"Fucking annoying

Until Flo is scoring at a regular rate in the PL I will not perceive him as better than Eddie.

He might be, but we don‚Äôt have enough evidence yet",Arsenal,Yes,j6wcuxk,t1_j6w9vuj
Your defence is in trouble,Arsenal,Yes,j6wdkly,t1_j6wdg3t
"Boehly needs a kick in the head, guy is notoriously an asshole",Arsenal,Yes,j6xft5y,t1_j6x9hfl
literally one older couple who live near Stamford Bridge stopped their whole stadium rebuild on account of their light rights. Be surprised if Boehly could get it done,Arsenal,Yes,j6xa43s,t1_j6x9hfl
NYT is tier 1 for sports. They mainly do investigative reporting so not much is current but what they say is the truth or was the truth.,Arsenal,Yes,j6xhi7c,t1_j6x9hfl
"Leeds felt more like mental. It was insane. All of a sudden, players were all shit lol. Tactically, we had them on the hinges for the first half. 

United was a balanced game. We finish better, we win.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ye3vc,t1_j6y1bfy
Leeds is the only time this year where we‚Äôve been outplayed. We were better than utd at OT imo.,Arsenal,Yes,j6yh88i,t1_j6y1bfy
"In fact the Leeds game we were beaten tactically. And i must say that was the craziest pressing game I saw in my 59 yrs, how did they manage that intensity I was left speechless.",Arsenal,Yes,j6y4vx3,t1_j6y1bfy
"Nah, we got found out in the Leeds game. Lucky to escape there with a point let alone three. Other than that one game though, I agree.",Arsenal,Yes,j6y5nmo,t1_j6y1bfy
"I know everyone is mentioning the Leeds game but I felt we scored at the right times against Brighton too, they played really well and if not for the offside goal I reckon they would have got a draw.",Arsenal,Yes,j6z9pgf,t1_j6y1bfy
"It's the fact that everyone's been trying to put us down ***""oh they haven't played anyone serious yet""*** to ***""they will start to crumble without Jesus post WC""*** to whatever else shit prediction there is next. We just keep on going like an unstoppable train W after W and it's tasty AF :)",Arsenal,Yes,j6wh0vq,t1_j6wgh4w
"IF we sell Balogun anywhere, we 100% need to have a buyback clause or at least first refusal.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wf6uf,t1_j6w8e0h
We can always move Jesus to RW. Saves us a shit ton of cash as well.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w8idh,t1_j6w8e0h
"Gabriel did clean it up after the Leeds game. Some Saliba mistakes in the same time but most of them didn't result in goals.

I think it's fine, we are playing a highline and they are both young. Most CBs need experience to become better.",Arsenal,Yes,j6woht3,t1_j6wntql
"Oh that's the exciting part of it all. Our performance has been consistent, it doesn't feel like any sort of short term uptick.

If we continue to perform like the 1st half of the season, then we're winning the league. 

I would say that our squad is stronger after transfers than before the transfer window opened.
Whereas City are weaker.

Obviously a big game coming up against them that could make a big impact",Arsenal,Yes,j6woxa1,t1_j6wntql
"Only 5 matches out of 19 have we conceded an open play goal when the game has been within a goal difference (Brighton/Leicester up 2+). 8 meaningful open play goals allowed, only 3 of those did we not answer with a goal of our own. Pretty remarkable when you think about it.

UTD (A) they scored 3 nice goals even if we were a bit naive and had Sambi, Pool (H) they had a nice 1 and a kinda janky/mistake 1, Soton (A) they opened us up for 1, Fulham (H) big mistake, and UTD (H) they scored 1 of individual brilliance and we made an error on a corner for another. 
 
The fact that we're in the spot we're in while making errors is super encouraging. We'll never cut them out totally, but it also means there's probably not a correction coming either.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wyky0,t1_j6wntql
"They got lucky with a series of youth products. 

Obviously Kane in particular but Bale was massive for them as well. I genuinely think Kane is massively underrated. Once he goes that club goes into mid table. 

Getting a striker like that for free has basically elevated them way above where they‚Äôd be for a decade.",Arsenal,Yes,j6zsgr1,t1_j6zootu
Their expectations are too high... Another problem is their rivals are doing better.,Arsenal,Yes,j6zropy,t1_j6zootu
"To be fair they're in our early banter years.

Nice stadium, top four, pretty football, most expensive tickets in the league, making a profit every year and we got shit on it for not winning trophies.

Now thy haven't got the pretty football and to be fair to them they've got the Greatest Striker in Premier League History ^TM and they've wasted him. I understand the issues because they're on a footing that should be bringing in something other than just top four.",Arsenal,Yes,j6zrjt6,t1_j6zootu
You know what the big difference has been: poch and Kane. They‚Äôre now stuck in a weird win now or rebuild cycle.,Arsenal,Yes,j6zqb7x,t1_j6zootu
[removed],Arsenal,Yes,j6zox49,t1_j6zootu
I think we can all agree that we are addicted to watch Arsenal games and days without it are like when we are on withdrawal symptoms,Arsenal,Yes,j6xj548,t1_j6xhp3m
"I know people don't want to hear this, but I didn't really care about the FA cup match too much, and so it feels like we've gone two weeks without a game.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xmzex,t1_j6xhp3m
"because the fa cup match against city felt a bit more like a warmup match than a ""we gotta win this"" match. it was also on a friday.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xi226,t1_j6xhp3m
"And Gary neville is expecting united to finish ahead of us. He's also wrong 100% of the time.

Now what?",Arsenal,Yes,j6wpt81,t1_j6wpp7e
"Me too. I just hope he does above everyone‚Äôs expectations and gets a new contract. The talent is obviously there, he just needs to apply it.


It will help us to not worry about the RW position with Saka and him come summer.",Arsenal,Yes,j6z6n0w,t1_j6yxzst
ohhhh Martinelli dodododo dodoo,Arsenal,Yes,j6zdq0t,t1_j6zdf9m

"Lewis was annoyingly good against us, think theyve unearthed a gem there",Arsenal,Yes,j6w4myu,t1_j6w46xe
Waiting for a Mitro masterclass,Arsenal,Yes,j6x1uk2,t1_j6wxcvx
"Honestly I think they'll improve enough to where they'll come within something like 3 points of top 4. It'll be close, and if Potter isn't the right guy, they might even still have time to get something out of the UCL with a better manager. Maybe I'm overreacting, but they did it in 2012 while being shit in the league.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wzwg5,t1_j6wxcvx

Spurs have failed us once already. Only Spurs can let even their rivals down,Arsenal,Yes,j6z7434,t1_j6z63ke
"Had a spurs fan at my gym tell me he hopes spurs lose vs city to ""keep the pressure on"" and It took more strength than my max lift to not laugh in his face",Arsenal,Yes,j6zcble,t1_j6z63ke
Emery is gonna do us no favour when we go to villa park either lol.,Arsenal,Yes,j6zj5qj,t1_j6z63ke
I love that the only thing spurs and United can now do is take points off our rivals.,Arsenal,Yes,j6z6xbp,t1_j6z63ke

"We have a better start than any season in their history.

Guess their entire history is a disaster.",Arsenal,Yes,j6z78xm,t1_j6z60sl
"both having good seasons.

Saka is on pace to beat Rashford's league stats in the season Rashford was 21yrs old.  Rashford isn't.....",Arsenal,Yes,j6z7rgn,t1_j6z60sl
We‚Äôre still firmly in EL contention lol,Arsenal,Yes,j6z77ft,t1_j6z60sl
"Why would I give a shit? We're fighting for the title only losers care about individual accomplishments
Btw Manutd's only output is Rashford we saw that when we played against them 
We have goal and assists spread all over our squad",Arsenal,Yes,j6z985f,t1_j6z60sl
Just think of it as another week closer to a fully fit ESR and Jesus,Arsenal,Yes,j70d35b,t1_j70a22i
"The academy‚Äôs been great for a while but taking loans more seriously and hiring a guy to oversee them is now maxing out that potential. Flo, Patino, BNC, Nuno, Trusty all looking like helping the Arsenal first team or getting us a big fee.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wghkq,t1_j6wddra
"A few people whinged about the wages, but that contract was an excellent bit of business.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xiafy,t1_j6xguou
"Almost lost Balogun aswell, did very well to keep them both",Arsenal,Yes,j6xh1vz,t1_j6xguou
"I know you're thinking of those alisson to salah beauts but that's just not really how we play... Liverpool love to play quickly on the counter so that suits them, for us we love to advance the ball up the field pass by pass, cutting through the opponents lines when our players see an opportunity.

Would be nice to score like that tho I guess lol",Arsenal,Yes,j6z2qf8,t1_j6z0zws
More nervous that Saka is going to get hacked to pieces by Dyche‚Äôs horde.,Arsenal,Yes,j6z3pv3,t1_j6z18yg
Probably because we haven't won at Goodison in our last 4 trips...,Arsenal,Yes,j6z368d,t1_j6z18yg

We suck at Everton away that‚Äôs why,Arsenal,Yes,j6zr6wn,t1_j6z18yg
"I am always wary about new manager bounces. 

That said we absolutely should beat them. I was worried they‚Äôd make a load of signings on deadline day and that didn‚Äôt haooe.",Arsenal,Yes,j6z2ffa,t1_j6z18yg
We lost to them last year. This team that we have is on a mission to redeem themselves from their mistakes last year.,Arsenal,Yes,j6zmfxx,t1_j6z18yg
"Every game feels like a cup final. Any game could turn into a slip up and if its not a tough one like City or Newcastle then it feels really bad afterwards.

It feels great to be nervous about every game, 2-3 years ago I couldn't care less. Now we care because we're competing to take it all home",Arsenal,Yes,j6z2aur,t1_j6z18yg
It's a banana slip game in many ways.,Arsenal,Yes,j6z44e9,t1_j6z18yg
"To ease your mind, they‚Äôre really bad. Dyche or Frank they can‚Äôt score. We‚Äôre gonna smoke them and you‚Äôll get to happily watch the replay stress free.",Arsenal,Yes,j6z52dj,t1_j6z18yg
"Good for him to learn from Viera, too",Arsenal,Yes,j6z7eeh,t1_j6z32qn
This could be interpreted in a certain way lol,Arsenal,Yes,j6z71wq,t1_j6z32qn
"yeah of course

Untied fans were yapping about it, while having CR7 in their squad.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xrdcu,t1_j6xqum9
Laughable if you look at r/soccer comments to bissouma‚Äôs case https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/vninbr/yves_bissouma_is_cleared_of_sexual_assault,Arsenal,Yes,j6xt8u9,t1_j6xqum9
"Partey is a non-topic if Arsenal are 6th in the League, or if the shit club's - who have a large presence online - were performing on the pitch. The booing in away stadiums ends the moment Arsenal no longer threaten their club's ambitions.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xslvs,t1_j6xqum9
"even any attempts at trying to bring some nuance into the debate is met with them claiming im condoning rape. 

There is so much incredibly shady shit that is happening in football, so much they could focus on even Messi would be a target if they really cared, but they mainly care about point scoring and trying to diminsh what arsenal is currently doing.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xvla8,t1_j6xqum9

My work wants me to travel to the main offices in a different country in the coming weeks. Told them I cant go if it's that week. No way I'm going to be out doing some team get together dinner the night we batter city at the Emirates under the lights.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wifs9,t1_j6wekjb
"I'm hoping I'll be inbetween a new job and my current job by then, the timing might work out",Arsenal,Yes,j6wffbn,t1_j6wekjb

"Twitter is an absolute dungeon. Especially now since Elon Musk came on the scene, the algorithm seems to show me more and more extreme/ concerning content. Have only kept my account to refresh on Fabrizio Romano‚Äôs page during transfer windows.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xb526,t1_j6xapmw
"I have definitely thought about it. Especially in relation to a lot of shit you see on twitter. Especially since covid, so much misinformation and bullshit spreads so quickly and is believed by so many without so much as a second thought that it seems utterly futile to even consider starting a dialogue with them in the hopes that they'll see how ridiculous their beliefs are.

People can spout insane bullshit in 280 characters that would take a fucking essay to begin to refute.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xbbt5,t1_j6xapmw
"Life is far far better if all of social media was deleted. That's when one will find true zen. I find it funny when people on social media criticise drug addicts when social media is a drug itself. Either way Reddit or Heroin, your soul still being destroyed.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xijof,t1_j6xapmw
"I‚Äôd recommend following who you like (don‚Äôt let it get out of hand where you‚Äôre on Twitter all day keeping up), and don‚Äôt look at replies unless you‚Äôre truly interested. The big accounts are absolute cesspools of weirdos but legit analysis is usually responded to by legit analysis as well. Remember that it‚Äôs ok for others to have a differing viewpoint and not to get invested in it",Arsenal,Yes,j6xcimh,t1_j6xapmw
He was close to joining Forest. He is clearly not a top level player anymore.,Arsenal,Yes,j6xls9k,t1_j6xjqxk
That contract renewal followed by the dip in form is gonna be hilarious,Arsenal,Yes,j6xwnim,t1_j6xweq2
Haha I keep seeing people parading around his stats in all competitions to make him out to be the best winger in Europe. Fucking ridiculous.,Arsenal,Yes,j6xy1q2,t1_j6xweq2
"I keep bringing this up to my united friends and they choose to ignore it.

The biggest game they‚Äôve had in weeks was the palace match. They had a chance to put themselves in the title race and Rashford played like shit and made several wrong decisions in the final third.",Arsenal,Yes,j6y9ufd,t1_j6xweq2
It is not like he is doing nothing in the league. The man is having a good season,Arsenal,Yes,j6y39la,t1_j6xweq2
There was a stat that Barca in effect paid for the stadium with our players who turned out to be flops (and 2 non-flops I‚Äôm still grumpy about).,Arsenal,Yes,j6wijxk,t1_j6wi0uv
I remember the meme (or joke as we used to call them back in the day) was that we sold them the gun without the bullets (RVP),Arsenal,Yes,j6wqdb8,t1_j6wi0uv
Using the inflation measures across all goods and services doesn't really account for the fact the football transfer market has inflated much faster.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wc44e,t1_j6wbxq0
"Football inflation does not work like that, transfer fees increase relative to increase in the revenue of clubs

Transfer fees are probably similar to 30 years ago in comparison to revenue, otherwise clubs would just have free money lying around if they didn't spend it on players",Arsenal,Yes,j6wca87,t1_j6wbxq0
The commercial growth of football teams probably doesn‚Äôt match the growth of transfer fees. Highbury use to give Arsenal about ¬£30 mil in revenues and now the Emirates gives us ¬£90 mil. Why everyone is probably agitating for the Super League.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wg8ov,t1_j6wbxq0
*breaks pool cue menacingly*,Arsenal,Yes,j6wf7j2,t1_j6wf4vr
Not straightaway. He'll go to Turkey or Qatar or something for some image rehab first.,Arsenal,Yes,j6x3jwa,t1_j6x2mj8
i think you are naive because prem and efl clubs are no strangers to signing and playing players accused of such crimes,Arsenal,Yes,j6x3bbn,t1_j6x2mj8
You don‚Äôt think Everton would? Lee Hughes literally killed someone and had a football League career,Arsenal,Yes,j6x3yi1,t1_j6x2mj8
Dude.. we literally have an accused player in our squad.,Arsenal,Yes,j6x3rgc,t1_j6x2mj8

"Yes, the suffering of Greenwood's victim was certainly worth it to slightly mud Gary Neville.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xx728,t1_j6xwkqu
Even after you correct for partisan fan base bias‚Ä¶the situations are objectively different. There‚Äôs really no comparison. There were receipts on Greenwood and he was duly indicted. Partey is (if reports are true) several steps behind that point procedurally.,Arsenal,Yes,j6zk5hu,t1_j6z5ij9
"Also worth bearing in mind that there's a decent chance Patino will be in the squad next season.

I have a suspicion Arteta is going to want to make himself a Right Zinchenko, so we could make a play for a very young, very promising midfielder he thinks he can shape at RB.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wcome,t1_j6wbjnl
"not when he‚Äôs on your side. if he takes a pen for us, man could do a front flip then shoot, as long as it goes in",Arsenal,Yes,j6zoc5m,t1_j6zmhb9

Tribalism really blinds people,Arsenal,Yes,j6x5c0k,t1_j6x412l
"To me, ESR feels like the odd one out in the attack and probably develops deeper into the LCM as has been suggested by many. We then have: Trossard, Martinelli, Jesus, Nketiah, Saka & Balogun.

Trossard and Jesus can both play across the front three, Balogun up front and LW, Martinelli LW, Saka both wings, Nketiah CF. Plenty of rotation opportunities and plenty of competition there.",Arsenal,Yes,j6we2ud,t1_j6wd1mg
It‚Äôs almost too many strikers given we play 4-3-3. One would get basically no minutes in the league unless we move Jesus out wide (which I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be against).,Arsenal,Yes,j6wdlke,t1_j6wd1mg
1 of them would barely play unless Jesus is moved to the wings.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wdcje,t1_j6wd1mg
"I‚Äôd be fine with that if Balogun was this finished article, but of all our options he needs the most minutes to develop. Bringing him back to start 10 games won‚Äôt be good for his development",Arsenal,Yes,j6wf2fa,t1_j6wd1mg

"He doesn't have much of an option and also Rashford is 25, in his prime. His body isn't developing like Saka so it's less of a risk.

Sancho if he even gets to 80% of his ability, should be a big player for the remainder of the season for them",Arsenal,Yes,j6wo2f6,t1_j6wnd2x
"Doesn't have a choice. Man United still have so much deadwood on the books so he has to make players like bruno and casemiro play every single game.

I can respect his strategy though, he knows united is not good enough to win the league this year so he's taking his shots at the domestic cups",Arsenal,Yes,j6wp9r1,t1_j6wnd2x
I hope so. Need more Arsenal players in there.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wvcte,t1_j6wrulc
"Man, if Jesus improves his finishing, he could be Balon D'Or good.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xejnk,t1_j6x4nlm
"Exactly the reason I always have doubts about Nketiah in our system. He is a Poacher by nature, but we need more involvement in the build up and link up.

"I mean, I love Reiss, and really want him to succeed here-- but 'manager talks up player he wants to lure' isn't the best way to support that.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xfg8b,t1_j6xeucn
"Fans can have a bit of hoarding issue. Keep all the good players and deal with the problem of minutes distribution later. Funnily enough during our ""this team is shit"" phase fans wanted a complete purging with barely enough players to field a starting 11. 

All things considered, we need to be realistic. We can't say ""just move x player to y position when we need to give them minutes"" for every player that deserves to be playing more.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wl3pw,t1_j6wig1z
I'd rather play the absolute worst teams possible whilst Chelsea keeps drawing the best teams possible. We can beat up the UCL teams next year.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wyfrr,t1_j6wwsef
no thanks man. I want to play easy teams as to not muddy or stress our rotation with the league so we can push for a PL title. I'll take a final against a big team after the league is wrapped uo,Arsenal,Yes,j6wz1am,t1_j6wwsef

"100%, in a title race + CL you‚Äôre starting your best available players every game, just as Arteta has shown to do. 

Would be harsh for him to go from playing every game in France, to maybe 10 starts max for us. Nketiah has started 14 games for us, 6 being EL which won‚Äôt be available minutes next season, and 5 in the prem, which is purely due to Jesus getting injured.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wkxdn,t1_j6wjo1x

"Or maybe not.. A few differences. 

- He had a low release clause. His price was capped around a figure.

- He's a bit more lightweight and less drilled for physical football. He's more technical than fight.

That means there is no way he goes for all that. 

Enzo had a huge release clause. Mudryk's price would have been a cool ¬£60M hadn't it been for Antony. Caicedo's numbers were more of us being desperate and Brighton issuing fuck off prices.",Arsenal,Yes,j6yocys,t1_j6ylsvj

"Both are at the age they need to be playing competitively week in week out. Neither should be riding the bench. Neither should be a third choice.

Why would we rotate against Brentford. They are one of the stronger sides this season. Especially against top 6 teams,Arsenal,Yes,j6w6uer,t1_j6w6kc8
"I'd rotate *slightly* for Brentford, but try to blow them away early then get in rest defense/sub out players.

You're just never getting that opportunity vs City and the intensity of that match makes Villa maybe the biggest banana peel of the year.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w6sf8,t1_j6w6kc8
[deleted],Arsenal,Yes,j6w6pnp,t1_j6w6kc8
"Brentford is very compact at the back, they just won't let u get into the middle. Yeah ithink Trossard can be useful, also Jorgi. Both are good against low block.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w8yep,t1_j6w6kc8
Rotating against Brentford is a stupid choice especially when you consider their big 6 record,Arsenal,Yes,j6w6xjr,t1_j6w6kc8
Probably rest both of them against Villa would be my guess.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w701m,t1_j6w6kc8
Not a big fan of the idea but if I was going to I'd pick the Brentford game as its a home game.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w71t1,t1_j6w6kc8
"I'd be very hesitant to:

Brentford's not a side we'd want to underestimate. As it stands they've been a stumbling block for other top 6 sides. Perhaps depending on the game state, say if we are comfortably up in the second half, we could sub Tierney / Jorginho on for them to see out the game so Zinny/Partey can get some rest.

For City we'd definitely have to put out a full strength side. We'll probably have to go full intensity till the final whistle blows regardless of game state - they can score 4 goals in a half if they catch a side napping, and I see it being a very close and tightly contested game.

For Villa, they are a resurgent side. For how much Emery has been memed he has been very competent at playing to his squad's strength since he's been back to the PL. I wouldn't rest Zinny and Partey here either. I'd start them and them off if the game state allows, similar to at Brentford.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w76zv,t1_j6w6kc8

"Liverpool. They'd been so dominant against us, and for us to take it to them that second half like we did and find a winner, I think this group knew then that they can win any and every game.

But honestly since preseason the vibes and confidence have been so high. They didn't lose any of those matches and smoked Chelsea/Sevilla. If you count that and the winter warm up they've gone 29-2-5. Only the UTD loss did we not rotate.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wu30f,t1_j6wrpwc
Somewhat ignoring the spirit of the question  but I think it was the way last season ended that created this monster.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wu466,t1_j6wrpwc

You've just very neatly illustrated the rather significant differences between bail in the US and bail in the UK-- to say nothing of pre-charge 'police' bail.,Arsenal,Yes,j6xegsf,t1_j6xcvoe
"I mean to be frank your entire comment is at best misleading

While presumption of innocence does place the burden of proving guilt to the state, to say it‚Äôs ‚Äúsimply a way to shift the burden of proving your guilt to the a prosecution‚Äù completely ignores the historical context of this right, the importance placed on the right at law (it being constitutionally enshrined in many countries) and also ignores that it not only places the burden on the government but equally if not more importantly requires the state to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In other words, it means precisely that the government has to give you the ‚Äúbenefit of the doubt‚Äù. 

Kind of a sus comment tbh",Arsenal,Yes,j6xfznn,t1_j6xcvoe

I'm not sure anyone has praised him as a person. As of yet there isn't any new information or a trial yet so I guess that's why it's gone a little quiet on that front. I'm sure once a trail or new evidence/developments happen it will be a discussion point again,Arsenal,Yes,j6xln1o,t1_j6xkx9z
"What has shifted? He is a good player and this season has been crucial to our success. I don't see much praise towards him beyond that though. 

At my local supporter's club, I don't see any Partey shirts. The new shirts are great and popular, i see plenty of new ones from this year (especially the black ones). despite partey being such an important on the pitch part of our success, i don't see anyone spending the money to get a partey shirt. xhaka? yes. saka? yes. jesus? yes. odegaard? yes. White? yes. saliba? yes. 

I think this is intentional. Most people are clearly uncomfortable being supportive of partey beyond saying that he had a good game.

One reason I desperately want someone like Rice to come in and be the new 6 is so we aren't in a position to extend Partey for additional years. Because I don't want him at the club, but recognize its not the club's position to be judge, jury, and executioner for these things. Meanwhile I've never seen a club terminate a contract based on claims that did not ultimately bring a conviction, doing so would be an interesting precedent to set though. 

The club also knows that partey isn't worth promoting, and doesn't emphasize him nearly as much as you would see for a player in his position and with his importance. He is our second highest earning player based on a contract signed before this happened. Looking through their twitter postings I'm trying to find the last time Partey was featured on anything outside of a team celebration picture. 

The closest thing I can find is a training photo posted on December 16th that Partey was the focus of. But he's never interviewed, never advertised for apparel or otherwise, and i can't find the last time he was the guy on the team sheet announcement image.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xqkc8,t1_j6xkx9z
"Feeling uncomfortable is completely reasonable.

To put it in a different light, Thomas himself may be guilty as sin or innocent as a babe in arms, and either way, *he* would feel uncomfortable about this situation as well. It's not a comfortable thing; what comforts there may be are generally cold.

For my part, I would simply like idiots to stop stating as facts things which are blatantly untrue.

edit: My favourite one so far isn't even the United fan who said Thomas 'had been found guilty', but the Chelsea fan who confidently stated that 'Occam's Razor' entailed that Thomas was 'likely a rapist'-- in the same breath he misstated not only the principle he had failed to understand and applied like an ape with a calculator, and which wasn't even William of Ockham's to begin with, but the facts of the situation.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xnq39,t1_j6xkx9z
"True. 

And the wildest things I see continuously is this unrepentant hunger for 'more solid evidence', deliberately ignoring the very sensitive nature of SA, and how it, by its very nature, tends to produce he-said-she-said situations in court. Partey's messages where he directly admitted to SA (>!where he admits to putting his penis in the victim's mouth whilst she was asleep !<), are probably not enough to indict him in court, especially considering his social and financial status, but the only thing that means is that the justice system is fundamentally broken.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xlyrg,t1_j6xkx9z
"Partey, as it currently stands, is innocent. So take your bullshit elsewhere.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xp5df,t1_j6xkx9z
"Nah I'm with you. I haven't forgotten and don't intend to anytime soon. These clubs can have their priorities, but I have mine. I still feel weird about Raheem Sterling, and his abuse case was over a decade ago.",Arsenal,Yes,j6y92yr,t1_j6xkx9z
"I mean if the way this sub treats Partey bothers you, there's no need to keep coming back.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xqlk9,t1_j6xkx9z

Weirdly there‚Äôs been more positive noise about saliba signing than saka. I normally wouldn‚Äôt be worried about saka and i would still fairly confidently say he‚Äôll sign but madrid and sort of man city (mahrez is getting older) having holes at RW makes me a little nervous.,Arsenal,Yes,j6ykwaj,t1_j6yjhnx

"Doesn't make any sense for either not to extend. Hopefully the next 3 years are amazing and they can live in London playing for one of the best teams in the world. Could play out a contract and still be 25. 

And even if somehow things go bad at Arsenal, both have the talent to go anywhere in the world with still a lot of their career in front of them.

"I have no doubt both will sign. Great city, stadium, fan atmosphere, squad cohesion, great support from team mates, coach and back room staff. Team willing to show ambition to sign players, there‚Äôs just too many positives.",Arsenal,Yes,j6yus8h,t1_j6yjhnx
"*""I get that. And it's not about owning anyone. But when you spend hours travelling for an interview, then spend time transcribing, writing, etc. It gets a tad frustrating when you just see it picked apart like that in a matter of minutes. But I know, that's just the way it is.""*

"I think the biggest hold up is that 300k a week. That would destroy our wage structure right after (hopefully) tying down Saka, Martinelli, and saliba. Potentially upsetting our starts as they look at this newcomer making more than them. 

Bellingham will want that 300k+ a week, I don‚Äôt doubt that, but I don‚Äôt see Arsenal being willing to pay that. 

If we win the league, and we go for him, I foresee us offering 200-250k and then someone else beating our contract. I would LOVE Bellingham, but I just don‚Äôt see the club matching the salary he would want/demand",Arsenal,Yes,j6xj6nw,t1_j6xil3j
"150m is more than double our all time record transfer. No way we‚Äôll be spending anywhere near that for any player, nor should we.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xj7se,t1_j6xil3j
"Not a good look for a new signing to come in and immediately become the club‚Äôs highest earner, resetting the wage structure. 

If all squad members who‚Äôve been giving every ounce of themselves for this project resign, only to make ¬£50-¬£100k/week less than a newly signed 19 year old, there stands to be some malcontent in the dressing room. If they sign Jude before extending key players, they‚Äôll immediately demand a bump in their compensation. 

I don‚Äôt think a > ¬£300k/week earner joins the squad, until √òdegaard gets an extension in the same neighborhood.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xjt8f,t1_j6xil3j
"Footballistically, Rice seems to fit like a glove in the side, whereas Bellingham would need a bit of adaptation and you lose a lot of his abilities if you play him as a 6. 

There's also more data on Rice than Bellingham, and less risk of adaptation issues (e.g. Sancho). Arteta/Edu have shown a strong preference for Premier league experience when it comes to expensive transfers. 

Last thing, financial outlay means money down now, not how much we recoup at the end of contract. We could potentially get a Rice and Caicedo/Zubamendi for the price of a Bellingham. And we need two players to replace Xhaka+Partey in the near future. 

Ideally we go for Rice AND Bellingham, but realistically Rice and one other is a more achievable target.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xkmwu,t1_j6xil3j
"I'd love Bellingham but can't help feel he's destined to join Real Madrid. On a quick glance, he'd fit there well as they are a counter attacking team that would give him a lot of freedom.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xk2xx,t1_j6xil3j
"Right now, unlike 2 years ago, we are able to do way better than Locatelli",Arsenal,Yes,j6xv4ol,t1_j6xuuf3

"They don't all have to play as strikers. That's the key part everyone is missing. Jesus can play LW and RW and Balogun can play off the left. Even Trossard can play as a striker. The players are interchangeable and can play multiple positions inside a single game, nevermind across different matches. Players will fluidly rotate and pop up randomly and the opposition won't know who to mark and where they're going to go, with runners from midfield able to go both inside and outside, goals from all over the park. How do you stop this?

That's the whole point. Organised chaos.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wfpli,t1_j6wf58k
We will not have enough games to split between them. Every top team itw who plays with one striker has two strikers in their squad.

"It's kinda weird people find it so hard to believe he did what he did. Like he hasn't been accused of being a violent rapist; the accusation is more that he just doesn't understand consent and tried to impose himself on someone who was sleeping. I mean...that's completely believable.

Our case looks bad because there are multiple cases but are there hard evidence?  
It‚Äôs hard. I hope the police does something about it, it certainly looks bad. But if they drop it for lack of evidence then it‚Äôs tough to say he did it.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xbfxe,t1_j6x8m1o
I'm gonna get downvoted to eternity but Partey's case isn't going anywhere. Heck even Greenwood is going to walk out scot-free legally. It doesn't matter if he did or didn't do it.

They could also pursue a mutual termination - which we have done a lot in the past few years - which he‚Äôd likely take if he wants to play football soon.

You also underestimate the implications of playing him. I can see boycotts, withdrawing of sponsorship etc. It‚Äôs not as easy as you may think to make the decision. The leaked videos and audio are pretty damning regardless of the conclusion of the criminal prosecution.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ynem2,t1_j6ymeq3

"Tierney: Maybe, but I think he sticks around for CL football

Turner: Nope. His US role isn't under any threat.

"Zero chance we sell partey or xhaka. No chance. We'd sooner sell jorginho.

Also not selling Turner. He's a perfect backup keeper and is an arsenal fan. He's happy we're happy.

I agree on Tierney. And holding. Elneny if someone wants him. We'll probably get 40-50m selling runarsson. Lokonga and nuno probably end up sold. Pepe will be sold if anyone wants him, I feel like it's more likely there that we just do a mutual termination though.",Arsenal,Yes,j6zo8yk,t1_j6zmo3x

If you think Nketiah has been playing as a penalty box striker you've not been paying close enough attention. his all round game is solid. Only big advantage I can really give Jesus is some of his central dribbling and final ball,Arsenal,Yes,j6w7g4t,t1_j6w6ut8
"At the beginning of the season Jesus was at a different level from everyone else.

Just was clearly performing above even Partey, Saka, Odegaard etc.

"This isn't really true.

Napoli have spent that price twice in recent years on a striker, and will again is Osimhen leaves. Higuain and Osimhen cost that much.

Atletico has spent that much (infl adjusted) on a striker like 7 times in recent times? (Aguero, Jackson Martinez, Felix, Costa, Falcao, Morata)

Lille will spend whatever Jonathon David goes for. It won't be 70, but 40 won't be an issue.

Red Bull have plenty of money.

Milan will have whatever money Leao is sold for.

Juventus have no problem with creative accounting.

And few people are saying 70m is nailed on, but they are every bit as good of a prospect as players going in that range. Plus they are not foreign/count as homegrown.

"> United are within their right or bring back Greenwood

ANy club is within their rights to play anyone.

However the club will have a code of conduct for all players and if what was released doesn't contravene that code of conduct then there's something severely wrong with it.

I doubt there is a company in the country that wouldn't sack someone for what he did and comparing it to Partey where there is no material evidence in the public domain is disingenous, there's no way the club wouldn't have doen exacly as United did if they'd seen that and I'd honestly see them dumping him as I'm pretty sure Man U will with Greenwood.",Arsenal,Yes,j6zwv4r,t1_j6zuuus

"Yeah they could have achieved more when they had a really good squad. But there are teams like Villa, Everton, West Ham etc.. who were similarly sized to them who never took that next step into the top 6 the way spurs have.

"This is a fair take.  
I am gutted we didn‚Äôt win the league with Ozil and Sanchez but we had some odd names to deal with.  
  
Looking at the amount of talent they had in their squad made me laugh hard, I had forgotten some of the big names.  
But Kane, Son and Lloris are getting past their prime soon.  
Lloris is not a superstar but he‚Äôs been consistently good.  
They‚Äôll struggle to replace any of them.  
  
That said, I am (unfortunately) a fan of Richarlison, I think he‚Äôll play well as a #9, he‚Äôs being wasted on the wing.  
Best thing they could hope for is if Kane breaks record and fucks off then Richarlison assumes the 9 role and plays well.  
If Kane stays they‚Äôll piss off Richarlison and struggle to find a replacement for Kane when he eventually leaves.",Arsenal,Yes,j6zt5ti,t1_j6zrjt6

Good point on big accounts though, probably better to avoid those even if they do provide news or other important info, a lot of people trying to cause a stir under those",Arsenal,Yes,j6xg37w,t1_j6xcimh

What do u mean mate? Like u think he might go to an inverted fullback role sometime in the future? If so yeah I ain't seen him play at all lol but he seems to have the right attributes based on what I hear. Do u think we still sign Ndicka on a free in the summer now we got this guy? Or is this guy a replacement for Holding and we get Ndicka anyway? I remember heating he wants insane wages + Barca are interested so perhaps we went for this guy instead?,Arsenal,Yes,j70ruoy,t1_j70hvij

"The fee won‚Äôt be peanuts, all of the top 6 teams will be interested",Arsenal,Yes,j6y82mn,t1_j6y7bcg

"We're not changing formations, and Rice both won't be ready to inherit Thomas' mantle as our 6, and won't come here to sit on the bench until he is.

Thomas continues as the 6; Rice starts as an 8 while offering improved 6 cover until he's ready to run with it.

Basically, think of Rice as 'Mega Sambi'.",Arsenal,Yes,j6yeyjk,t1_j6ydrkd
Partey stays at 6. For now. We won‚Äôt shift back to a double pivot unless we‚Äôre in an injury crisis though (IMO).,Arsenal,Yes,j6yefbp,t1_j6ydrkd

"Well the fans were convinced we nearly lost him, and undoubtedly relationships were strained, but the messaging from both sides was always reiterating their commitment to eachother",Arsenal,Yes,j6w8946,t1_j6w7ehw
"You're probably right. Tbh I think he could have been useful to us last season but he wouldn't have got as much game time, as Gabriel and White were the established CB pairing at the time.

"I know you would sign Vlahovic in a heartbeat or even Osimhen if given the chance even when we already have Jesus and Nketiah.

"Not to speak for op, but that's not at all the implication I took away.

"That‚Äôs exactly what he wants.

"He does left exposed in the past, everyone knows his limitations. But with our inverted FB especially our RB White pushing so high up , Jorgi can only retreat a few yards, that would create a 212 back line with him in middle. We will still be exposed with a long ball over the top catching everyone by surprise, but then it's not Jorgi's problem, the entire backline is at fault.",Arsenal,Yes,j6yi41t,t1_j6y7zm8
He‚Äôs definitely not shit but he has some obvious weaknesses and gets exposed in space from time to time. His qualities on the ball are still really good he will always show for it and has good press resistance you guys got a good one,Arsenal,Yes,j6y9qak,t1_j6y7zm8
Sergio Biscuits,Arsenal,Yes,j6w7r3r,t1_j6w7dqw
"Funniest thing was people thinking, we get Caicedo for 80 then we get Rice for 100, no probs. Then when i ask, what's the risk with signing Jorginho, they said that signing Jorginho will prevent us from signing Rice. Insane takes.",Arsenal,Yes,j6yc8aa,t1_j6yakyf
"Of course opinions are allowed to change, but it should be based on evidence. The fact people were screeching about him signing, then slowly walking that back and saying he's now a good signing - despite not playing for us yet, mind - means they were being unnecessarily reactionary. 

I saw people on here saying this was the worst window ever and Edu should be physically attacked for George signing for us. People need to get a grip.",Arsenal,Yes,j6yhkjv,t1_j6ybkli
Their opinions haven‚Äôt changed based on anything they‚Äôve seen on the pitch their opinions are changing because it‚Äôs popular to do so now and that‚Äôs all they care about. They were v happy to lead an dumbass agenda against Gaspar when it suited them to do so.,Arsenal,Yes,j6yck60,t1_j6ybkli

"I'd be fine with KT and Trossard starting but seeing how we play without Partey worries me, even with Jorginho in the squad. He needs to start every PL game if he's healthy IMO, give Jorginho a run in the EL and see how he fits",Arsenal,Yes,j6w6xlk,t1_j6w6pnp

"Playing everyone 270 minutes won't happen and is a recipe for disaster.

I found Edu's valuation of players quite reasonable so far. Rice is more valuable in the market than Caicedo or Mudryk so I doubt he does that,Arsenal,Yes,j6y1rkm,t1_j6y0e25
Except Rice is worth about double what Caicedo is so that‚Äôs a pretty unlikely scenario.,Arsenal,Yes,j6y208t,t1_j6y0e25
"5 of our first XI were priority Edu targets he got signed. A sixth came because he set a valuation and moved on (Zinchenko).

I'd say he's lost out on 4 guys we really went after: Vlahovic, Mudryk, Raphina, Lisandro Martinez. 2 of those came down to the player choosing Juve/Barca over us. 2 of them he got outbid. Can't even say we've lost out on Caicedo yet because he hasn't been sold.

Long way to go yet, but if we do it I'm gonna relish in the fact people spent their time criticizing transfers that didn't happen over being thrilled about this squad that's assembled.",Arsenal,Yes,j6y4xx7,t1_j6y0e25

Kompany has turned Burnley around into a possession team and I'm sure it's built on similar positional play principles.

I share being uncomfortable about him. And if he ends up innocent I'd have understood being uncomfortable with him at the time.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xm99t,t1_j6xlixx
if martin √∏degaard was a murderer but got away on a technicality would you still support him?,Arsenal,Yes,j6xpiie,t1_j6xlixx
"Saka is def gonna wait until the summer. If he wins us the title he‚Äôll get a huge contract. 

I really can‚Äôt see why Saka would want to leave for City. He‚Äôs at the club he loves and they have the foundation to compete for the biggest trophies. He‚Äôll sign in the summer when his value is highest. Could be something like ¬£300k",Arsenal,Yes,j6ymwbl,t1_j6ykwaj
"Yeah I‚Äôve noticed that as well. 

My hope is that it‚Äôs just sakas agent being a dick. He is notorious for it.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ys9m0,t1_j6ykwaj
"This is it. 

If Arsenal won the league this year, then competed in the CL for a year (securing it again in 24/25), gave √òdegaard a ¬£300k/week extension in Summer 2024, then they could pursue a high wage earner, like Jude or Frankie de Jong.",Arsenal,Yes,j6xk5bs,t1_j6xj6nw
Rumours they are back together and she refused to cooperate with the prosecution,Arsenal,Yes,j6x12zn,t1_j6x05fz
"Manchester Police investigated Greenwood, and recommended charges to CPS; CPS charged him; he had been set to go to trial on 27 November 2023.

What happened today was that CPS dropped the charges.

And from the slightly snippy tone of the Greater Manchester Police statement, they don't seem especially happy about it, and are quite keen to throw CPS under the bus for this.",Arsenal,Yes,j6x0zy7,t1_j6x05fz
Bold of you to assume any sporting organization has morals.  Marcus Alonso killed someone and had a very successful career afterwards.,Arsenal,Yes,j6x079z,t1_j6wza7u

"There are two so far as I know. Another was thrown out. 

And they all know each other and had sexual relations with Partey by the way.

Disgusting innit,Arsenal,Yes,j6wpar8,t1_j6wp3ts
I think they'll struggle as long as there are incompetent people in charge. Potter himself was good and Brighton is well run. This is crucial,Arsenal,Yes,j6wqa30,t1_j6wpj66
"English club sure. 

He‚Äôll play in Europe though. Maybe not at a mega club but there are definitely clubs who will play him. 

Failing that the Middle East or Asia for sure he‚Äôd play.",Arsenal,Yes,j6yrepu,t1_j6ymzue
And the justice system having a bar so high for rape even with recording on the matter. It's a combination of various things which makes the official ruling pointless.,Arsenal,Yes,j6x4iqn,t1_j6x3cic
Yeah man I feel like he was playing kinda deeper for us than he would do now as an 8? If the numbers made sense I'd have him back on a free for sure would be a great player to have in the squad. Just ain't sure we could get the numbers to suit us tho,Arsenal,Yes,j70efpf,t1_j703gao
Why not mate?,Arsenal,Yes,j70ex6k,t1_j701k3s
Why‚Äôs Reims tactical set up stupid?,Arsenal,Yes,j6w746r,t1_j6w6qtw
"Decision making isn't just computed for if you shoot or pass in front of the goal, and even then Odegaard hasn't let his passing instead of shooting habit surface this year.

Decision making is a strenuous process that is evaluated everytime a player has ball at his feet. Every pass they pick, the tempo they play at, it's all decision making. And nobody in our team has decision making as good as him (since Ozil in fact).

If there was an A+, he'd be A+. 

It's pretty much his strongest suit. He wouldn't be half the conductor he is, without spatial understanding followed up by elite decision making.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wdmq7,t1_j6w7z4o
How can you possibly tell it's Partey lol,Arsenal,Yes,j6xczdu,t1_j6xc44k
A little ironic coming from arsenal fans no?,Arsenal,Yes,j70aa6f,t1_j707r8f
"I'd like to say that but there are enough chairmen willing to take the risk to get a player who should be beyond their reach.

"You‚Äôd hope so but..he‚Äôs a 21 year old player who was valued at over 50m before this. Remember, he has 0 criminal charges right now

I hate it but someone will seriously risk their reputation",Arsenal,Yes,j705o14,t1_j7040xt
"Oh, he'll play. My suspicion is he goes out to a foreign league, balls out for a while, then comes back to a UEL-level side to test the waters, then goes back to a top team.

Lack of nuance from OP is jarring,Arsenal,Yes,j6x80m5,t1_j6x69yb
"What makes me laugh is that grown ass adults do not know how easy it is to fabricate text messages these days and that with the right app even a 13-year-old can do it in five seconds.

Wait. What ?!?!",Arsenal,Yes,j6zonn4,t1_j6zo8yk
It's a hyperbole but the amount of people saying we need to sign a top cf becaude Eddie might get injured would mean we had 3 for one spot when all fit.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w5d2a,t1_j6w56bw
Eddie played wide for development not because he‚Äôs actually any good there.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w64yb,t1_j6w5ig8

We want you to perform well in UCL. It‚Äôs not always about winning. It‚Äôs about playing with a style and competing. Arsenal is the only club I respect in pl because they always chose a manager who would play with a style rather than just winning (read Chelsea).,Arsenal,Yes,j6wo3dk,t1_j6wnx4h
Why bro?,Arsenal,Yes,j6wnlo7,t1_j6wniue
No way? Right ?,Arsenal,Yes,j6xw3mf,t1_j6xvp48

I have. The transfer record outside of the top 6 + Newcastle is like 50m.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w4syx,t1_j6w4l50
"The most likely source of someone spending big money for Balogun would be what happens every summer.

A team has a player that wants to leave, then spends a similar amount on a replacement.

It's how Napoli went from Cavani to searching, then Higauin to Osimhen.

It's how Atletico has swapped strikers like 7x in 15 years.

A team gets in 50-80m, then the teams bargaining with them know that's what they have to spend. It just happened to us in a similar fashion.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w52lm,t1_j6w4l50
"He would only have 1 year on his contract after that supposed Palace loan, no chance the club loans him out in that scenario, and getting him to sign an extension would be close to impossible if you loan him out again after the outrageous season he's currently having. He's better than a loan right now",Arsenal,Yes,j6w50xs,t1_j6w4nhi
"If he chooses the US, could actually see PSG going for it for the marketing.

Don't forget they have Jordan branded kits rather than just plain Nike.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w53vv,t1_j6w4nhi
Jesus is #1 in Arteta's eyes he is going nowhere. He is also important for the mentality and culture around the dressing room,Arsenal,Yes,j6w5c63,t1_j6w51ps
"Amazing how we've gone from 'we're fucked without Jesus' to this in the space of about a month and a half.

Balogun is looking good, he's nowhere near the finished article to be deciding to bin our most transformational player of the season.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w5p6h,t1_j6w51ps
"Tapsoba also LCB, but could be RCB here, as he‚Äôs right-footed. 

Never had a RCB target with Saliba in the fold.",Arsenal,Yes,j6y7vou,t1_j6y7eoo
"Yes because she was basically pressured by her dad and Greenwood who basically broke the law and got in touch with her. Even if this case is different, the statistic still show it is a huge problem in general when it comes to rape charges. For example Sweden had a new law implemented that made a gigantic jump in the way sexual charges are seen. It should 100% be seen as an issue",Arsenal,Yes,j6xj6ph,t1_j6xi4zx

yup that's what I read into those texts.  silver lining part was where she said no and he left her alone to sleep and he went somewhere else.,Arsenal,Yes,j6z985h,t1_j6z8q4r
Yeah lol @ that united guy trying to compare the two. there is alot of doubt and uncertainly around Thomas's case but with Greenwood it was all out there.,Arsenal,Yes,j6zwuu3,t1_j6zw9xu

Club didn‚Äôt do it but rices family did.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wys0k,t1_j6wvnxy
All the major news outlets simultaneously reported that Rice was our target 2 weeks ago. That was almost certainly a deliberate leak by the club.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wwav3,t1_j6wvnxy

">  Saka was a class A academy player 

Not at all. Saka was so highly rated that he was given his debut at 17. Unless you are talking of the time when he was under 15, then I have no idea.",Arsenal,Yes,j6weprs,t1_j6wdujl
"In ultra-running the last-man standing format  to win you must complete one more lap than the 2nd to last person. If the last two fail to complete at the same lap then both are out and it‚Äôs considered to have no winners.

"I don't think Rice will go for ¬£80ish millions. No chance. Not if one of Man City, Liverpool, Chelsea or Man Utd are in for him. He is a prem proven, young, versatile and a regular england national team starter.

I've been an arsenal fan for a little over twenty years, winning league titles and being a regular in the UCL and I've never seen us be comfortably able to cover the expenses of someone our rivals want too. I'd love to see us going all in on him, but I'm afraid that's not how we operate. Tielemans or Zubimendi might be more realistic options since Barca is broke.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wf5nc,t1_j6wcibs
"If one of them is willing to ride the bench then I'd love a competetive situation like that. We don't need to pick now, I'm just stating what I currently think about it. We've got 7 months to make a decision. I'm just having a feeling we need to sell players for a total of ¬£50-¬£70m to afford Rice. We can keep all the strikers if we go for Zubimendi instead.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wfk2y,t1_j6wcsjf
"He does seem like one who puts his football first. I'm not certain if he feels that way if Man City miss out on Jude, send an ¬£100m offer to West Ham and a four year and ¬£380k/week offer to Declan to play for Pep. I'd take it if I was Declan/West ham to be honest if we go ¬£85m and ¬£220k/week. Our board has already stated we don't go for bidding wars.

I'm already prepared for Zubimendi. I rate him quite highly and he fits better to our transfer strategy too.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wg4c1,t1_j6wcuyf
"Jude will be hotter, but yeah, we're going to have to go all out for Rice.",Arsenal,Yes,j6wekcb,t1_j6wcuyf

"also people forget jesus and eddie sub each other often to maintain stamina, also since we have no saka backup before trossard we can now rotate martinelli saka trossard jesus on the wing comfortably instead of pushing injured saka to keep playing",Arsenal,Yes,j6wgvl3,t1_j6wel41

"100%, when things aren‚Äôt going right easy to think this one change can save you.

You‚Äôre probably right that fatigue played a large part in that performance. But I also think the way Leeds set up against us was quite impressive and we would have struggled in any case. The problem is that it requires serious levels of intensity which most teams cannot produce consistently.,Arsenal,Yes,j6y71nn,t1_j6y6foa
i agree. leeds were relentless with the press. they played very well.,Arsenal,Yes,j6yvjg2,t1_j6y6oh9
I think Jesus just wants to play. I don‚Äôt think he cares all that much about whether he‚Äôs on the wing or a striker. He seems to have the mentality of ‚ÄúI just want to help the team‚Äù.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wduvp,t1_j6wavd0

">  I think they are frustrated mainly because of our success this season so far and it‚Äôs boiled over.

I think that's definitely a major part and I've seen a few admit it but we really can only take credit for removing the best argument that ENIC had left which was that they were doing better than us.

Now their fans are feeling an end of an era coming on and the beginning of a new one for Arsenal they're looking back at this period of 'success' and seeing that they ahve absolutely fuck all to show for it",Arsenal,Yes,j6zudm1,t1_j6zts8w

"I mean Lloris has a European and World Cup winners medal, he's maybe never been truly world class but until recently he's definitely been at the top of whatever level comes underneath that.

Son, Kane, Bale, Lloris, Modric and in the Bale sale they had their Anelka/Coutinho moment where the cash was there to do something incredible and they absolutely fucked it.

I've only seen Richarlison play up front for Brazil and he's just not going to get that kind of service at Spurs, it's a scary thought just what Kane might be able to do in a team that's actually creative...",Arsenal,Yes,j6zv2ft,t1_j6zt5ti
They were dreadful for all of 2019 with Pochettino. He seemed defeated and was giving disheartening press conferences suggesting he‚Äôd walk from spurs at any time. I think they were right to sack him.,Arsenal,Yes,j6ztko4,t1_j6zrcmi
Agreed. One bad season and they pulled the plug. Disgraceful. Almost as bad but not quite as bad was firing quite possibly the greatest cup competition manager ever right before a final.,Arsenal,Yes,j6zrezd,t1_j6zrcmi

The evidence against him is just as damming (not as damming as Greenwood I will admit).

"> I took the point to be that here we have a clear example of a case where a horrible act will not be punished with a conviction.

To be clear, literally no-one here is questioning that Greenwood did 'a horrible act'.

That said, conviction is not punishment; conviction is the result of the process of trial which *allows* punishment-- to the extent that the criminal system is intended to be punitive, which is debatable.

> There are many such cases, especially with domestic violence and sexual assault.

Yes, that is also true; the conviction rates in those cases are shockingly low.

But, in this case, with Greenwood, *why* is that not happening?

Victim agency.

"I don't think it's a matter of him not being good enough, it's a case of continuing his progression and making sure he gets consistent minutes to aid his development.

Agree to disagree then. I much prefer Jesus on the wing to Eddie but I still think he's above Balogun in that role.,Arsenal,Yes,j6wq9l4,t1_j6wn77k

">Are you sure Balo is ready to play PL or CL? 

Not at all I'll let Arteta make that decision when he assesses him during preseason, but if he is then he must remain in the squad. If he isn't then by all means loan him out.

There is more evidence for people to deem Greenwood guilty than the other way round.,Arsenal,Yes,j6y47p1,t1_j6xwb3e

And no that isn‚Äôt material evidence. Text messages stripped of context if they are even real aren‚Äôt material evidence. 

You would need to know the entire context and circumstances in whcih that was said and again I‚Äôll repeat this is someone he had a relationship with.

"My ‚Äòexpert opinion‚Äô is that not guilty does not mean innocent. My human opinion is that I don‚Äôt give a shit what 12 jurors or some twats in the CPS say. I have eyes and ears and (thanks to my parents and whatever divine being is out there) a good head on my shoulders. I saw and listened and concluded that MG and TP are disgusting rapists. I would say the same if it was a footballer at my club in the exact same situations. 

Really and truly, there is a very small minority of alleged rapists that get sent down and that isn‚Äôt because they didn‚Äôt rape their alleged victims, but because it is an extremely difficult thing to prosecute and the police force is a bag of shite. But that does not mean that they are ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù. This is when we, as humans, have to look at a scenario and the facts available to us and make our own judgments. 

There is also the idea of Occam‚Äôs Razor - the idea that requires the fewest assumptions is the correct one. None of this deepfake, photoshop nonsense - if a guy is accused by three women on two different continents of rape and one of those charges was only dropped due to legislation, he is likely a rapist. If another guy is on tape raping his girlfriend or his girlfriend has multiple images of her bruised and bleeding, he is likely a rapist that has been beating her.

I don‚Äôt agree that we look ‚Äúdisjointed on the left‚Äù. Zinchenko and Xhaka have been amazing as ever, and Martinelli is simply having a slight dip in form. 

Nketiah‚Äôs touches are not really low for a CF, and he‚Äôs really not just a poacher anymore. This is exactly my point. Just because he isn‚Äôt Jesus doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs simply a poacher or isn‚Äôt a good fit for our system. He fits our system very well actually, because he is a serious goal threat and has elite movement, so will score a ton of goals in our highly creative system, and create space for our wingers to score. Plus he is able to drop deep and link up play to a very high standard. The stats back this up. He doesn‚Äôt just stay close to goal. That is not what happens if you watch our games, nor is that what is shown by the stats. That is exactly why we have generated *more* xG per game since he‚Äôs been starting.

I don't care whether I like someone or not. If he actually did it, let him rot in jail. That's actual justice.

While both still have good football ahead of them, they‚Äôre on the back end of their careers. They are blocking the youth from playing and developing today, and will be a strain on the balance sheet tomorrow. 

Keppa is owed ¬£7.8m/year for 2 seasons, and while Mendy is only making ¬£6m total over those two years, the club still needs to buy and pay another top keeper. 

You have high earners - (1 year) Auba, Azpilicueta, Baba Rahman, Hudson-Odoi, Kovacic, Loftus-Cheek, Pulisic, (2 years) Ziyech, Sarr - who‚Äôs futures need to be sorted.

If they fail to secure top 4, they‚Äôre set to lose significant revenue, while accruing the cumulative amortization expense for recent transfers (likely including deals that predate Boehly).

Amortisation has nothing to do with payment structure of deal, it's just how the value of players is registered in accounting.

1) The transfer fee is spread through the length of the contract so an 80m signing on an 8 year contract will count as 10m per year towards expenditure. FFP is on a three year rolling average I believe, so you'd only see this signing contributing 30m maximum towards FFP cap (for an extended period of course).

2) Player sale profits are registered the year they were sold. If we sell an academy player for 30 mill, that goes a long way in increasing FFP in the next few years. As shown, it would create the leeway for an 80m signing on an 8 year contract. 

The disclaimer being that you'd have to make another 30m profit from player sales up to four years later and a smaller amount after that and so on. UEFA are also closing the 8 year contract loophole for the summer, player sale profits still prove valuable though as 5 year contracts stretch beyond 3 year rolling average.

3) Selling a player midway through amortisation brings forward the rest of the transfer fee to that year [in the accounts]. If unnamed club sells unnamed 80m player, midway through their 8 year contract, then 40m will be deducted from the player profits. This could even turn the sale into a net loss on their accounts that year. 

If a club wants to boost their FFP cap, they'd want to sell academy players, players they signed for free or cheaply, or valuable players nearing the end of their contract.

4) What does this mean for our unnamed club, *cough* Chelsea? On one side, as long as they keep getting tasty profits on their academy players every 2-3 years, they can maintain a high FFP cap. Sales of players approaching end of contract are also a nice boon. 

However, there's still a lot of risk with how they've conducted themselves. They've bought 15 players in the year 2022/2023. A good chunk of them on high fees and long contracts. For their most expensive signings, they have to put a lot of faith in these players because selling them early in their contract could very easily cause a net loss in their accounts. The 8 year contracts worsens this.

The next couple years are crucial for them. If they don't bounce back, in terms of results, I can see a situation where clubs no longer want their deadwood - a bloated squad with high wages + amortized fees will limit them in the market severely. If their marquee signings flop and force an early move, or if their academy conveyor belt stops paying dividends, they could find themselves in shit. As I've shown, these things have a more pronounced effect on FFP.

P.s. I'm not an accountant and have done limited reading so I may have got some details wrong.

A last final FFP fact: the buyout clauses set on every Spanish+Portuguese contract cannot be amortised (whole fee registered in that years accounts) and also incur extra taxes. This is because the club is technically paying the lump sum to the player (incurring income tax) to buyout his own contract, who is then signed on a free afterwards. We bought Partey this way; Enzo's deal was negotiated to avoid this; Zubimendi has 55mill buyout this summer. Well done if you read this far.",Arsenal,No,j6ri0rj,t3_10qnzmb

"Come to think of it, it does take a sensible head to separate all the optics of this transfer (which are horrible at first glance) from the actual player, who he is and how he fits. 

- Chelsea player
- Old(er)
- Slow
- Us seemingly helping them with FFP
- Missing out on targets previously this window which Chelsea got instead
- Them potentially getting Caicedo and us getting Jorginho if Enzo deal collapsed
- Missing out on a midfield target in consecutive windows


All of the above is quite maddening if you only focus on that. 

But if you look deeper these don't really matter.

- Point 1 - Doesn't matter
- Point 2 - Short contract so doesn't matter.
- Point 3 - Yes but we are a compact team and he has faster players around him.
- Point 4 - Irrelevant for our title charge.
- Point 5 - This stings and maybe some questions could be asked but doesn't have much to do with Jorginho if we couldn't sign those players.
- Point 6 - Again, out of our control, if Brighton only sell Caicedo for a crazy 100 million fee then we are not paying that.
- Point 7 - Yes but we are still top and have got a replacement for El-Neny in.


Then there are the positives of how Jorginho is liked by Arteta and his experience and winning mentality for the squad. How he is an upgrade on El-Neny and Lokonga. I commented that El-Neny is better defensively than Jorginho but upon reflection that's not entirely true, El-Neny is better maybe at aerial duels and running back and tracking but Jorginho is much better in forward defensive actions so there's some tradeoff, on the ball they are completely different levels.

"Looking at our squad now there aren't any complete weaknesses/missing cover. Think we still have some needs at CB, RW, and LCM (or general youth in the midfield). We'll likely look to re-enforce those spots in the summer, but short term we have players that can play in all of those spots. 

At CB Kiwior is just an unknown and Holding has his limitations. But we have White and Tomi who can slide in as needed.

RW there is no out and out backup but Trossard, Jesus, Vieira, and ESR can/have all played there. There are plenty of options. Feel like we'll end up with a very Pep/City like 3 for 2 spots with all of Trossard, Saka, and Martinelli playing equal-ish minutes. 

It's similar at LCM. There isn't really a like for like replacement for Xhaka. But we can play 2 attacking 8s with ESR or Vieira there. Or maybe even see some 4231 with Jorginho and Partey if there is a longer term issue. I'm actually really excited to see ESR in likely more midfield roles. 

Overall, while we didn't get our top 2 targets, I feel like we really set ourselves up for a solid run to end the season in the window.

For starters, we need to stop seeing Jorginho and Xhaka as the potential midfield setup. You're still thinking in the Wenger/Emery/early Arteta double pivot setups, which isn't the plan anymore. For all intents and purposes, Jorginho's midfield partners will be Zinchenko and White. He won't be playing in a pivot, but more a fluid pivot-trivote that shifts around in buildup depending on White's positioning, with Xhaka and Odegaard positioning themselves more as pseudo-forwards.

This actually suits Jorginho - at Chelsea, some of his best form came when he wasn't exposed as the lone pivot, but instead put into a double pivot in a 3-4-2-1. They build up with a similar 5-5 block to us, where the wingbacks play a similar role to our wingers by staying high and wide to pull open defensive shapes, and alternate between each other to provide goalscoring options on the far side. While their shape is more a 3-2 in buildup rather than 2-3, ours can shift between both depending on where White moves. 

Our system - as well as that 3-4-3/3-4-2-1 popularized in the EPL by Conte - also heavily focuses upon guarding against counterattacks by ensuring there's always a solid defensive block of 5. So when people worry about 'how will Jorginho defend', they're not considering how the new system is meant to work. Alone, he won't be good enough. But he's not defending alone, he's defending with 4 others to restrict space into dangerous zones for onrushing attackers. This is where his ability to intercept, and then move the ball forward calmly is so so good, more than you believe. He doesn't need to win a leg race and then do a proper English tackle, Terry Butcher-style. The team just needs to shepherd attackers into dead ends, pick the ball off them, then efficiently recycle the ball to continue killing the opposition with a thousand cuts.

Jorginho is more than good enough for that setup.",Arsenal,No,j6rl6t7,t3_10qnzmb

"A point of comparison I've not seem put up yet is last January, which is perhaps surprisingly revealing.

A year ago, we went in hard for Vlahovic, missed, and signed no-one instead. This window, we went for Mudryk, missed-- and signed Trossard to add depth to our attack. Ultimately, even if you were happy with Eddie's performance -- and he's only gone from strength to strength since -- and remain skeptical about Trsosard or disappointed about missing on Mudryk (and/or Raphinha), surely that's a better result from the window.

As reported by Ornstein after the fact, we also made a move for Schlotterbeck a year ago, and again missed. A week ago, we signed Kiwior from Spezia. Gabriel now has a direct backup.

Ornstein also reported that we made a move for Arthur-- and that, contrary to bizarrely popular belief, this deal did not break down over Juve's loan terms: to which both Edu and Arteta agreed, and with which they wanted to proceed. Instead, as reported, it broke down when Edu presented their deal to the club 'hierarcy' (Ornstein's word) who refused it. In short, Edu and Arteta wanted Arthur on an 18 month loan with a ‚Ç¨40m option.

This time around, we got Jorginho on an 18 month contract (+1 option) for ¬£10+2m.

While there have been some truly insane overratings of Jorginho on here -- my favourite being the Chelsea superfan who insisted Jorginho would not backup but immediately replace Thomas -- surely the sheer horror expressed over the prospect of Arthur should warm the less credulous a little to Jorginho.

My own view is that we should give Arteta whoever he wants, and Edu whatever he needs to do that; I can even see why they wanted Arthur as an 8, though the need for Jorginho's cover as a 6 is a lot more intense.",Arsenal,No,j6rqlm6,t3_10qnzmb
Still surprised at some of the comments on the Jorginho signing.  It‚Äôs a short term january signing to add experienced depth at a key position.  Didn‚Äôt break the bank and allows us to stay on course for our summer transfer plans,Arsenal,No,j6rsrld,t3_10qnzmb

"Even as someone who has repeatedly called Jorginho overrated (was scandalised by his inclusion in the Ballon D'Or top three) and generally dislikes him as a player, I'd have to admit there's a lot of things to like about this deal:

1. Lack of adjustment time: Can't think of a player (other than Busquets) with more coaching as a number 6 in a posession-oriented team, both in terms of passing and defensive awarenesss. Should in theory mean he can slot into our team (either replacing an injured Partey or in our second XI) without needing much time to gel.

2. Weaknesses mitigated: His most significant weakness (though he has others) is a difficulty depending large spaces, due to his poor athleticism and lack of agility. However, thanks to our highly compact system and the physically dominant players around him, we should be okay. For example, even though Partey is extremely athletic (remember him playing RB against us for Atletico), he seldom has to use his burst of pace - that run to track Anthony last week was an exception, rather than the norm. My only concern in this respect is that Jorginho will be less protected if he gets minutes in our second XI (e.g., with ESR and Vieira in midfield rather than Xhaka and Ode), but I'm sure Arteta will pick a team keeping this in mind. 

3. Not injury prone/added recovery time: Despite playing a high volume of games for Chelsea in recent years, he's managed to stay clear of injury. In fact, one of the biggest criticisms has been that he's lost his legs a bit, which hopefully should be less of a problem if he's a backup player rather than a starter. We saw this a bit with Ronaldo last season: he's obviously not close to the physical specimen he was, but could still look somewhere close to his old self when he'd had a week or more off between games. 

4. Complements our team well from a temperament standpoint: Our team, as a whole, tends to be too aggressive at times when we're in the lead - trying to push too hard to manufacture another goal, often ceding possession and then territory as a result. It's weird, because most teams fall into the trap of being too direct when they're chasing a win, rather than maintaining one - we're actually incredibly patient in the former context. Jorginho should be a good foil for this. I can see Arteta bringing him on for Xhaka/Partey when we're leading, and instructing him to just retain the ball as much as possible with safe passes. 'Kill the game with 3000 passes' and all that. 

5. Doesn't clog up resources: Going for a higher-ceiling but more expensive option (say, Bamba or Edson Alvarez) would run the risk of being a waste of money, and possibly preventing us from buying a genuinely world-class player in that position. Bit similar to going for Trossard over a 50-60 million player when we lost Mudryk - the option of a long-term top-drawer DM (or in Trossard's case, winger) stays alive, and we don't have to rush into a subobtimal January move. Particularly true since Jorginho's contract is so short-term. 

6. Experience, leadership etc: Our players have spoken about how important the mental boost provided by Jesus and Zinchenko was. I have no idea if Jorginho will have a similar effect, but he should in theory, given that he's played in  and won high-pressure tournaments before. Could be important in the run in. 

7. European suitability: Given that a lot of his games as a starter (provided Partey remains fit) will come in Europe, his lack of athleticism and physicality should also not be exposed quite as much as it sometimes is in the Prem. That's also the stage he's shone most historically - UCL, Europa, Euros (similarly low intensity). 

There's obviously downsides - one being that he can only really deputise for Partey (unlike Caicedo, who could fill in as a 6 or an 8) - but a 1.5 year deal at 10-12 million could very well prove to be smart business. Like I said, I've had a longstanding dislike for Jorginho (that 2-1 loss at the Emirates when he scored the equaliser after avoiding being sent off still annoys me), but I reckon this makes sense if our number one targets weren't achievable.",Arsenal,No,j6rnk6i,t3_10qnzmb

Even when we didn't get Mudryk or Caicedo we could've gone for Diaby and Bamba but that would've been a panic move instead we got players with experience and considerably less price.

like the first galactico era of real madrid was broadly a failure with only some initial success because of a lack of competition ‚Äì it was a world very shy of 8 figure transfer fees. the more expensive stars they recruited into their team the less success they yielded until you end up in 2006 with henry embarrassing the entire madrid midfield and defence and they retool their approach to squadbuilding

and chelsea just did a mix of nottingham forest shopping spree with a youth galactico strategy (not even a genuine galactico strategy) and there's every chance it doesn't amount to much despite the expectation. because at the end of the day, it's them just chasing hype and trying to speedrun a rebuild without consideration for locker room dynamics and other human factors that make teams mesh or not, that draws good performances out of players, or not. like it smacks of like.. a fifa rebuild challenge. youtube ass team

By expected points, they are behind West Ham and .3 of a point above Aston Villa. That's their level of performances this season.

I know Felix is fun in FIFA. Mudryk and Enzo might get to the top, but this year? Potter doesn't know his best XI and this won't happen overnight. 

If we could use any Chelsea players for our match vs City, people here would probably take James to start. And that's it!

"Think some here are severely understating that it's not only the defensive prowess that Partey possesses that is lost without him, but moreso his technical and physical ability. Jorginho has never had the ability to turn on a dime under pressure and drive forward 20 yards to open up space like Partey can. Just this alone could affect how our fullbacks and advanced 8s operate during transition sequences. It could create undue pressure on these exterior units that have worked so well in the system (LB-LCM-LW and opp.) in not only how/where they defend but carrying play forward. 

You can say that the way we play will keep him on the ball more often than not, and if the play is in front of him everything should run smoothly, but that possessional security is predicated only on the most optimal scenarios. We don't just dominate games 100% over the full 90 minutes. Instances of being put under pressure don't just happen once per opponent, multiple have and will happen over the course of a match. A ball will inevitably be flying over his head and at some point his role and ability defensively as the lone 6 would be put to the test. 

Things would have to adjust in some ways ***if*** he is required to play the bulk of a PL 90' there, it's not just a plug and play, set and forget. Any top half team worth their salt would be looking to readjust their aggression and tenacity regarding midfield battles if they knew before the team sheets were announced it would be Jorginho instead of Partey there. 

We'll be fine, it's just the immediate concern that floods the mind. Regardless, the top objective concerning Jorg should be helping get the EL squad closer to something resembling the first team, which I believe he can do. But the early March EL fixture will also likely be the first instance of a Xhaka+Jorginho(+Vieira) midfield that would showcase what 2/3 of our worst case, Partey-less midfield could look like.",Arsenal,No,j6rkrzt,t3_10qnzmb

"Has Potter ever developed or worked with top level attacking talent?

The three big moves from Brighton have been White, Cucurella, and Bissouma.  Only one of those has really been outstanding in a new club so far.

Not to drag Potter, but it is kind of weird that a central aspect of Chelsea's current strategy appears to be that Potter will take and develop a collection of younger players into world beaters.  Arsenal took a similar bet, but Arteta at least had Sane and Sterling singing his praises - there was more reason to believe he would be the right guy for Martinelli and Saka.

January 2023 we spend our time chasing Mudryk and only decide we should get a midfielder once that doesn't work out and Elneny's injury is determined to be season ending. Chasing a player who wasn't going to be sold only to end up with a bit of a panic stop gap.

Many are influenced by what chelsea are doing. It makes no sense because our way of doing things has been working fine and this is a january window where no one really spends too much,Arsenal,Yes,j6r86mh,t1_j6r7og0
"I've got one.

We spent too long on Caicedo despite being told it wasn't going anywhere and were left to scrounge around a bit on deadline day",Arsenal,Yes,j6r7yg2,t1_j6r7og0
"Dont care about any relationships.

Those mugs will be giving us the guard of honor when we play them next.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r8wnu,t1_j6r7gml
"Fuck Brighton, if they truly are that upset about a second bid then they can fuck off. We'll go for zubimendi instead in the summer",Arsenal,Yes,j6r809b,t1_j6r7gml
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. The different look between the 2 is also a nightmare for defenders.,Arsenal,Yes,j6s4b0y,t1_j6s3ofd
"He‚Äôs definitely fighting with Eddie for 2nd choice striker. Not a knock on Eddie, but that‚Äôs how he will approach the preseason, and Arteta will award him if he earns it. I do expect a loan to a team in the Premiership next year.",Arsenal,Yes,j6th8h4,t1_j6tgfnx
Think loaning him to Everton next season ala Lakaka is a good move if Teta thinks hes still needs experience.,Arsenal,Yes,j6uthcp,t1_j6upwsa
Why would he want to go on another loan lol,Arsenal,Yes,j6uq4an,t1_j6upwsa
Is anyone saying 30M is a good price?,Arsenal,Yes,j6vwtz3,t1_j6vwpmj
"The contract length tells us that the club sees him as a title-winning depth signing and nothing more. He will be 32 by June 2024. I feel icky about giving Chelsea money but eh. We do what we must.

This summer there‚Äôs no excuse for missing out on a marquee midfielder though, whether it‚Äôs Rice or Caicedo.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rahfc,t1_j6r9o7a
"City would do well to win 5 games in a row at the moment. They are a clear level below what they have been for the past 4-5 years. If it wasn't for some really dodgy decisions, they would be further behind.

Love how the media have brushed off the fact that we (who apparently have no depth) made 6 changes against them away in the cup whilst they only changed their GK and we arguably were the better side. The first half especially, City couldn't cope with our six man press in their final third. Really only Liverpool have done that to City under Pep.

If City don't improve and fast, we could genuinely rip them apart with our first team at the Emirates this month.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rrjtx,t1_j6rrb9x
"Agreed. Watching us is like watching those city and Liverpool sides at their peak.
For many people they are the two best sides any one has seen in English football and we look as good as them.
It‚Äôs an incredible turnaround",Arsenal,Yes,j6ru7gr,t1_j6rrb9x
"this one not necessarily, but that process doesn't bode well long term. it's annoying this scatter brain approach has got them mudryk and enzo",Arsenal,Yes,j6t9muu,t1_j6t7z1f
"If you are new to football and have willingly decided to support Chelsea, you'd have to be a shameless weirdo.",Arsenal,Yes,j6u4ksd,t1_j6u3olx
"Pretty much sums up Chelsea. They're not even so much happy about the signings as they are about how much people dislike them for it. 

Just a weird weird club.",Arsenal,Yes,j6u78n5,t1_j6u3olx
"It's the types of people who were attracted to them in the first place.

That's just the kind of club they are. They attract that FIFA kiddie type who only wants shiny new things.

I would be amazed if most of them even watched their games.",Arsenal,Yes,j6u6c4h,t1_j6u3olx
"What else should they be happy about, being in 10th and playing like shit?",Arsenal,Yes,j6u4oe0,t1_j6u3olx
I‚Äôve never prayed for a player to flop more,Arsenal,Yes,j6r80ku,t1_j6r7huz
"Chelsea currently seem like a very bad place for a young player to really shine but Andrey santos is a very good player. He was by far one of the best players in the 2nd tier of brazilian football and was a standout perforner, Vasco Da Gama do produce some very solid talent and are a pretty big club.",Arsenal,Yes,j6s2nsl,t1_j6s1d6h
Told you he was a bargain.,Arsenal,Yes,j6t5umb,t1_j6t5jdq
It certainly was.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tescp,t1_j6ted72
"Rice & Caicedo are still 100% easily doable in the summer too, perhaps a winger too if we deem we need one. It‚Äôs looking good brev",Arsenal,Yes,j6rpk90,t1_j6rpeip
"Makes sense. Apparently he's tried to sign him for Arsenal many times and City wanted him when he was at Napoli and Arteta was assistant manager.

There's also that video of him talking about the 6 position and he mentions Busquets and Jorginho in the same bracket.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rs7tg,t1_j6rs1rm
"They are just the club getting unlucky this year. They are 10 goals below their xG. Antonio, Scamacca and Bowen couldn't score this year if the goals were 10 feet high.

They have the 5th best defense in the PL by expected goals.

Basically this year Fulham have been *incredibly luckY* with their results and West Ham unlucky. A more fair table would flip those teams, but luck is part of the game.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sss2m,t1_j6squpc
"They were heavily reliant on goals from Mr Dani Dyer and he's just stopped scoring, they bought players up front who got injured and Moyes doesn't seem to have been able to make up for it.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ss3sn,t1_j6squpc
"This is the new production of *Henry V* I always wanted.

'Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst, and thou shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better.'",Arsenal,Yes,j6tg0ie,t1_j6tfn7p
"Because what City does is almost impossible to do, and even then it doesn‚Äôt work out that well for them. Sane, Sterling, Jesus, Zinchenko, Cancelo all leaving in recent years. It is going to be literally impossible to keep 3 high level strikers happy when you‚Äôre playing a formation with only one striker.",Arsenal,Yes,j6un29c,t1_j6uliwv
I would hope all the loaned out players look back at Arsenal and desire to come back and play. Want to see everyone working towards a spot. Very possible if we win this damn thing.  Last thing I‚Äôd want to see if a very public display of wanting to leave,Arsenal,Yes,j6vkki2,t1_j6vk6si
We sold Bennacer and we couldve bought him back and played him here tho prolly he chose to play in Milan for gametime.,Arsenal,Yes,j6vl8v8,t1_j6vk6si
He‚Äôs not going to be the new Kane lol,Arsenal,Yes,j6vtyw5,t1_j6vk6si
"ESR's return will be huge for us.

As is Martinelli's extension.",Arsenal,Yes,j6s2kth,t1_j6rxyyd
"The funny thing is, who the club actually recruited are better equipped to help secure this title charge than both ‚Äú1st choice players,‚Äù of which, we‚Äôd likely only be able to recruit/afford one.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ryb2p,t1_j6rxyyd
"We look stronger while City look weaker since they lost Cancelo. Liverpool and Man U arguably had worse windows than us. Chelsea might be a threat next year but not this season. 2nd half of the season looks promising. Bummed we didn't get mudryk but trossard looks ready to contribute straight away so he could be an important player for us.  


Jorginho might not have been first choice but he was at the very least midtable starter quality this year (lol), he is a proven winner who is used to the league, and I think he might fit our system better anyway since he is a very good on the ball player. For a january backup player I think its a good signing considering the fee and contract length, I'd much rather have him than no one or the elneny/sambi options we had before january.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rzxbq,t1_j6rxyyd
"We did get a ridiculous bargain on √òdegaard, and Chelsea arguably overpaid for what Enzo is now, but he is a very talented and quite different player.",Arsenal,Yes,j6scgx4,t1_j6s6gbs
Enzo won't become a flop. But for sure that's a massive overpay that positive return on player sales is highly unlikely.,Arsenal,Yes,j6s7rma,t1_j6s6gbs
"Thanks for posting this, wonderful read. I'm backing off the ledge.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sgfn3,t1_j6sennu
"that is hilarious, I didn't realise he's 6'7 either lmao

the first goal when he stops the ball on the goal line and nearly loses it to the defender loool",Arsenal,Yes,j6sgtpz,t1_j6sf9rg
Who is that?,Arsenal,Yes,j6sgh5q,t1_j6sf9rg
You know this fella is scoring at least once against us,Arsenal,Yes,j6sg7by,t1_j6sf9rg
Does it? It‚Äôs just a collection of hyped names and nothing coherent.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r56z6,t1_j6r4uu4
Does it? Seems a bit of a mess still,Arsenal,Yes,j6r51za,t1_j6r4uu4
"They have 15 new players and a new manager and backroom staff.

Can't imagine how they can possibly gel and get the managers ideas ono the pitch, will be relying on individual brilliance for results for a long time.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r5ecv,t1_j6r4uu4
"It's sometimes unbearable when we do it for Spurs but what Chelsea is doing is unprecedented. It hasn't been seen before since Chelsea did it in 2003-6. It's worth discussion, if it isn't 'throwing your toys' discussion. 

That said, being insecure about a club you're 21 points ahead of is weird. They got a few flashy toys, spent ‚Ç¨600M, but seriously, you have something good going. This could have been a lot worse. Imagine it's 2020, we are 8th as it was and Chelsea is up by 21 points.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sk84r,t1_j6s5y2f
"Yeah, but Lokonga barely played outside of EL and cups. I think we will be fine without him.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4657,t1_j6r3vam
"Our chances against the top teams drastically go down without Thomas but I now feel like we can batter smaller teams without him. 

Mo was always too safe in possession against teams that sat off (hence the weird moments where he'd have the ball for what felt like an eternity) but Jorginho can pass through the lines consistently so we should be good on that front. On the other hand, Elneny is good in big games because he has 6 lungs and can cover ground quite well, but Jorginho can't do that so we will be very reliant on our structure holding together to hide him.

Thomas's biggest superpower is the combination of elite progression and physical tools to always be in the right spot. Elneny provided the latter and Jorgi will now provide the former. There should only be a few games were we need a dominant, ""complete"" performance from Thomas and more games where the passing aspect is crucial, so covering that attribute makes perfect sense.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4fd7,t1_j6r3vam
"This is what I was saying. Don‚Äôt get letting Sambi go for now. Even if you just sub him on late on in games we‚Äôve got wrapped up, it helps reduce the minutes of the key midfielders. I like the Palace loan but we should have waited",Arsenal,Yes,j6r3z1j,t1_j6r3vam
"‚ÄúSeason over if Partey gets injured‚Äù.

Alright, calm down",Arsenal,Yes,j6r608p,t1_j6r3vam
"5 years is still a bit too much if we're being honest.

If Chelsea had offered some of those guys they've got on 7 year deals, 5 year ones it doesn't make too much of a difference really.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4im1,t1_j6r46y3
They have assigned seats with names engraved on the chairs since they know they‚Äôll be there for a long while,Arsenal,Yes,j6ruzyb,t1_j6ruhe2
I think the rule is to not loan out to foreign clubs.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rzdv4,t1_j6rz4g9
"I'm in a mood to shit on Chelsea, but kind of wild how they really fucked over two players like that because of the Enzo deal.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t2z3t,t1_j6t1gid
My condolences for your loss. I hope he enjoyed what he did get to see this season.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r8p0r,t1_j6r8hkt
"Condolences, fellow Gunner. Would be a nice gift to him when we win the league!",Arsenal,Yes,j6r8vnx,t1_j6r8hkt
Sorry to hear that man. That‚Äôs super tough. I hope we deliver a title this season for you and your dad. Hope you and your fam take care.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r9gt2,t1_j6r8hkt
"Certainly helps that we did the double over spuds, that kinda cooled the hatred",Arsenal,Yes,j6vlyub,t1_j6vc5za
That's assuming we get penalties called in the first place...,Arsenal,Yes,j6r925w,t1_j6r8c2i
"Agreed much better places to spend the money. 6, 8 and RW.",Arsenal,Yes,j6twc83,t1_j6tvseh
"We need to tie him down first, last I heard Chelsea was sniffing about",Arsenal,Yes,j6u3nab,t1_j6u37ow
"The scary thing is that I can genuinely see Sousa being our inverted LB in the next few years, and he's probably not even in my top 5 upcoming Hale End talent right now. It's actually insane.",Arsenal,Yes,j6uqndo,t1_j6uobgq
Charles Sagoe Jr too?,Arsenal,Yes,j6ureys,t1_j6uobgq
"Think Norton-cuffy would make a good Right Winger in sakas position eventually if not next season. Might be good to try him out there if we cant/dont get a right sided  winger. 

Remember Saka started off as a fullback too",Arsenal,Yes,j6v0ul1,t1_j6uobgq
"We got done exactly what we needed to get it done, with minimal risk to dressing room disruptions which I think is not mentioned enough. Our 1st team is good enough for the title so we brought them support and set us up very well to challenge for the title even if we get injuries to key players. I'm very happy with this and very excited to see who we bring in in the summer now. COYG",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4m7m,t1_j6r415j
"Sambi too, hope him and Marq smash it out there",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4ziu,t1_j6r415j
Antony is Marquinhos with blonde hair and can spin better. 3-4 mil.,Arsenal,No,j6r50ro,t1_j6r4t3o
Probably the first football tournament that Boehly watched end to end.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r4lnd,t1_j6r4f14
"I‚Äôm happy with either tbh. I agree he looked better than white against United but Everton aren‚Äôt a threat and we know white is fully capable, was just having an off day.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rfzxf,t1_j6rfox9
"A fit Tomiyasu is better than White at RB imo but
Ben White had a poor half against United, don't think Arteta will drop him for 1 bad half",Arsenal,Yes,j6rhc1k,t1_j6rfox9
"Thinking about this recently too. Even with good results, we've had some absolutely thin benches, a lot of academy kids.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rvfa4,t1_j6ruvff
Imagine by the end of next summer what it could look like,Arsenal,Yes,j6rx858,t1_j6ruvff
"7/10.

Kiwior unproven in the league, Holding proven not to be good enough (although I suppose good enough to be 5th choice CB) and Vieira needs some more meat on his skinny body.

Other than those its pretty good but can obviously be improved further.",Arsenal,Yes,j6s234q,t1_j6rwl3t
6.89,Arsenal,Yes,j6rwyse,t1_j6rwl3t
"I mean if City's bench is a 10, then it's got to be a 6/7. But I think it's good enough to help finish the job",Arsenal,Yes,j6rxsjq,t1_j6rwl3t
"lacking a striker for now, but when one of Jesus or Eddie is on the bench then it's a really solid bench

ESR/Trossard/Eddie are fantastic offensive options off the bench, as are Tierney and Tomiyasu for defensive options. Jorginho is solid, just need Vieira to be more reliable off the bench",Arsenal,Yes,j6s1hxg,t1_j6rwl3t

Pure evil indeed",Arsenal,Yes,j6tdhxg,t1_j6tcn2v
"He's actually playing well at Lyon because he's the focal point of the attack, unlike here in his last years where he was used to create space and chances for the wingers",Arsenal,Yes,j6uc3vt,t1_j6u746f
"A lot are really close.

Partey has been sensational. It's not a crime to say Rodri or Casemiro has had a better season so far.

Martinelli has been great. Even Trossard has a claim to have had just of strong of a season.

Odegaard has a claim for best player in the entire league this season. But again, if someone said KDB, who has largely been the best player in the league the last ~5 years, they aren't an idiot.

The best part of this team is that while we have great individuals, we aren't reliant on great individual performance. It is a fantastic team and structure. Everyone elevates the level of the rest.",Arsenal,Yes,j6v8qaz,t1_j6v29zf
If he has a decent 6 months maybe we could sell him to Chelsea for 100m,Arsenal,Yes,j6r57lm,t1_j6r4k3i
Stop drinking.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r4pia,t1_j6r4k3i
"He'll score a couple of goals and everyone who doesn't watch Palace will be like WOW WHY DID WE LET HIM GO HE CAN REPLACE XHAKA and as soon as he comes back he'll lose the ball or be out of position, we'll concede and everyone will say ""oh yeah shit""",Arsenal,Yes,j6r53o4,t1_j6r4k3i

"He's probably 7th in the depth sheet of two wing spots. A series of loans awaits that guy. I understand leaving a big team's academy, but to go to Chelsea's? Better off going to Fulham/Palace",Arsenal,Yes,j6sby6p,t1_j6saizl
"They have 8 players on loan, maybe 1 of them has a future at the club.",Arsenal,Yes,j6so3qr,t1_j6snsbk
Hopefully. Could be a great player if he can find it again.,Arsenal,Yes,j6stjlg,t1_j6sssxd

"Unless Fresneda was to be an RCB and lead to the sale of Holding, it was far fetched.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vyymj,t1_j6vy0qu
"Fresneda seems to have been an almost opportunistic transfer, at 18 he's not displacing anyone in the first team just yet, not even Holding.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vzbkn,t1_j6vy0qu
"Also Fresneda is really young. If he was to play for arsenal he'd hardly get a match unless Tomiyasu moves to CB. So it's fine. Dude's 18. He needs to play. We're not chelsea that we get an 18 year old then have 6-7 players ahead of him. 

Omari, if you're seeing this, great decision. Good luck with your 5 loan spells",Arsenal,Yes,j6vzb4p,t1_j6vy0qu
Lol weren't those the same idiots screaming Arteta Out,Arsenal,Yes,j6rfpfc,t1_j6rfdxh
"Thank you. This is what I‚Äôve been saying. It‚Äôs actually crazy how deep rooted and widespread this narrative is. ‚ÄúEdu wanted Royal‚Äù, ‚ÄúEdu can‚Äôt negotiate‚Äù, ‚ÄúEdu is a release clause merchant‚Äù, ‚ÄúEdu is a fraud‚Äù and on and on‚Ä¶ 

People who spend less time F5ing on Reddit and twitter for Arsenal news all seem to think he‚Äôs doing a very good job. I remember Fabrizio saying he thought Edu was ‚Äúone of the best in the game‚Äù and that we needed to give him time, and that was in the summer after we had finished 8th for a second time. He‚Äôs being proven right and people are still calling for Edu‚Äôs head. It would be hilarious if it wasn‚Äôt so annoying.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rfzhl,t1_j6rfdxh

I‚Äôm very confused as to how anyone could have this perspective.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rg55b,t1_j6rfdxh
"I'll once again reiterate that literally any Arsenal fan would have done the job Edu has done here. 

He has never pulled anything out of the ordinary. Arteta wants a player, Edu inquires, he gets quoted a price, he tries to negotiate and spectacularly fails, and finally decides to pay the full price. If no other team is in for the player, we sign them. If another team is in, we don't. The sole exception was Jesus, and that was 100% down to Arteta approaching him first and guaranteeing that he'd be the big man. 

Not one single transfer under Edu has gone differently. 

I won't even get into the sales.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rgso9,t1_j6rfdxh

I know we have ""principles"" but every big name transfer besides Jesus he has gone after he has not been able to get it over the line.  Weeks of drama, back and forth, follow-up bids.  I think he has found us gems but lets not kid ourselves that his ability to get the top top players is not proven yet IMO",Arsenal,Yes,j6rz65r,t1_j6rypkt

However, I am concerned how we fumbled the Mudryk deal. Not even due to the player, he might flop it's a big risk att 100 mil and Trossard is great, but I would've liked our processes to be more efficient.

They are already changing the rules so from the end of the season being able to spread the cost like they have for FFP will be a no no.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r57jc,t1_j6r4xz6
"Chelsea were ahead of the pack. The loophole whatever they exploited will be closed for everyone else.

"Londoner here as well mate. And I can tell you that I despise Chelsea more than I do Spurs. Cannot wait for Jorginho to lift the PL with us this year. All those filthy, scummy cunts will be absolutely seething about it.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sbbra,t1_j6sajz6
I think it's quite telling that their local fanbase isn't particularly big. Most of their fans just jumped on the bandwagon when they were winning. With Arsenal you can say that at least we have an identity. If a club doesn't have an identity then what exactly are the supporters supporting?,Arsenal,Yes,j6sbhnr,t1_j6sajz6

He wants to play in the Major League Soccer World Series.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r9s7j,t1_j6r8ot4
"An even shinier silver lining is to look at the amount of money the club was willing to spend this window, and last window, without CL revenue.  It makes you wonder what the club is willing to do in the summer knowing CL is around the corner.  

It's hard to get too bent out of shape with Edu & Co., we were beat by money.  Chelsea is in a position to spend big because they've had years of CL money and a new owner who has, possibly, made assurances to invest a substantial amount of money in the team.  Arsenal had more restrictions just by virtue of the club's position.  

We came out of the window better than when we entered.  That's a mission accomplished even if the lights aren't as bright as we initially hoped.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rx5bs,t1_j6rqlm6

Still not an amazing team though if you compare to us.  Shit keeper, shit no.8s, worse forwards.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rubom,t1_j6rsgau
he's the one now that mudryk is gone,Arsenal,Yes,j6so3s3,t1_j6snl84
"Actually sort of shameful the way they did him tbh.

On his way Atletico for a 6 month loan only to be told that actually he's having the last 18 months of his contract terminated.

And all to get a new RWB for 45M who won't be able to play under whoever their new managers system is when Conte walks in the summer.",Arsenal,Yes,j6swxh5,t1_j6swa7b
Man signed a six month contract with Atletico just to escape,Arsenal,Yes,j6swhdi,t1_j6swa7b

"He‚Äôs not a defensive powerhouse by any stretch, but he can read the game well and will be surrounded by Zinny, Benny Blanco, Gabriel and Saliba.

"We need to beat them at the Emirates. We haven't beaten them in the league since 2015/6, it's a huge statement win for us, will help massively with morale, and ease the pressure.

Also will give us an extended cushion, maybe allowing for a loss/draw at the Etihad.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rj0zd,t1_j6rhvdk
Two draws wouldn‚Äôt be bad because they‚Äôd gain no ground on us but I‚Äôd love to beat them at the emirates.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rils1,t1_j6rhvdk
Absolutely,Arsenal,Yes,j6rjb47,t1_j6rhvdk
Outstanding window all things considered. Particularly for January. We get exactly what we needed; quality depth in key positions. As a bonus we didn‚Äôt even get too badly ripped off.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rip4b,t1_j6rhy2n
Nah I really like Turner tbh. Fine with him there,Arsenal,Yes,j6rrtug,t1_j6rpm0c
Turner earned some respect against City.  I don't see a need to draw a line in the sand on when he gets time in the EL.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rq2px,t1_j6rpm0c
Turner looked like he would put ramsdale under pressure for his league starts against city tbh.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rrmwo,t1_j6rpm0c
"Turner deserves it. after a shaky debut, he's been largely excellent.

It was hilarious how he shut down Haaland by simply rushing out of his box like a madman and kicking it long every time the Android had a chance to run in behind.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rumz7,t1_j6rpm0c
"If that 90 million goes towards a generational talent like Camavinga or Bellingham, 100%",Arsenal,Yes,j6rsb2j,t1_j6rqhzc
No. He‚Äôs extremely hard to replace and it doesn‚Äôt even look like we could get a project player (caicedo) in his position for the same fee.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rreub,t1_j6rqhzc

Yup,Arsenal,Yes,j6rquvh,t1_j6rqhzc
"If we got Rice and Caicedo or equivalent then it'd be a no brainer given Partey's age.

"no, because we need a year at least so he can show his apprentice most likely Caicedo who we will go in for in the summer the ropes. Preferably 2 years. that is priceless, we can sell him then for 25 mill or so.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rr3ro,t1_j6rqhzc
"Incredible footballer but in a heart beat, yes.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rrllq,t1_j6rqhzc
Obviously yes.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rs34e,t1_j6rqhzc
"This past window, not a chance; we'd have crippled our own title push.

This coming summer? No again, because we're hugely dependent on him, and we'll want to at least maintain our level. No-one we buy is going to be able to walk into his role. (Shoutout to the idiot who thinks Jorginho is going to do that lol)

There is a *tiny* possibility that if we make a major signing at the 6 in summer, that player might bed in fast enough that we could consider selling Thomas a year from now. I doubt it, but it's not impossible.

That would bring us to the summer of 2024, when Thomas would have a single year left on his deal. I'd argue Thomas is one of the top three 6s on the planet right now, and on his day, capable of outplaying the other two head to head. Even then, I doubt anyone's offering 90m for a player with a single year left. But even if they did, the question would still be to what extent we're dependent on him, and what losing him would cost us.

If and when we have a player who can (and already has, to a significant degree) step in for him, sure; until then, the price of Thomas is above rubies.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rrgg3,t1_j6rqhzc

Sell Balogun (painful), Pepe, Mari, Lokonga (if he does well at Palace and we can get 20) Tavares or Tierney (or both and bring in another LB but probably not).

Is it going to have any repercussions? No

"People were pissed at how Aston Villa fans were pushing the narrative that they were coming for our spot. I would not call their interest in our player disrespectful in anyway. It's football. They didn't try to tap him up. They just submitted bids. Do you have any idea how disrespectful clubs can get when they really want a player? Guys are acting like this is cesc to Barca all over again. Mind you, we still did business with Barca after that truly disrespectful transfer.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r8ewk,t1_j6r7hlm

If Villa offered 50 or 60m then its comparable.,Arsenal,Yes,j6raf3x,t1_j6r7hlm

"I was initially against it as I didn't think we'd get him on a short deal, he's miles better than either Elneny or Lokonga and will be a good enough backup for the next 1.5 years at least",Arsenal,Yes,j6rgvv7,t1_j6rgond
It's normally the opposite way round,Arsenal,Yes,j6rhdt8,t1_j6rgond
It's how you know we're back with the big boys tbh. Lots of bandwagon opinions throwing a tantrum about Edu and Jorginho because 'we'll be laughed at'. As if banter is the only measure of whether Arsenal can win a title lmao.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rlgvg,t1_j6rgond

That discussion is a lot easier when you feel like the person on the other end of the phone isn't actively trying to fuck you over. You can be more open about what you want and need, it's a matter of trust.

Clubs let their players speak to other clubs and set things up to see if a deal is worth attempting. But if you don't trust them not to pull some shit then you can make it more difficult for that to happen.

Relationships and trust do matter here.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sbyxv,t1_j6s7nac

"Yeah, I'd have loved Moises but Brighton weren't kidding around sadly. I think Jorginho will actually fit our team a lot better than Chelsea's tactically. His biggest weakness is mobility but he's got great positioning and technical ability, so the fact the we love to compress the pitch, don't require our 6 to roam too much, and will have athletic inverted fullbacks either side of him will really suit his game.

Don't they have loan listing on the site?,Arsenal,Yes,j6rar05,t1_j6ran8x

Bernardo Silva is prob leaving so makes sense,Arsenal,Yes,j6sajqo,t1_j6s8m6w
Really wonder why we bought Vieira instead of him given it seems we have endless pockets.  Seems an odd choice when Maddison is a similar role but ready to go and was ripping it up.  I know he would probably have been double the cost but you'd get value for money.,Arsenal,Yes,j6s9hzi,t1_j6s8m6w
"To say nothing of the fact that when we saw ESR there last season, it was in our very earliest days of trying 433-- and often with Sambi as the 6. Trying to use that as some kind of definitive evidence against him is just silly.

We are much better at this now, and with better and improving players everywhere around the left 8-- which has, at the same time, moved and closer and closer as a role to something ESR can play, while he's been learning and developing behind the scenes.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sbhqc,t1_j6s98x0
"Agree. Xhaka playing in spots ESR is very comfortable in. Xhaka has played great this season, but the higher up the pitch he gets the more his technical abilities and creativity are exposed. I think ESR could excel there. Especially in games where we are more offensive minded.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sbfx4,t1_j6s98x0
"Yeah the system is there now for him to thrive. He can be very good there, he loves operating in xhakas channel when he‚Äôs deployed as the left wing, can‚Äôt wait to see him and Gabi together on that side. Not to mention trossard",Arsenal,Yes,j6saa70,t1_j6s98x0
It's not as impossible as it seems. They are outsiders but i've seen stranger things happen. 42 points from 18 games is obviously going to be impossible if they continue to play like they are but in general it wouldn't be a shock. The biggest obstacle is the fact they have to play 4 of the big 6 away still.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sc77h,t1_j6sbgpj
"4th probably gonna need 75 points, Newcastle and United both look good",Arsenal,Yes,j6sg8i1,t1_j6sbgpj
Bottling 2 goal leads is a perfect way to get yourself a free pass to the Championship,Arsenal,Yes,j6sumuk,t1_j6stzy3

He‚Äôd be behind Osimhen for Nigeria and not sure he‚Äôs ever played for them. Apparently is interested in the US though and he‚Äôd be a nailed on starter so I think England would have to convince him.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tghee,t1_j6tg4g5
United for me. They have a lot of money regardless of if they get CL. And CL typically keeps their owners happy and they don‚Äôt look beyond standard 2-3 signings.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tibox,t1_j6thrzf
Anyone but Chelsea. Spurs ideally because they will keep deluding themselves by keeping Kane.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tiqal,t1_j6thrzf
Would rather Spurs and I never thought I‚Äôd say that. They still won‚Äôt win anything so it doesn‚Äôt really matter where they finish as long as it‚Äôs below us.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tia95,t1_j6thrzf

I can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôve spent so much and their team looks like something you cook up in fifa. Genuinely few difference makers came in for 600m,Arsenal,Yes,j6smhi7,t1_j6sj6rr
Potter doesn't deserve any plaudits. They have ¬£60m players as 3rd choice who would start at most clubs. If Chelsea don't win the title next year he has done a poor job.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sjmwa,t1_j6sj6rr
"Things will be interesting, should they miss top 4 this year; missing out on Europe all together would be something, but missing out on the top flight is almost as significant, financially. 

They may benefit from only competing in/focusing on the league next season, but every match will be a battle. Their talent is inexperienced and those with experience are shells of their past glory. 

They‚Äôre building front to back, and no attacking talent can compensate for a porous backline and shakey keeper. 

It will take a masterstroke from Potter to make the CL next season, not that it would be at all surprising. This team looks a lot better in FIFA than it‚Äôs set to be in reality.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sm6f5,t1_j6sj6rr
I don't think people's main concerns are about Chelsea this year specifically - most know they aren't going to dent us much from here. It's the potential that they are gathering after unprecedented spending.,Arsenal,Yes,j6slj79,t1_j6sj6rr
"We shouldn‚Äôt sell Balogun, but we aren‚Äôt going to keep 3 strikers happy lmao",Arsenal,Yes,j6v4m3d,t1_j6v3sws
"A PL loan might be a good move for Balogun. If Eddie keeps improving at his current rate, will be hard to bench him for Balogun. Eddie is basically doing what we hope Balogun can do. A PL loan for Balogun and see how he gets on, somewhere like Palace might be a good move for him.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vcmje,t1_j6v3sws
Choose who you think is going to be better Nketiah or Balogun and sell the other for $50M. No brainer. We're not an oil club. We have finite resources. Use the money to build depth or reinvest in younger players. Between Jesus and Nketiah/Balogun we have the striker position locked down for four years. No need for a third with that value. And too much risk to let it keep floating. His value could easily come down from what it is right now.,Arsenal,Yes,j6vfk86,t1_j6v3sws
"538 has CL qualification at 69 points, which is lower than most years. Chelsea currently on around 7% chance.

Arsenal about to win the league while Spurs about to get relegated. Give me that timeline.,Arsenal,Yes,j6vu331,t1_j6vh04m

"Have to hope that Rice not leaving them in Jan has kept some goodwill with West Ham AND that he explicitly states he prefers us over Chelsea.

That'd be needed to not be fucked over in another bidding war",Arsenal,Yes,j6rkv0m,t1_j6rit9e
Probably Rice or Caicedo is the plan. Have to figure Chelsea will get one of them.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rjkpr,t1_j6rit9e
United basically need Harry Kane and a midfielder and they will be streets ahead of Chelsea.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r5yxj,t1_j6r5tro
United are 1 striker away from being a very strong team as well.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r5vwu,t1_j6r5tro
Chelsea are a discombobulated mess,Arsenal,Yes,j6r624x,t1_j6r5tro
Based on what? In the past they signed Lukaku Werner and Havertz and they are all shit well maybe not Havertz but still signing players and using how much you pay for them as basis for their talent is a disaster.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r7203,t1_j6r5tro
"Meh, come summer I don't think there stance will be as stubborn, they just really want to get European football and in the summer they can get a proper replacement and go again",Arsenal,Yes,j6r9k0a,t1_j6r8nqy
"a chelsea fan was in the DD thread yesterday and told me he's kinda always been like that. just one person's perspective tho! 

but i wouldn't be surprised if a lot of jorginho's ""lost legs"" were just systemic issues with late tuchel and potter, and also a lack of kante

which is good for us because in place of kante, we have positional play that won't leave him stranded in the middle of nowhere with acres of space to dribble around him like a cone",Arsenal,Yes,j6rgec3,t1_j6rg1v7
He has always been slow.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rga16,t1_j6rg1v7
"> Jorginho has never had the ability to turn on a dime under pressure

Jorginho does this very well to be fair. 

> drive forward 20 yards to open up space like Partey can.

But not this as he can't carry. 

He compensates for that with his line breaking passing which he would have the chance to do at Arsenal with options ahead of him running in space.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rlxek,t1_j6rkrzt
"I really doubt Arteta would assign him the same tasks as Partey, he'd probably tweak the system a bit",Arsenal,Yes,j6rl3sv,t1_j6rkrzt
This season is the first season that partey had performed better than Jorginho in his entire career btw,Arsenal,Yes,j6rlwjd,t1_j6rkrzt
I am not concerned at all like not any more than I would be to face the likes of Brentford or Leeds away. We‚Äôve been playing some really good stuff. I have no doubt we will see what we‚Äôve been seeing all season long. Maybe even a thrashing (anulo mufa),Arsenal,Yes,j6rxj56,t1_j6rueea
The shift has been weird with Everton cos all I remember is us dicking them constantly at Goodison and just think of the opening day of the season where we thumped them and Denilson scored a banger.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rusz5,t1_j6rueea
"Valid concern but I see our mentality being much better than in past years. This is one a late Wenger team would lose 2-1, easily.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rv64k,t1_j6rueea
"They‚Äôre set at striker, with 3 more years of 30 year old Lukaku making ¬£16.9m, annually",Arsenal,Yes,j6sguyt,t1_j6sggw8
They'll just spend more money,Arsenal,Yes,j6sisb6,t1_j6sggw8
"He would have to deal with big egos as well, or at the least, players who cause a lot of problems to the club's environment and culture. Take Ziyech as an example. 

For us, Arteta had to deal with Ozil and Auba",Arsenal,Yes,j6t2qlc,t1_j6t1vlh
"Chelsea really feel like a soul-less club.  They aren't built for a coach to spend a long time building up players and establishing a culture.  They buy-loan-liquidate-change coaches-repeat.  Yeah they have won trophies, so it can achieve that kind of success.  But it seems like a horrible mess to be a supporter of.  How can you have any real connection to the club?",Arsenal,Yes,j6t62nr,t1_j6t1vlh
"Now that they have spent 300 mill in this window, don‚Äôt think Potter will survive two months if their performance doesn‚Äôt improve drastically. It is not even Boelhy, the spoilt Chelsea fans will be the first to show him the way out.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t43g9,t1_j6t1vlh
"Its quite simple really. 

We had Auba and Laca starting with Gabi and Eddie as backups for them. When they both left, Martinelli became the undisputed starter while Jesus came in to be our starting striker. 

Now we brought in Trossard to compete with Gabi on the left, but Eddie has proven himself to be quite capable as competition for the #9 spot. Even thoufh Balogun looks quite good, he‚Äôd be third option and not really the same as Gabi, even when he first cane in. 

Considering the value we could get for him and how much depth we need in other areas (right wing and midfield especially) it doesnt make sense to hold onto an asset like him when the money would have a greater impact on depth elsewhere",Arsenal,Yes,j6t92c5,t1_j6t855d
"I know Balogun is a really exciting prospect and we ought to give him a chance but
- We have 2 established strikers who are playing well
- Both our strikers are young and there is no pathway for Balogun in the future
- We don‚Äôt fix something until it‚Äôs broken and rn the 2 strikers are relatively happy with the game time and Arsenal is happy about their performances.

Why people are insisting on selling him this summer because his stocks will be the highest right now and we might not get a better opportunity to extract most value from him. We need to learn when to sell (Remember AMN) and I think we should maybe put a sell-on or buyback clause and defo sell him.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t96gg,t1_j6t855d
The sale idea is because we already have two strikers.,Arsenal,Yes,j6t8uvo,t1_j6t855d
"1 ) To make some sales

2 ) No one on god's green earth carries 3 strikers let alone a team that only plays a 4-3-3 lol

3 ) I doubt he wants to come back here and warm bench

4) We have 2 good strikers right now.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tan8k,t1_j6t855d
"We have two elite strikers on five year contracts. Attachment to Hale End kids aside, he is a good prospect in the market. Good for the club, will get a good fee. Good for Flo, he could be the starting striker for a LOT of teams in any of the top leagues",Arsenal,Yes,j6t98w1,t1_j6t855d
[deleted],Arsenal,Yes,j6t8vd1,t1_j6t855d
"I'd obviously like to keep him to see what he can do first but sensibly it'd make sense to sell because he'll have 2 years left so it's a good time to sell, he must be worth 40mill, and we don't really need him.

Alternatively you sell Jesus, Eddie takes the no.1 spot and Balogun is no.2. which seems a bit illogical given how good Jesus is for us as both what he brings himself and the different options he gives us with Nketiah who is a different type of striker.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tccbd,t1_j6t855d
"Lol, let them ask for him.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tnffq,t1_j6tnayt

"Benfica topped their UCL group which had PSG and he was instrumental in both games. In fact, Benfica was better in the midfield battle and Enzo was one of their best performers.

I also think they massively overpaid but they also overpaid for many other players.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r5od5,t1_j6r52x2
"No one is 120m good unless you are a generational talent ala Mbappe etc.

Chelsea have just fucked the market",Arsenal,Yes,j6r5tbb,t1_j6r52x2
Look at his fbref data. For me he's up there with any midfielder under 23 in the world.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r5wep,t1_j6r52x2
I don't think that's true. Reece James and Thiago Silva could possibly get into our starting eleven. Even Enzo Fernandez and Mudryk seem really good.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r93j9,t1_j6r8o8x
Next summer is where all eyes will be on the board. We're finally back at the big boys table. Top players that cost top money want to join us. We can't miss out on players like that anymore.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rix55,t1_j6rha7b
"Here's the thing tho, those fees are not insane anymore. They are now just the market prices. So, if we are to sign a player like Caicedo, or Rice, or anyone like that, whether this January or in the summer or whenever, we will have to actually pay one of those ""insane"" fees. 

And so far, in 6 windows under Arteta, we still haven't done it once. Our club record signing is still from before Arteta, that's basically ancient history in football terms. Every rival has set a new record in that meantime except us. 

So while I agree that we did a decent job with our Plan B, the fact that we failed on Plan A yet again leaves me very skeptical that we will actually sign Caicedo or Rice in the summer either. We seem to have a ceiling on the transfers we are able to secure, and it's way lower than all of our rivals' ceilings (not just Chelsea either).

In other words, decent window but I'm just tired Robbie",Arsenal,Yes,j6ri8c1,t1_j6rha7b
"No no. I'm not going to change your mind. I agree with you.

Think Jesus is going to have to accept he will be played out wide at one point, as much as I love his silky smooth cutting through the lines and assists the number 9 needs to score a lot of goals and both eddie and balogun have a way better goals per game than him",Arsenal,Yes,j6ttj1x,t1_j6tsz5b
">ither Jesus plays RW, or we sell him or Eddie.

hold your horsies, is France.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ttf92,t1_j6tsz5b
cant wait for chelsea at home. its going to feel damn good thrashing them.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rly7m,t1_j6rjgoy
"Your problem is that first sentence.

It's not someone else's money, they're not a sportwashing vehicle where the value is how well the club is performing and Boehly isn't the main shareholder.

The govt made them promise to invest ¬£1.75b into the club so it is presumably factored into the takeover costs but one of the major shareholders is an investment fund, another is a property developer and these people will be looking for a return unlike Roman or middle Eastern monarchies.

Now he may be going for a turbocharged version of a young team that can grow together and he needs to because quite frankly he's tied himself to them as much as they are tied to the club but so far he's not shown much patience with managers and with the famously impatient Chelsea fans that he seems to be trying to bribe to stay inside if he's going to try and give project managers a quick turnaround demand he's going to fail.

Equally as we all know the Jose's and the Contes of this world expect to be backed with new players to get their instant success and that's going to need more spending and at some point jettisoning someone on these long contracts.

They've already got an issue of five of their new players not being allowed to be registered for Europe, even with a huge clear out one season of Jose could push those issues again and all the time you're adding to that yearly amortisation bill.",Arsenal,Yes,j6srn1s,t1_j6spa8a

"They are deservedly 10th right now and have largely spent on project players.

Might Enzo and Mudryk become world class? They absolutely have the potential, but they are a long ways off.

Success right now for Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, United is beating City and winning trophies. That's very, very hard as we are about to find out one way or the other.

And that's not even mentioning Newcastle and Spurs, who are currently better than Chelsea as well.

Chelsea can fail just simply by *one* of City, Arsenal, United, Liverpool, Newcastle or even Spurs being consistently better than they are over the near future. That's the same for Arsenal as well.

"Mudryk or Enzo have not done anything in their careers to prove their price tags yet and it‚Äôs far from a guarantee. They‚Äôre also on 8.5 year contracts. A lot can happen in 8.5 years, for good or bad.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t5qa7,t1_j6spa8a

Agree with you but the one thing that might work in their favour is that there might be competition amongst other clubs for some of the players they want to offload due to the fact these players are all very young. It might work it might not... It would be fun for us view from the sideline in the next few windows.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r9lve,t1_j6r9cby
"Not particularly. As much as I hate them, this kinda makes sense. 

They're obliged to invest 1.75b as a part of the take over process. Might as well put it on the highest rated youngsters on the market right now. 

Long contracts help with amortization. 

Even if Mudryk or Enzo is a huge flop, there'll always be some taker for them. iirc West Ham bought famous liverpool flop Andy Carroll for 15 million!",Arsenal,Yes,j6rbw0s,t1_j6r9cby
"Depends what you mean by strongest.

In terms of talent in the league - Yes.

In terms of teams having their shit together - No.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rb50d,t1_j6rb010
"Top teams are weaker but the rest barring a couple of exceptions are better than ever, and possess more talent than ever.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rbwe7,t1_j6rb010
"Probably not. Except for us, Newcastle, United, brentford, Fulham and Brighton every team is having a bad season",Arsenal,Yes,j6rbifi,t1_j6rb010
He‚Äôs probably had the most engagement in his career over the past couple of days from winding up Arsenal fans. Stands to reason he‚Äôll keep it up for a while.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rc10w,t1_j6rbpsw
The most depressing thing about our backing out of the Caicedo deal isn‚Äôt that we didn‚Äôt get the player. It‚Äôs that he won.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rc44k,t1_j6rbpsw
Transfer windows are exciting but I'm so glad we can just focus on the actual football now,Arsenal,Yes,j6reslm,t1_j6renpf
Feels like football is just a thing that happens in between transfer windows now,Arsenal,Yes,j6rfphb,t1_j6renpf
"Why is such important?

Let's say we identify a very mediocre player as our #1 target. One summer we spent months chasing Joel Campbell. Is it good we lock that down?

If we identify Mbappe and he doesnt come, is that bad?

Let's just look at the squad come sept1",Arsenal,Yes,j6tmyxo,t1_j6tk9sv
"No idea. Who knows who the number 1 target will be come summer anyway.

I'm 1000% confident they'll get us good players.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tm1ds,t1_j6tk9sv
"I 100% agree, it's a little concerning we seem to struggle to tie down our top targets. Even players like Zinny and Jesus were 2nd choice and have to feel the arteta connection helped the deal more than anything.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r63r9,t1_j6r3wdt
Since Arteta came in we‚Äôve only made one key signing in midfield which was Partey (unless you include √òdegaard). Quite mad,Arsenal,Yes,j6r4455,t1_j6r3wdt
"Really doubt Potter wanted him leaving at this point, I'm sure he'd have preferred Gallagher to go.  Played George in 99% of games. 

We now have the best pair of DM's in the league so.....  bit daft being anything but happy.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4l4p,t1_j6r3wdt
"I guess because of Elneny we hadn't made a serious effort before. But atleast they showed interest for signing Rice in summer.

But even if we didn't get Caicedo what are our other options? We were linked with Bamba and most players didn't want to leave mid season. Considering other options Jorginho is a safe bet with less price that doesn't affect us in anyway.

But come summer if we don't sign someone, then we should question Edu but for now it's ok",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4au5,t1_j6r3wdt
"we always had a back up, no one was willing to accept it. it was el neny

we wouldn't have signed jorginho as a back up if our back up hadn't gotten injured",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4bdl,t1_j6r3wdt
Jorginho said in his interview that Arteta has tried to get him a few times. Obviously Arteta thinks that he has something to offer in midfield as a backup to Partey. It also aligns with the 300k passes in the opponents' half that Arteta mentioned. Pretty clear what the idea is there for 6 months.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r5kvs,t1_j6r3wdt
I think Liverpool might be in a bit of trouble as well tbh over the next 2-3 years. I see them perma dropping to Europa/conference for a little stretch.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rwpz4,t1_j6rp5lm
"Chelsea lost their only consistently fit midfielder. They spent too much money on forwards.

I'm not sure how much Liverpool can spend in the summer. No CL + they blew their warchest on Nunez and Gakpo",Arsenal,Yes,j6rpc48,t1_j6rp5lm
"Have you seen how much they have to spend in the summer on the current loaned in players? Along with the amount of players out on loan, it's insane. Their summer window is going to be fun to watch.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rr5am,t1_j6rp5lm
"If we end up throwing the title and the EL and end up with nothing then yes it‚Äôs OK to complain about the action we took in this window. But the club have got us 5 points top at the halfway point, I think they‚Äôve earned a bit of trust",Arsenal,Yes,j6r7h6s,t1_j6r78t2
Who would be the last statement signing for us?,Arsenal,Yes,j6rfvt5,t1_j6rfqof
"Not if City have anything to do with it tbh. They are richer than us, can offer him more wages and even if we win the league they are still in contention for it for years to come. I‚Äôm not even going to get my hopes up a bit.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rh83j,t1_j6rfqof
"We got Odegarad. 

Lokonga was a mistake but it had nothing to do with selling Willock.",Arsenal,Yes,j6socp2,t1_j6smyap
"If you want to think of signings offsetting one another, it was really Willock for √òdegaard-- which is a deal I'd take all day long and twice on Sundays.

I'd have been quite happy to sign √òdegaard and keep Willock, but that was a good deal all round: we got a good fee for a good young player we developed; Newcastle got a good player they needed at a reasonable price; Willock got a move to a side where he'd get plenty of minutes.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sndnn,t1_j6smyap
"They are two separate deals though. We didn't buy Lokonga because we sold Willock, we sold Willock because he was extremely mediocre and the money we received was fantastic. Lokonga has turned out to be underwhelming but when signing youngsters there's no guarantee they are going to reach their potential.

So yeah, it was a smart move. It just didn't work out as well as we hoped.",Arsenal,Yes,j6snlyj,t1_j6smyap

"Jorginho is extremely durable (https://www.transfermarkt.com/jorginho/verletzungen/spieler/102017), as is Xhaka. We‚Äôre technically lighter in midfield, but I wouldn‚Äôt be concerned. 

Elneny was barely fit so while it is 2 out, we never really relied on him this season anyway.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rnqoq,t1_j6rmh3t
nah a big part of our fans are just trash and would turn on him regardless,Arsenal,Yes,j6tq12x,t1_j6toiz5
"I think some people expect too much from a 22 year old trying to learn one of the most physically and mentally demanding positions in the sport, while playing in a new country in the most competitive league. He just turned 23 in October and needs minutes to iron out his game. You pay for experience with points, and Arsenal haven‚Äôt been afforded the luxury of being able to throw away points since he‚Äôs signed.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tprn3,t1_j6toiz5
"I personally didn't watch the said scene. My opinion of the guy is built on what I see in game. And if the documentary nailed the same conclusion, it's Lokonga that has to work on himself.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tp72a,t1_j6toiz5
Nah his poor performance is the reason most fans have turned on him. If he had performed well after that clip people would have used it to say ‚Äòlook he took eddies advice and stepped up‚Äô,Arsenal,Yes,j6tsb91,t1_j6toiz5
"I can‚Äôt wait for the ‚Äúleave Chelsea, win the league‚Äù memes man",Arsenal,Yes,j6rc8vq,t1_j6rc2eh
"None of those challenges really seemed sustainable.  In this one we've reinforced the squad where it needed it. Attacking cover, midfield cover and cb cover.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rh6bx,t1_j6rghny
Fuck (and I can not stress this enough) Vlahovic,Arsenal,Yes,j6sganz,t1_j6sf90q
I have no interest after the disrespect he/his entourage showed the club last January. I think he‚Äôs off the club‚Äôs recruitment list because of it.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sh5w4,t1_j6sf90q
"Nah. I'm very very happy with our forwards at this point. What I want the club to focus on is a midfield revamp, can't let it get to the point where our mids are too old to run anymore like Liverpool has

Priority targets should be zubimendi and rice",Arsenal,Yes,j6sfxc6,t1_j6sf90q
"This comes up every now and again but a lot of dominos have to be in place.

First we have to decide that Jesus is a winger. Then we decide that Trossard is a CM/8/10 on the left. After that, we also decide that one of Vieira and ESR has to leave, either permanently or loan. 

Then we also have to hope both Chelsea and Manchester United are insane not to realise they need actual 9s.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sik4v,t1_j6sf90q
Chelsea needs a Striker they will be willing to pay 100m for him.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sgn99,t1_j6sf90q
Locatelli first,Arsenal,Yes,j6sg498,t1_j6sf90q
"He had his chance.

We've also got two first team strikers and we need the long term successors to Partey and Xhaka and still that elusive Saka rotation firsr",Arsenal,Yes,j6shdvp,t1_j6sf90q
Hes got the number 9 Jersey he will be happy lol. Let the best talent emerge.,Arsenal,Yes,j6umg65,t1_j6ulog2
Jesus has said in interviews he prefers to play on the wing. I doubt he'd be that upset about it,Arsenal,Yes,j6ut1oq,t1_j6ulog2
I think he'll bond with the Brazilians bc he speaks Portuguese and was born there.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rctwp,t1_j6rcisd

New best friend: granit xhaka,Arsenal,Yes,j6rcovq,t1_j6rcisd
our worst transfer windows are all the ones from 15/16 to Artetas first summer window in 20/21. Not a single good transfer window in there.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rpng4,t1_j6rny5w
"Nah there's no place for him with √òdegaard, ESR and Fabio here.",Arsenal,Yes,j6szp92,t1_j6syoi7
"No, he's not going to be happy rotating, he's bloody expensive and in ideal world ESR does the same thing for us.",Arsenal,Yes,j6szmg3,t1_j6syoi7

Why on earth would we be moving for a striker in the summer lol,Arsenal,Yes,j6tt1fq,t1_j6trjur
"Through June 2025.  We might have an option on top, we like to do that.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ts8o8,t1_j6trjur
Unlikely to go for an out and out striker. I think we will look for someone that covers Saka's position and is flexible enough to fill in centrally and on the left if needed.,Arsenal,Yes,j6ttz7w,t1_j6trjur

"Obviously Newcastle.

There is literally no situation where I would want Man United win a trophy, even if it's against Spurs.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ub9yw,t1_j6u8z6j
Newcastle. Not a fan of the Saudi money but listening to United fans suddenly rating the EFL cup and wanking over ten shags will be cringe,Arsenal,Yes,j6ualn2,t1_j6u8z6j

Yes yes we get it edu bad,Arsenal,Yes,j6tegjc,t1_j6tec9h

lol you are delusional if you actually believe this,Arsenal,Yes,j6tex0y,t1_j6tec9h
"If you watched Partey at WC, you'd have seen him playing right side of a three and it wasn't pretty. He moves languidly round the pitch and is a terrible presser. He only shows great athleticism in short bursts, best keep him in the middle. 

I do believe Jorginho would do well with a ball winning left 8 though. Pair him with Declan Rice who can drop back regularly and cover him and zinny for example.",Arsenal,Yes,j6upau0,t1_j6un8at
I think it works fine but however it is unwise to play both number 6s on the field.,Arsenal,Yes,j6upgap,t1_j6un8at
If Xhaka hurt Viera will fill that spot. That is the plan (hence Lakonga loan). Zinny probably oir emergency 8 if Viera stink it up,Arsenal,Yes,j6uqjvv,t1_j6un8at
Onana and Kone are not better than Jorginho btw. People just want them because they think ~~a dm has to be a tough black guy~~ every signing has to be some young player with potential. FIFY,Arsenal,Yes,j6t5j06,t1_j6t4cx8
"they aren‚Äôt better than Jorginho, but that‚Äôs a very weird comment to make",Arsenal,Yes,j6t5tc4,t1_j6t4cx8
They're both projects to become better than Jorginho though.,Arsenal,Yes,j6t6mjg,t1_j6t4cx8
"Have no idea about Kone, but, if we are talking about Onana from Everton, he will never be better than Jorginho in the future, as well. He is physically a beast, but, terribly inconsistent on the ball and very rash off it. Don‚Äôt think technique and passing can be improved significantly beyond a certain age.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t77b6,t1_j6t4cx8
"Kone isn't even a DM. 

People just didn't want us to do business with Chelsea.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t93qd,t1_j6t4cx8

I love how everyone - except Chelsea fans- are in agreement that Potter will not last at the club. I almost feel sorry for him. Insane recruitment that he has no part in and the expectations will be so high.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rk4se,t1_j6rk0jk
"Let's see those players gel on the pitch before we judge. This can be a disaster for Chelsea. A bloke from the Ukranian league for 100 mil, a guy with just a great WC for 120 mil - a bunch of players for 30, 40 mil, without much thinking... It could go very wrong.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rkrwu,t1_j6rk0jk

I think there's been a big overreaction to his form, ok he's hasn't been getting g/a the past few games but he has still looked dangerous. 

But saying that I would be tempted to start Trossard. He's looked electric.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sutmn,t1_j6su5x2
"This year?

Or three games...

Mate.",Arsenal,Yes,j6svp96,t1_j6su5x2
"Martinelli has been excellent, doing exactly what Arteta has asked of him in Jesus' absence: taking the opposing RB and at least one other defender out of the game.

And he's still been creating, despite being constantly double-teamed, and with far fewer options than Saka has on our right.

I expect we'll see Trossard-- but because he's good, not because Martinelli has been bad.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sxgif,t1_j6su5x2

"*""Here have some Ligue 1 players, be right!""*",Arsenal,Yes,j6tipdo,t1_j6ti5mj
"Nah man no way are we even loaning balogun to that shitstain of a club. He deserves better, by the very least I'm thinkin uncle vieira",Arsenal,Yes,j6titg7,t1_j6ti5mj
"I mean, Mikel has never said that Partey's profile is his ideal preference for a 6 in his dream system. The fact he tried to sign Jorginho multiple times and that City wanted him when Jorginho was at Napoli suggests that. Partey playing there might just be dealing with the best he has available to him right now. Even though Partey is playing at an elite level.

Reading Ornstein's quotes over the last few days it seems Zubimendi was the priority midfield signing, Caicedo was the second choice. He probably wants a more Busquests style player at the 6 position in the future.

Wouldn't surprise me if our priority is Rice and Zubimendi in the Summer.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rqeek,t1_j6rpz6i
"I'll ring the club and inform them that u/imeternallysuffering doesn't trust edu to sell. We'll get someone else in to do the job, who do you recommend?",Arsenal,Yes,j6tig9x,t1_j6ti51w
"We almost this lad on a free transfer. He even said his goodbyes. We re-signed him at the 11th hour and preserved his value, loaned him to an ideal set up...now his value is up from what could have been zero...and you're still questioning the decision makers?",Arsenal,Yes,j6tiwuj,t1_j6ti51w
No one asked,Arsenal,Yes,j6tiq0m,t1_j6ti51w
I think we starting to look that way. Like in the City FA Cup game we limited City quite a lot having made like 6 changes to what would be ourr normal starting lineup whereas they played more or less a full strength side. Adding more quality players like Jorginho I think we'll make it further into these competitions and distribute the mins around the squad players more evenly,Arsenal,Yes,j6uk20s,t1_j6ujkf1
"no team can, not even City. they literally had to sell jesus and sterling. also sold aguero and ferran before

the only senior star that was happy to be a rotation was gundogan,  but he could play multiple positions so he's the perfect cover for that.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w4wiq,t1_j6ujkf1
"Caicedo was just not available. If we don't get help in CM, we are fucked but if we waste funds on players that won't improve us much, then we should spend as little as possible, a la Jorginho. Now if those funds are not added to pile of cash to get Rice, Camavinga or any of my pipe dreams then I will be mad at Edu. Mudryk looks to be one we will regret but imagine if spunking 80 mil out  didn't turn out well for us, our summer would be impacted. So I am learning to trust the process even when it looks shit because I remember when I didn't trust as much and turned out I was wrong.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tety3,t1_j6tdeto
"Brighton are a very admirable club

Their success is success for the sport 

I hope that they can sustain their model because big clubs are trying to pick them to the bone and while they have done remarkably well to stay successful I‚Äôm not sure that they can continue to consistently replace their quality players and staff with comparable quality",Arsenal,Yes,j6vecjl,t1_j6vbqhg
Idk why u guys don‚Äôt like Brighton all of a sudden. They didn‚Äôt wanna sell one of their best players what‚Äôs the big deal here?,Arsenal,Yes,j6vc13k,t1_j6vbqhg
"I honestly don't have much against Brighton, we got Trossard. They didn't want to sell Caicedo and made it really clear, they did not want to sell. Is it their fault for not accepting offers they didn't want to take? If Chelsea however had bid 80m and got a deal done, I'd be a bit more pissed off.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vc6un,t1_j6vbqhg
"Yup, we‚Äôre owed their players!

This is so weird, the teams most likely in the Europa and Conference league positions besides Brighton will be Chelsea, Liverpool, and Newcastle/Spurs. I would 100x rather a well run team that plays a really nice style be in that spot over fucking Chelsea and Spurs. 

The transfer saga had absolutely no bearing on how I feel about Brighton and besides us, don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a team I root for more than Brighton. Brentford too.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vechc,t1_j6vbqhg
ESR should not be for sale.,Arsenal,Yes,j6u0bu3,t1_j6tyzw5
That's not really how it works. I agree there should be some sales eventually but ESR hasn't been used in this new arsenal yet and he could feasibly replace Xhaka in his role.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tzh5n,t1_j6tyzw5

"Ignoring how unbelievablely stupid this take is for a second, palace is probably the last team in the league that would racially profile a black man.

edit: lmfao u/pewpew62 still tried to delete this:

> I remember Vieira saying last year that he wanted more physicality in his team, seems as though palace recruitment just racially profiled Sambi and assumed he's physical because he's black. He's is not really great at anything in particular so I don't see how he fits into a midtable potentially relegation threatened team where you need grafters and/or creative outlets. I don't foresee him getting much game time **although I hope I'm wrong.**

I can‚Äôt see our first choice midfield being broken up. They are in the middle of a title challenge and are having great seasons; they deserve to finish the job unless form falls off of a cliff. But Jorginho will get his games for us.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sjosh,t1_j6sivsw
"I can't imagine it tbh. From what Chelsea fans are saying, Jorgi has been playing side to side football for too long. He's just here to do Elnenny's job.",Arsenal,Yes,j6skldf,t1_j6sivsw
Absolutely no way. I can see him starting a PL game if we have a tougher Europa game midweek but there's no way we change up the best midfield in the league.,Arsenal,Yes,j6syb2t,t1_j6sivsw

"No, a member of the team was not up to the level required, and didn't seem to take in what Ode was saying hence the escalation.",Arsenal,Yes,j6st78q,t1_j6ss8fl
"The thing you're missing is obvious context.

These players bust their ass in training every day. It's why we are top of the league. They do the video sessions. They have gave it their all in matches.

Now, Ode is our captain. He sees someone not doing the basics. The stuff they have done 1000 times in training, been shown in video.

Everyone else is doing their job.",Arsenal,Yes,j6su5zq,t1_j6ss8fl

"I‚Äôm ok with it. Collectively we cannot carry passengers and Lakongo wasn‚Äôt switched on and didn‚Äôt track his runners.

">too small to hold it up in the PL

He‚Äôs listed as 5‚Äô10 which is the same height as Jesus and only an inch shorter than Eddie. Not to mention he actually seems taller than that- looked taller than Henry.
Size and weight don‚Äôt matter, give him a season to get in the gym and he‚Äôll be fine.

Selling the top goalscorer in a top 5 league for 25m+ is ridiculous, especially considering how young he is. If he was just a Reims player, they would be asking twice that minimum lmao",Arsenal,Yes,j6uny4p,t1_j6umpdj

Oh is this sale only for silver members? I always have the tab open at work so today when I got in I refreshed the page and i was added into the queue around 9:23. I'm a red member though so I guess I wont be able to buy anything.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rc2vz,t1_j6rbx0h

I dont see any world in which Jorginho usurps Saka as the pen taker unless he's not on the pitch.,Arsenal,Yes,j6riluq,t1_j6rhx02
They will have settled the priority taker in training.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rj74k,t1_j6rhx02
"Jorge is a better penalty taker but 90% of taking a penalty is having the balls to do it calmly so it really doesn't matter.

Bonus for Saka is the stat padding that rival fans only use to rate players.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ridfg,t1_j6rhx02
"He is naturally a right back. He wasn't great when he initially joined City, but became world class when he was moved to left back

This season he has failed to replicate that form, so Pep became increasingly hesitant to play him",Arsenal,Yes,j6rr7c4,t1_j6roe0o
Hard to say. Every player Chelsea have signed in that second striker mould has failed to adapt to the Premier League so far so will just have to wait and see.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rsbvz,t1_j6rrwez
Don‚Äôt trust bundesliga stats until they replicate them somewhere else.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rvhks,t1_j6rrwez
"Every time a player makes contact with the ball it‚Äôs a touch. However, most models take an instance of possession as one touch so if I trap the ball take 3 touches and then pass it that still only counts as one statistical touch. A pass is an attempt to play the ball to another player.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ruzxk,t1_j6rufuu
"A touch is from being in possession of the ball until you're not, so it can end with a pass, shot, or dispossession.

A pass is giving the ball to your teammate.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ruvhj,t1_j6rufuu
"If you receive the ball and lose it to say a tackle or whatever it‚Äôs still a touch. 

If you release the ball intentionally towards a player it‚Äôs a pass. 

If you release the ball intentionally towards a player and the player gains a touch it‚Äôs a completed pass

Basically - touch is on receipt. Pass or shot is on release. Completed pass and shot on target are successful releases.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ruvwn,t1_j6rufuu

Yes i also think he can cover for Xhaka,Arsenal,Yes,j6sir6x,t1_j6si72t

More than you believe....

I'm not sure it's likely, though. I've moved on from Caicedo and have decided it's absolutely imperative that Edu gets Camavinga out of Real Madrid.

"Hard questions all through. I personally have no clue what we are trying to do in midfield. 

All our targets ‚Äî Rice, Camavinga, Zubimendi, Caicedo. Then the ones we have‚Äî Partey, Xhaka, Lokonga, Elneny, Jorginho. 

The ones we have are conservative pivots. Good in ball progression, winning it and possession.  They don't exactly shine that bright in the final third. 

The ones we are targeting are the same regardless how many people are trying to wish into existence, their powers in the final third. They're meh there

I have a personal want I've been saying on here‚Äî my hatred for City/Barca like single pivots. I want a little bit of caution( 2CMS) especially in big games or tournaments. MAYBE that's what we are looking at? Maybe we want a Gundogan and a Rodri? Maybe a Rice and Zubimendi? Instead of a Rice and ESR/ Rodri and Silva. 

Maybe we want an 8 that's balanced the 6/8 role well. Because I kid you not, I rather Rice - Zubimendi, than Rice - ESR.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tbkob,t1_j6sx596

"So, the strategy from now on is just overpay for every target immediately. Should have just offered 90M straight away despite us potentially not having that and the player not being with that? 

Caicedo isn't worth more than our initial bid. We have to get close to Brightons valuation, but we also have to give consideration of our own. This 'failure' happens at every single football club. Its not a failure, its the game.

Right now you all want to have your cake and eat it.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rbws1,t1_j6rbbj3

"Aside from the ethical stand point in football of bigger clubs being able to just throw money at a problem in the hope that it fixes, these prices are not sustainable and will have an impact on everything in football.

Costs of players go up and everything follows, from sponsorships, to ticket prices to merchandise. The more money that flows through the game, the more corruption etc 

Also, real life inflation levels whilst only being temporary and likely to go down are still high, so less people will be able to afford to support their club in that way.

Given the size of clubs, how they are run in terms of a business are absolutely insane and don't work in any other sector. And they're starting to not work in football, see United's financial issues.

I love the work Arteta has done so far, but essentially relying on him to continue getting it right every time is doomed to fail. No one is perfect and whilst we can afford to make the odd mistake, clubs like Chelsea are able to drop 80m on a keeper, 100m on a striker, 105m on a midfielder and if they don't work out they just throw more and more money at it until something sticks.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4f37,t1_j6r41mv

His attacking contributions this season have almost preposterously outstripped his historical average, especially through our first 12 matches (though admittedly regressing of late).

Imo just like Eddie, we haven‚Äôt even seen Balo‚Äôs real and true potential yet and he‚Äôs already scoring better figures than some strikers in their prime in Ligue 1. If we sell him to say a Dortmund and he becomes a 60-70m striker for them, would be one that got away.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t9ufi,t1_j6t8vd1
No way we only get 30 million for him. I know Arsenal is bad at selling players but he‚Äôs English and is tearing up league 1. If we don‚Äôt get at least ¬£60 million we have failed immensely.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tdo3l,t1_j6t8vd1
"Plan A was Mudryk. Who was definitely not worth ¬£89m no matter how you justify it. Caicedo, admittedly, would've been a perfect signing. But he simply wasn't for sale. I don't know why people don't understand that.

Remember that 5 of those 6 windows happened when we were 8th and 5th. In the summer, with potential champions league and the money that comes with it, I'm positive we'll be able to get the players we want. The ceiling can be raised and the knock will hit different. This window alone, our top choices wanted to leave at the hint of being able to join us.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rsokn,t1_j6ri8c1
"I also think his smart positioning and cut off ability will help offset some of his lack of pace, and he'll sit deeper relative to where Partey would push up given Jorginho's abilities on the ball I think he'll still be effective in progressive passes from slightly deeper.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r45xc,t1_j6r3whi
"I reckon when Rice first comes in he‚Äôll play as an 8, maybe for the first 1-2 seasons, then he‚Äôll eventually get moulded into a 6 as Partey‚Äôs successor",Arsenal,Yes,j6r6qtk,t1_j6r6msu
Yeah I vaguely remember that's his trait- never being fit. Wild risk,Arsenal,Yes,j6rs1vk,t1_j6rrrls

"Liverpool already plans to buy 2 midfielders in the summer, and Chelsea's season is a write-off, but you can already see the improvement, next season they will be levels above spurs with the rest of the top 6 clubs. It's fine if you don't believe me, but next year when the rest of the 5 take spurs to the cleaners we can both enjoy it. plus spurs don't have money either. they spent a ridiculous amount of money, I think people forget that.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rq058,t1_j6rpc48
"I remember the dark days of ""we shouldn't sign Ode over Willock because Willock guarantees 10+ goals a year and Ode doesn't shoot.""

What disrespect?,Arsenal,Yes,j6sixk9,t1_j6sh5w4
I mean are you sure? He left City for more game time. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be content with being a bench player just because he has the shirt.,Arsenal,Yes,j6uoo7m,t1_j6umg65
"Knowing how versatile Maddison is, he can play as an 8,10 or even as a winger. We have brilliant starters at all those positions now, but he can provide solid competition at all those spots.",Arsenal,Yes,j6szmja,t1_j6syyoq
"There are very few players on the market better than Balo/Eddie, and both are still improving.

"Holding isn't going anywhere. 

He's a leader, he's homegrown and he's a happy, solid backup in his prime years.

But what if selling Balogun to Man U meant we get Bellingham,Arsenal,Yes,j6vip62,t1_j6vimxa
I say it's delusional to pretend we aren't dog shit at selling players.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tfamw,t1_j6tex0y
"We have Nkunku coming in the summer and will most likely sign Felix on a permanent deal. Before this year Mount was one of the best young English players in the league we‚Äôll see if he regains his form. The 10/8 largely looks set. Striker is a hole we‚Äôll see what happens there. 

Defensively we signed Badiashile who look immense so far next to Silva. Fofana is getting healthy and next year we‚Äôll have the best young CB in the league back from loan at Brighton. Chilwell and Cuca LB and Reece and Gusto RB defense will be fine. Only holes in the squad are striker and a proper 6 and maybe some more midfield depth",Arsenal,Yes,j6ruphj,t1_j6rku9b
You don't think they'll go ballistic in the summer on replacing those areas? In this January window alone they have spent TWICE as much as the other top 4 leagues combined.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rl83g,t1_j6rku9b
It's his own fault for going to Chelsea of all clubs.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rk8eh,t1_j6rk4se
You are right but in spite of that they still win a lot. Having lots of failures doesn't matter when you can continually replace them until you get it right.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rkkg8,t1_j6rkequ
In the last 10 years alone they have won every single trophy and that's with a fraction of the backing we are seeing right now.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rkqcn,t1_j6rkn07
"Reiterating my comment down below as well, we have been extremely fair with Brighton everytime we have dealt with them. 50 mil for Ben White, around 25 mil for a 28 yo Trossard with a running down contract. 

Then we offer in excess of ‚Ç¨70 mil for Caicedo and Brighton get butthurt. These guys got him for 3-4 mil half a season ago like calm down lmao.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r5x9s,t1_j6r5qi2
I'm not worried. But we should have got the player in doing so.  Ruining the relationship and leaving with nothing is the worst possible outcome,Arsenal,Yes,j6r713b,t1_j6r6meh
Because we persisted after the 1st bid,Arsenal,Yes,j6r65mz,t1_j6r5ufp
I'm not overtly negative about every aspect of the club so no. I back the academy lads way more than most for example.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r6z2j,t1_j6r6i9s
He should have accepted a wage which was suitable for a player of his level then !,Arsenal,Yes,j6ubr8d,t1_j6u6en3
He still deliberately fucked over the club that stood by him just to end up on the wrong side of Iberia,Arsenal,Yes,j6u75y1,t1_j6u6en3
Yeah and Eddie is in form rn and might take that starting 9 spot,Arsenal,Yes,j6u2uy9,t1_j6u2h2s

Stronger?,Arsenal,Yes,j6u2ims,t1_j6u24qa
"What I took from that info is not the ""relationship is ruined"" part. Who the fuck cares. The part I took is ""Arsenal misjudged the situation"". For me that shows they made a bit of a mistake - it seemed pretty obvious to plenty of us (not exactly football ""experts"") that Brighton had no need to and wouldn't sell Caicedo. So I was very confused that we kept pursuing it. And we seem to have wasted a lot of the last few days on it.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r8cwi,t1_j6r7wpz
"They told us not to do something and we did it lol. They consider that disrespectful whether we/you agree or not.

"It's not his technique that's the problem it's his decision making. He'll get into good positions and then have the dumbest brain farts, he'll boot it up, lose the ball clumsily etc.",Arsenal,Yes,j6to88i,t1_j6tmj2v
"Watch the All or Nothing and watch the coaching staff gush over him and his metrics, which they called, ‚Äúoff the charts.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt buy him a season ago to flip him, and they didn‚Äôt loan him to increase his transfer value. I imagine his loan was a lot like Smith Rowe‚Äôs, where Arteta told him he wasn‚Äôt going to watch a single match, he only wanted to hear what his coaches and teammates had to say about his character/personality.

Like Smith Rowe, the talent is there, the question is the mental. Both lacked confidence, but in different ways; Arteta sent them on loan to determine if they could mentally cope with the dressing room and mental demands of the premier league.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tmte0,t1_j6tmj2v
"If you remember the Fulham game, KT was subbed off for Nketiah, Gabi dropped to WB, and they shifted to a 3-5-2. We haven‚Äôt seen it much this season, because we‚Äôve largely been ahead and Eddie is now starting, but it‚Äôs a formation Arteta turned to when trailing last season, and something that was heavily on display in the preseason. 

It‚Äôs a niche role, but a valuable one. I also imagine he could play on either flank, as he‚Äôs quite two footed, or as a late defensive sub at either wing, when the legs get tired. He just turned 23 last week, so there‚Äôs plenty of time and competitions for him to get minutes.",Arsenal,Yes,j6trerp,t1_j6tqnn4
We only found out Partey had pace last game tbf üòÇ,Arsenal,Yes,j6r7zg7,t1_j6r6rav

[deleted],Arsenal,Yes,j6svruj,t1_j6svp96
"Disagree, think he's been pretty poor since the wc. Poor first half against west ham, really poor against newcastle, poor against united. Delivered against Brighton alltough his overall play wasn't impressive. If it's his form or down to Jesus absence I'm not sure but I'd like to see Trossard given some starts for now. Martinelli did look good coming off the bench against City, so having him with his pace the last 30 minutes could be very good too. But I think some competition is good for him.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t83g4,t1_j6sxgif
"I *think* they were trying to say if spending ~80m on Caicedo blocked a summer move that would have been foolish.

I think.",Arsenal,Yes,j6skqj2,t1_j6skkyn
"Jorginho and Trossard obviously. 

We will have Partey and Jorginho for no. 6 position. It could be the difference between signing Rice and Caicedo, and signing one of them. Don‚Äôt think Jorginho would be expected to be 3rd choice no 6.

For this reason I think Caicedo ship has sailed now.  expect Liverpool or Chelsea to sign him.",Arsenal,Yes,j6srdfc,t1_j6skkyn
"> I mean, Mikel has never said that Partey's profile is his ideal preference for a 6 in his dream system.

Apart from signing him, and turning him into a 6 who is absolutely crucial to our setup and our success, and forcing him to play every second he can, to the point of actually shoving him onto the pitch when he was injured.

I am a big fan of words, but there are times actions speak louder than...

Jorginho will be firmly benched behind Thomas.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ru7ah,t1_j6rqeek

">He's is not really great at anything in particular so I don't see how he fits into a midtable potentially relegation threatened team where you need grafters and/or creative outlets.

nah this totally saves it.  Most accurate description of Sambi I've seen.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sgu36,t1_j6sg03j
Suddenly this makes so much sense lmfao,Arsenal,Yes,j6smbl4,t1_j6slwzt
"Yeah, the rotation will be stuff like when we play Villa 3 days after City.",Arsenal,Yes,j6slemk,t1_j6sjosh
"Jorginho has a lot of the qualities Partey doesn't and vise versa, but personally think that Jorginho's qualities are more suited the style Arteta is trying to get this team to play. I think Jorginho is going to surprise a lot of people with how well the team performs with him in the starting XI",Arsenal,Yes,j6sk5xe,t1_j6sjosh
Chelsea have dumb fans just like ours who say this is a stupid signing. He‚Äôs still a top player. I‚Äôm really excited to see him play in Arteta‚Äôs system. Arteta is the best manager he‚Äôs played under.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sl6pr,t1_j6skldf
Completly different team lol. He will be fired up for us fpr sure,Arsenal,Yes,j6sn8j2,t1_j6skldf
5'10? Jesus ain't no 5'10 surely. He got that small player body surely a tall 5'9,Arsenal,Yes,j6v6pxm,t1_j6uny4p
"Small is more than just height. Jesus is 161 pounds. Balo is 146. That might not sound like much but in boxing they'd be two weight classes apart, such is the advantage of 15 lbs. He's young so maybe he'll grow but right now he's small and whenever he's played for Arsenal, that's come across.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vogqf,t1_j6uny4p
I think if we sell him there‚Äôs no way we can afford him at full potential. He offers such unique striker movement mixed with False 9 skills. Give Arteta a player with his mentality and it‚Äôs going to be special,Arsenal,Yes,j6unhxk,t1_j6un15t

He is not the same player and it would be ridiculous for us to sign him.,Arsenal,Yes,j6ta927,t1_j6t9s7i
I would say his performances in the Bundesliga has not really been noteworthy at all. He has potential but i do think there are alot more players with high potential out there as a winger. But yes we could do alot worse.,Arsenal,Yes,j6taf8c,t1_j6t9s7i

"Right? I can understand if we wanted certain better players but damn we signed 3 players in January (2 of whom are PL proven and ready to hit the ground running) and boosted our title challenge. We are 5 points clear of City and the new players seem suited to our style of play.

Remember the meltdown when they signed Kai....,Arsenal,Yes,j6rhdez,t1_j6rfhhr
He was told after the opening bid lol. That's all the warning you need.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rc8wg,t1_j6rbnhy
"Caicedo is integral to Brighton, who are fighting for Europe for the first time in their history, under-21 and it‚Äôs in the last few days of the window, of course you‚Äôre going to have to drastically over pay especially with how the market is for these sorts of players. 

Brighton‚Äôs valuation will shoot up because of the situation that they‚Äôre in, that‚Äôs just how it is. 

They rejected 65m bid in 10 minutes and we came back with 70m like come on, after the first bid we should‚Äôve really tried to test them and bid 80/85+5 then if they reject that then you stop because it‚Äôs getting overboard.

Good deals are hard to find in January especially for hyped players obviously they shouldn‚Äôt just pay over the odds for every player but there is a time to negotiate and there is a time to pay.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rds0p,t1_j6rbws1
"There was a clause by Abramovich that the new owners would have to invest so many hundreds of millions in the first couple of years, fully expecting them to start seeing a return in their investment after that",Arsenal,Yes,j6s6kwp,t1_j6s3s3g
"Absolutely, but they have to go for top youth in order to spread it over such long contracts. It wouldn't work if they spent ¬£100m on 27 year olds over an 8 year contract",Arsenal,Yes,j6r4sev,t1_j6r4hef
Liverpool are further behind Chelsea in their ‚Äòrevamp‚Äô. Their owners really don‚Äôt want to spend,Arsenal,Yes,j6r5y80,t1_j6r42zy

"I know but still, 28 signings when for the prem you really only need 23 playable ones.",Arsenal,Yes,j6s4dhl,t1_j6s3fot
"Yeah but to be fair this is something we could have done last summer and definitely should have got done early this window. 

Elnenys injury really shouldn‚Äôt have been the trigger. We could definitely accommodate a midfield signing with a fit elneny.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r88qj,t1_j6r83m9
Doesn't mean we should've allowed the timeframe to get that short though,Arsenal,Yes,j6r89wy,t1_j6r83m9
Yup I like Wakanda Ball better.,Arsenal,Yes,j6uzuor,t1_j6uzaky
"By your logic if he didn't prove himself in the pl yet he should be more than enough for a 3rd choice striker.

"Transfer value varies greatly according to player situation. If next year we keep him in the squad and he's our third striker, his value will fall tremendously, even Flo will want to leave. I'm sure the club who see him m in training everyday would be best placed to make a decision. If next year he goes on another loan to a PL club and doesn't perform, his value will reduce. So you never know. Best to keep the person who's performing better in practice, training and sell the other one. Keeping 3 strikers is impossible",Arsenal,Yes,j6vxmph,t1_j6vxa4a

"Yeah, it was an even game overall although I thought it swung back in City's favour in the second half as we replaced Partey with Lokonga at HT.

Pep also acknowledged the changes after the game. He said at the Emirates with Zinchenko and Odegaard starting, it will be a completely different challenge.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rt4q7,t1_j6rsuya
Well he wouldve been a very good squad player.,Arsenal,Yes,j6vts8z,t1_j6vr7ml
"I‚Äôm pretty confident Balogun isn‚Äôt going to be the greatest striker in the history of the premier league. 

Successful loan spell or not. 

The chances that he will be is about 1 in a million. So yeah I feel pretty confident speaking in absolutes given those odds.

All your data says is that loan spells are not great predictors of future quality.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vvq6l,t1_j6vuw95

"I have never said any of that, all I'm saying is that literally anyone could do the job he's done here. Not to mention that he bid a lot of money for players too like Mudryk, Valhovic and Caicedo. They just don't get accepted.",Arsenal,Yes,j6riz3l,t1_j6riqv2
The Real Madrid player that literally no other team wanted who we paid just around the asked price for ? Who was also requested by Arteta ? And who Edu was looking to sign fucking Coutinho in his position ? That Odegaard ?,Arsenal,Yes,j6ridjh,t1_j6rhw7f
"What you want, incomings or outgoings ? Also, what year ? Literally every single team in the world has had transfer masterstrokes except us under Edu, I'll pull out lists for you",Arsenal,Yes,j6ri6as,t1_j6rhl2b
"Well yeah, because it's the media that's reporting negotiations. The football results are because of Arteta and his eye for talent and coaching ability. All our good players were signed because Arteta wanted them and no other team was in for them, and Arteta coached them well. Edu had wanted to sign shite players and couldn't sign other Arteta targets.",Arsenal,Yes,j6riiw5,t1_j6rhv7q
"To be clear, i am happy with the signings and he has been able to do shrewd business.  I am less happy that every big name we want to go after seems to fall apart so far.   His chance to prove us all wrong is the summer bc we need a world class CM not an up and coming player with a high ceiling",Arsenal,Yes,j6s03dh,t1_j6rzp16
"Yeah the people with doubts over him want to make it out like he's somehow the inexperienced one in this realm of executives and he's in over his head, when in fact he's had the most mature and levelheaded approach in a wildly inflated market, and it's only been paying dividends. 

The immaturity would be to succumb to the pressures of other clubs when he knows that's not what the players are worth. The thought of 'Don Raul' still stings to this day yet we still beg Edu to give in to what we already know ourselves to be ludicrous demands (I know I've been guilty). 

Even regardless of the final result this season, we'll probably be looking back at this period in awe at how he's helped raise the levels from where we were to where we got with such an austere policy.

E: Ramsdale an overspend? Hell, Chelshit needed 120m to find one half of a decent goalkeeper. White 50m? Topspurs on their third 35m rightback. Edu's been one and done, wouldn't say he's overspent once. Knows value for money like these clubs wish",Arsenal,Yes,j6s3rvc,t1_j6s0we6
"OK lets relax.  I am well aware he is not operating in a silo, but as a TD recruitment and negotiating is part of his actual job no?  And IMO, this is more than just ""give me a number for approval"", there are obviously tactics involved in how conversations are had, etc.  I am also aware not all of it is in his control (Vlah wanted Juve, Chelsea overspent, etc) but then I see Liverpool get Gakpo done with no noise or drama and it makes you wonder why all of our transfers are drawn out soap operas that we cant get done.",Arsenal,Yes,j6s1n7j,t1_j6s0sxc
"Let‚Äôs be realistic here, there‚Äôs still massive holes in the squad and we‚Äôre overachieving based upon how we all thought we would be.

It‚Äôs brilliant that we‚Äôre fighting for titles, and long may it continue, but we don‚Äôt have a squad (16-19 players) that you would expect to be fighting for titles",Arsenal,Yes,j6rdwsq,t1_j6rd31e
"I agree, however if we were quicker we could've close the deal before Chelsea offered an 8 year contract with crazy wages.

We had an agreement with the player very early on, we were just taking the piss in our negotiations with Shaktar.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rlnti,t1_j6rlel1
I'm a free registration user and I can watch it? If you are talking about the interview?,Arsenal,Yes,j6taoba,t1_j6syv55
Youll move on too. I was annoyed by that too.,Arsenal,Yes,j6t10wz,t1_j6svz2z
Neither. Money has influence over UEFA.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r5msj,t1_j6r5kfb

"Mudryk was not stupid. All their wingers are shit, that's why they signed Mudryk and Madueke.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rkhie,t1_j6rk03g
They think Silva would save them,Arsenal,Yes,j6rkr8a,t1_j6rk7ul
We signed Badiashile K2 hasn‚Äôt seen the pitch since and we also haven‚Äôt given up a goal since. Reece and Chilwell are back as well now. Defensively we are set attack we‚Äôll see what Mudryk Madueke and Felix can do still questions in the midfield but Enzo is a profile we were desperate for. A lot of what you lot are saying is cope about whether the team will gel or not these signing weren‚Äôt only for this year alone,Arsenal,Yes,j6rtz46,t1_j6rk7ul
"The wage bill has to get restructured sometime, right? I don‚Äôt think it happens with Jude; it wouldn‚Äôt be a great look to have everyone extend - with nobody earning over ¬£250k/week, only to turn around and make Jude the highest earner. Conversely, signing him before the key extensions would lead to a windfall for any player yet to extend. 

If/when there is a change in the wage bill, I imagine √òdegaard will get the first contract over ¬£300k/week, followed by an incoming player.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tdm1e,t1_j6tcj1n
Reality has no place in my telephonic fantasy.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tdn0f,t1_j6tcj1n
"Well if Villa had paid 200m we would‚Äôve sold him so yes he is for sale at the right price, the issue was they were messing around with 25m bifs",Arsenal,Yes,j6rcpk0,t1_j6raj5x
"Size of the club does matter though, Caicedo wanted the move and ESR didn‚Äôt.

Villa also offered 30m and we offered 70",Arsenal,Yes,j6r8ekt,t1_j6r7rc9
"1) ESR was an important player at that time, preferred to Martinelli
2) Villa offered us 30m and we offered Brighton 70",Arsenal,Yes,j6r89sn,t1_j6r7sh1
"It's strange because personally I took a boat load of abuse for not calling for Arteta's head as vocally as some others (lovely threatening DMs from some people who used to be in here).

I couldn't give a shit about being proved right or whatever and I'm more than happy to be proved wrong about things, but far too many things are treated as black and white when several things can be equally right/wrong at exactly the same time",Arsenal,Yes,j6r5fm1,t1_j6r4za9
"30 percent of which was add-ons, nobody accepting that for top midfielder talent",Arsenal,Yes,j6s8fkb,t1_j6s83nw
Elaborate,Arsenal,Yes,j6rgrhr,t1_j6rgi7e
"Yes. And their fans are creaming every time a deal is announced.  
  
Later they complain their signing didn‚Äôt live to their expectation.  
Since 2015/16 those are the bigger names they‚Äôve signed:  
Sterling, Felix, Lukaku, Kovacic, T Silva, D Luiz, Falcao.  
  
These are all A class players but only T Silva and Lukaku are S class players.  
So the list is packed with B class a lower players.  
  
Loads of risky signings for crazy money.",Arsenal,Yes,j6s9ib2,t1_j6s5vph
"Hmmm that's possible, I mean Boehly would be stupid if he expects short term success even if the spending is like that lmao",Arsenal,Yes,j6rcdb3,t1_j6rc7j5
So what I'm hearing is with CL football next year Maddison is coming on a free so we get 100millon of players for 30mill and kept Xhaka happy all at the same time.,Arsenal,Yes,j6siz8j,t1_j6shcyz
Maddison would be guaranteed a spot here.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sdwi1,t1_j6sa8ja
As opposed to stay at Leicester last summer....,Arsenal,Yes,j6sfdum,t1_j6sa8ja
We have the extra ¬£35mill though....,Arsenal,Yes,j6satv5,t1_j6sa8jg
IIRC Gnabry's father said that he's signing with Bayern before his transfer to Bundesliga happened so we knew (or at least suspected) from the start.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w0fot,t1_j6vz0p1
"I feel like if i was German, I'd really hate Bayern. Also then i was just watch matches and read newspaper kinda guy so I didn't realise the tampering. Bayern mostly do their poaching in league. But i really really hate Barcelona and their players' antics with Fabregas...it was so infuriating. I hope that club gets dissolved, obviously it won't happen because that's one of the only two beams holding la liga upright",Arsenal,Yes,j6vyrof,t1_j6vxom9
He deserves credit for spending 600m in a year and then fighting for the title? Are you serious or joking?,Arsenal,Yes,j6sn1hg,t1_j6sjtzr
"There's nothing redundant about spending money to replace underperformance and Chelsea can continuously do that until success is achieved. We just don't want that to happen during our cycle of being a top team.

The difference between then and now is, despite Potter's awful start, the squad he inherited wasn't great to begin with and his style is infinitely more progressive than the last 5 coaches they have had. The squad they are amassing now for a progressive manager to work with is scary.

Of course football isn't linear so there's no guarantee that what they are doing is going to be a success but from a purely speculative standpoint they are building something substantial.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sn1a3,t1_j6sm40n
"you people exaggerate the amount of ""rotation"" so much

no team plays 3 CF (or 3 of any position). not even man city.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w3ztb,t1_j6ver3i
Boehly is not independently wealthy and running the club like a hobby like an oil club. The buy contract had a stipulation to invest $1B to make the club more competitive. Eventually he will have to be profitable. Either you run the club as a hobby or a business. If you're run like a business you have finite resources regardless of owner resources.,Arsenal,Yes,j6vob7b,t1_j6vnpus
Liverpool‚Äôs top target will be Bellingham (assuming they have motivated ownership in the summer).,Arsenal,Yes,j6rkfv2,t1_j6rjr7d
"Any club you know in the world with three strikers?

We literally just let Cedric leave because you can't gamble on the prospect of 2 players getting injured for you to play.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tg1ga,t1_j6t9cqo
"We play a formation with one striker. There is zero reason to have 3 strikers in the squad. 

Might as well have 3 players in each position in case of injury, because that's how football clubs operate in your mind.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t9u1k,t1_j6t9cqo
"With that logic we should have 33 quality players in the squad, 3 at each position.

If and when someone is injured/suspended, we resolve that issue internally like playing Martinelli/Trossard at 9.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ta7s6,t1_j6t9cqo
"I've thought about it, we can carry Eddie, Jesus and Balogun, but someone gonna have to do some shifts on the wings lol. I'd like to keep him, we'll see.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ukbob,t1_j6tbplf
True. But neither is Balogun,Arsenal,Yes,j6tbh6p,t1_j6ta69x
Boo,Arsenal,Yes,j6te98c,t1_j6ta69x
what we need from jorg that we can't find in sambi is positioning to play from the back and jorginho is rated for his maturity in that regard so we can still play from the back even without partey compared to how sambi just hiding behind attacking player.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r4glv,t1_j6r45xc
We wheat to invest more,Arsenal,Yes,j6r4f50,t1_j6r478h
"He said Arteta tried to get him ""a few times"". Maybe he means a few times in the one summer, but I'd have thought he meant more than one window.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r63gd,t1_j6r5oo8
I'll enjoy the Spurs downfall as well.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rq2s9,t1_j6rq058
"It's been so nice to see 'dae √òdegaard can't shoot' die so swift a death, along with 'dae Thomas is really an 8' and 'dae Martinelli is our weak link'; 'dae worry about ESR/ESR should be sold/isn't an Arteta player' soon to follow. Always stupid takes, bludgeoned like seal pups.",Arsenal,Yes,j6so7no,t1_j6snng9
"It‚Äôs widely been reported he refused to Answer calls from Arsenal/Edu, after the club reached an agreement with Fiorentina. 

Since then, Edu/recruitment has engaged with the player‚Äôs side before approaching the club.",Arsenal,Yes,j6skarr,t1_j6sixk9
"We have 3 LW.

We have 1 RW",Arsenal,Yes,j6tv91p,t1_j6tuxc4
"His name is Starboy, the hell you mean",Arsenal,Yes,j6tv3c0,t1_j6tuxc4
"I do. I always didn't care about Spurs that much (dislike Chelsea and United more) . 

But now that the club is good enough to challenge for the PL again, I realised I never cared about them anyway.

I'm not local to north london I'm not gonna force myself to care and obsess about them like people here.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ue99w,t1_j6udobj
I doubt our club actually WANTS to sell Tierney. Only reason there are rumours is because he is the one who is considering a new club,Arsenal,Yes,j6vrfw9,t1_j6vrcub
There's almost no way we get Jude. Look at who's in for him and the money they'll offer.,Arsenal,Yes,j6vis89,t1_j6vip62
would rather keep balogun,Arsenal,Yes,j6vm1wr,t1_j6vip62
sure both things can be true. you believing what you said and edu not being able to sell well,Arsenal,Yes,j6tfkxz,t1_j6tfamw
this is an awful take lmao. which players did we have to sell under Edu that were worth anything?,Arsenal,Yes,j6tg4qv,t1_j6tfamw
"Well, it's going to be interesting to see how that actually goes together.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rwx8e,t1_j6ruphj
no I don't.  where would they get the money to do that from? No more spreading the cost over 8 years for FFP in from this coming summer so that means there's no way they can do this again.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rlive,t1_j6rl83g
"A lot of money and he will walk into a favourable job straight away again. 

I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs not unhappy.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rkjtl,t1_j6rk8eh
"You can buy all the individual talent you want but at the end of the day it‚Äôs a team sport. 

I see no evidence of a team here - I‚Äôll worry about it when we start to see signs of it. For now they‚Äôre a mess with big pockets.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rkv7n,t1_j6rkkg8
"I suppose the difference this time is that (in principle, at least) it will be difficult to replace these players given the wages and length of contract.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rkrw1,t1_j6rkkg8
Sure but that money wasted over the summer leading them to mid table. Who‚Äôs to say it won‚Äôt happen again? There are many other teams playing better football in a clearer system. Chelsea are a mess.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rl2lc,t1_j6rkqcn
"It's not ruined, they're just having a whinge. There'll be more deals on the future. We hardly did anything other than bid 1 more time. They'll get over it. We can just as easily point to the good working relationship to get White and Trossard as evidence of working cordially.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r7kbp,t1_j6r713b
"Oh no, we bid twice for a player.

What a horrible thing we've done.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r75py,t1_j6r65mz
"And I respect that but I do not get the constant complaining about honestly very minuscule things considering how massively we are over performing expectations this season, I was a child the last time arsenal were anywhere near this good",Arsenal,Yes,j6r7dh0,t1_j6r6z2j
Did betis a favour tho,Arsenal,Yes,j6uadav,t1_j6u75y1
Competition is good; nobody should be guaranteed a spot in the Starting XI,Arsenal,Yes,j6u364x,t1_j6u2uy9
"Maybe but I feel Jesus makes the team even better with his passing and pressing. It'll be interesting to see what Arteta does, at the very least Eddie will get even more minutes I'm sure.",Arsenal,Yes,j6u9uys,t1_j6u2uy9
The literal police are everywhere,Arsenal,Yes,j6u9p03,t1_j6u63my

"I feel like there's bots here, lol 

No way of telling, maybe, but any time anything big happens, the subs flooded with people with some of the most toxic awful takes. 

Maybe just fans of rival clubs being trolls. Maybe we're just gargantuan.",Arsenal,Yes,j6svntf,t1_j6sulrk
"There are more bots now then when be took over.

The only thing Elon was right about was that he definitely needed a hair transplant.",Arsenal,Yes,j6suwfw,t1_j6sulrk
"There were tons of people melting down about edu on the night when jorginho was announced as our likely target. Biggest meltdown that was since we lost to Newcastle last season.

"Just the finishing touch on the portrait, there.

The pretence that no-one watches non-Arsenal PL matches or the WC was the balance.

"Aaaaand, you just self reported.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t5u4n,t1_j6svsqg
"I think they needed a cheap back up to Tierney. He cost 7m and we could get 20m back for him. He doesn't have a future. Too careless in possession. Can't rely on him to retain the ball. Maybe in five years he'd be a good option, but what's the point?",Arsenal,Yes,j6tofd7,t1_j6tmte0

"Maybe, but it still doesn‚Äôt make sense. 

Why would buying Caicedo in January be ‚Äúshear stupidity‚Äù if it meant Rice doesn‚Äôt come in the summer? The business was just drawn forward, and one top CM was brought in over another (6 months early). 

I guess they could be a huge Rice fanboy, but even if Jorginho blocked Rice, it would be a brilliant signing, should Arsenal go on to win the league. 

I would trade a 10 year transfer ban for a title.",Arsenal,Yes,j6smsrx,t1_j6skqj2
No. I am taking about Jorginho. We will be investing 18m in Jorginho next season. It could be a significant deterrent,Arsenal,Yes,j6ss2lj,t1_j6skqj2
"> Don‚Äôt think Jorginho would be expected to be 3rd choice no 6.

Happily, signed at a budget price and with only a year left on his deal come summer, we won't need to give a fuck what Jorginho thinks about our future signings.

Balogun is no winger, his talent would be wasted out wide.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tzs2b,t1_j6tz9m1
Jorginho is more suited tactically to start against city and Partey to play against Villa though. Don‚Äôt think Arteta will be bold enough to make a call like that without seeing more of Jorginho in the team first.

"There is a huge range of more and less reasonable opinion between their 'Jorginho is a stupid signing' -- which he isn't, really, given the state of our squad -- and your 'Jorginho is a better fit and will displace Thomas', which is equally idiotic.",Arsenal,Yes,j6slwvw,t1_j6sl6pr

"Yea, and we did try and overpay. To the tune of 70 million pounds. That's already a drastic overpay. 

Ultimately, whatever way this shook out, people will look to fund fault with Edu. If he offered 85M and they still rejected it, people would still be criticising him for upsetting Brighton.",Arsenal,Yes,j6re9o2,t1_j6rds0p
The only issue they have is their midfield. They clearly need midfield revamp signing 2 or 3 and they are already set. And also they have one of the best managers in the world which Chelsea don not have atleast for now.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r67fd,t1_j6r5y80

"This is all just shades of 'why would saliba come back, why would he want another loan, he's ging to leave because we didn't give him a chance, arteta doesn't trust young players....

They just absolutely suck at getting a team to work together. They can spend all they want but the area of the pitch where they have the most talent is the attacking department (underperforming talent) and they‚Äôre actually weak in other areas - so what did they do?

over who? (in the first XI),Arsenal,Yes,j6sflgx,t1_j6sdwi1
"We all knew but we had no actual proof and lets be honest UEFA and especially the Bundesliga aren't going to slap Bayern down.

Despise that club probably more than anyone except Spurs, Chelsea, Man U and Barca.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w0pzc,t1_j6w0fot
Honestly think the Germans have just internalised the whole Bayern thing and just decided that the real prize is being 'fan owned' while just ignoring the utter corruption that is Bayern or just waving away criticism because they've got cheap tickets.,Arsenal,Yes,j6w04xw,t1_j6vyrof
"Being competitive with United, City, Liverpool and Arsenal isn't easy and requires near perfection. Spending helps obviously, but this isn't FM or FIFA. It guarantees nothing.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sng6b,t1_j6sn1hg
"Not every player will be good in the first 3-6 months of a move. Some of our greatest ever players took time to adapt.

Same for many other stars in the league now, like Rodri and Partey.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sn8ud,t1_j6sn1a3
"We've got three DM's and bought an extra one.

Cedric is our third choice RB and he's already had game timeWhile Saka, Marquinhos and Nelson have all played RW so far this season.

Yeah tha'ts because of injuries but injuries are a fact of life and more importantly for when Nelson does leave, Eddie, Jesus and Balogun can play out wide.",Arsenal,Yes,j6w4hth,t1_j6w3ztb
"Yeah ik, that‚Äôs why Chelski fans need to realize this kind of hotshot spending is probably not going to be the norm going forward next 2 seasons. Could be wrong but doubt it. They could continue this expenditure method if they keep getting CL and winning PLs and other trophies, success breeds profitability. That‚Äôs why I think the Kroenkes finally realized that and are now the type of owners we wanted ‚Äî ones that actually care and invest to win so success will bring profitable ROI. State owned clubs are another issue and disgrace imo.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vox88,t1_j6vob7b
"Top my head Napoli and Milan since I watch Serie A as well. The top 6 in prem probably don‚Äôt. Regardless this is my opinion and don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs a big deal. Like you said yourself, Cedric older and end of his career so doesn‚Äôt make sense to have him sitting around for him and the club.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tiifc,t1_j6tg1ga
Yeah because no other football team in the world has 3 strikers and the golden rule has to be 2. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if fans like you would be the first to slag Edu and Arteta why we let Balogun go and not relaxed him if we are ever down with both Eddie and Jesus.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tb25j,t1_j6t9u1k
Yeah okay mate that‚Äôs exactly what I said‚Ä¶,Arsenal,Yes,j6tajsb,t1_j6ta7s6
words need to have meaning,Arsenal,Yes,j6tflta,t1_j6te98c
"I was quite shocked by some of what was said about Martinelli. He had all the ingredients of a generational talent prior to injuries, and has been looking like an utter nightmare to play against all season *despite* those injuries.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ss0dc,t1_j6so7no
"I was happy Willock has been good and had that hot run of scoring 10 in 12 or whatever it was.

But Willock scored on something like ~65% of his shots. It was a rate well higher than Haaland.

Some of our fans were somehow convinced this was sustainable.",Arsenal,Yes,j6sok9p,t1_j6so7no
you make space for that level of talent. i mean seriously yeah we need a right winger,Arsenal,Yes,j6tvi8q,t1_j6tv91p
its okay to have more than one you know,Arsenal,Yes,j6tvrb6,t1_j6tv3c0
"We might have that money if we sell Balogun

Idk what the wage implications would be but around 150 m in dry powder + sales gives us a lot of cash to splash in the summer",Arsenal,Yes,j6viwxp,t1_j6vis89
You‚Äôre crazy lol,Arsenal,Yes,j6vnlfw,t1_j6vm1wr
Please show me evidence of Edu being good at selling,Arsenal,Yes,j6tfwjn,t1_j6tfkxz
"Liverpool and Chelsea regularly sell garbage for good money.

Wilock had like 8 goals and he only got 20m. Brewster haven't scored a PL goal in his life and he was sold for 30+ 

Gibbs-White barely played in the PL and was sold for 40m.

Actual good DOF can sell English talent well.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tgwxn,t1_j6tg4qv
"They can offload many players within the summer to increase their spending power. They have many ""star"" players like Sterling, Havertz, etc who need to go and can definitely bring in money. 

There is a rumour flying around this is why the reason why they submitted the ""wrong"" papers for Ziyech.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rlr1u,t1_j6rlive
"Chelsea has never been established as a team in that sense tho, no one actually plays for the badge at Chelsea but they still attain all the honours.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rlefc,t1_j6rkv7n
Missing out on Felix Mudryk and Caicedo is not miniscule. Especially when we all left summer knowing we needed a winger and midfielder. And knowing that the January market is a shit market for buyers. And knowing it would be compounded by WC inflation,Arsenal,Yes,j6r7kde,t1_j6r7dh0
Thank you. People on this sub have been so used to such a thin squad that they forgot what competition is,Arsenal,Yes,j6u3r48,t1_j6u364x
"More of a sideways move tbh. I might hate United and therefore all of their players but I don‚Äôt wish mental health issues on anyone, glad he recovered",Arsenal,Yes,j6u3wnt,t1_j6u2qdy
"They wouldn‚Äôt accept any permanent move for less than ¬£35m last summer, why would they sell for ¬£27m after this loan!? He also kept Tierney on the bench for multiple games last season, and was a instrumental in quite a few results last season. 

A Tierney transfer in the summer seems all but inevitable, and Nuno brings something to this squad that it currently lacks.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tp4hf,t1_j6tofd7
You‚Äôre saying gunnerblogs objective is to wind people up? LOL,Arsenal,Yes,j6r6dw4,t1_j6r5tfw
"Oh. That's silly and obviously not correct.

You can put Jesus on the wings and let Balogun be the backup 9,Arsenal,Yes,j6tzyx0,t1_j6tzs2b

[deleted],Arsenal,Yes,j6t8ktk,t1_j6t5qob
Nah he isn't good on the left.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tinsl,t1_j6thtkq
No he's not.  Maybe vs a washed Auba but compared to our current left side options he's not a palatable back up.  He doesn't play like a wide player.,Arsenal,Yes,j6tiaqm,t1_j6thtkq
"Their whole squad is aging. They‚Äôre declining and have no obvious successors. A midfield would help but that‚Äôs patching over the cracks. They need a proper overhaul. I have more faith in Klopp than Potter but the way things are going, Chelsea will eventually overtake Liverpool.",Arsenal,Yes,j6r8ubx,t1_j6r67fd
Been chasing a midfielder for a minimum of 3 windows,Arsenal,Yes,j6r90xv,t1_j6r8dni
Yes but the Caicedo nonsense was our fault. We were told in no uncertain terms he wasn't going anywhere with 3/4 days of the window left. We gambled that they were bluffing. We gambled wrong.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r8jqi,t1_j6r8dni
Forget the window of time we had. Clearly Jorginho was the backup plan long before we moved for Caicedo. Arteta has like the player for time. Things moved very quickly once the Caicedo deal fell through so it‚Äôs very unlikely that we hadn‚Äôt already planned to move for him once we couldn‚Äôt get our first choice.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rbvph,t1_j6r8dni
"No it does not

He signed that contract two years ago btw. A little bit has changed",Arsenal,Yes,j6uyz8u,t1_j6uy0az
"At the end of the day, it's the best kind of problem to have. And if it was Me, I'd use one of them to swap for a player in position of need. Like say, Rice for striker plus 10-20. But we need Rice next year, and i don't think anyone of us is ready to let either of Balogun and Nketiah so soon",Arsenal,Yes,j6vyaqc,t1_j6vxs8o
Im not upset with us selling him nor with us not buying him back. We couldve bought him before Milan bought him because we have a buyback clause.,Arsenal,Yes,j6vuiia,t1_j6vu64g
Lol fucking idiot,Arsenal,Yes,j6w3map,t1_j6w2uja
Well I still remember 19 Europa Final.,Arsenal,Yes,j6rbob9,t1_j6r5fee
"I can't believe anyone's watching anything Chelsea has done with anything other than disdain. That Enzo deal in and of itself is worthy of a deep dive just to see what actually happened. Actual total fee paid allegedly in the region of 200M. 

Once you peel back the sheen of shiny shiny new players, it's a particularly grim reality. There a house of cards in a room of fans at the minute.",Arsenal,Yes,j6t3440,t1_j6t1z4n
Oh oh.... Ziyech...of course. Funny af. I thought something happened to Omari and my comment was insensitive. Ziyech deal was fucking hilarious. That's what you get for going to Chelsea i suppose,Arsenal,Yes,j6w1fxc,t1_j6w0kll
Dennis Zakaria on a one year loan on deadline day and Palhinha for 15m,Arsenal,Yes,j6rj5pu,t1_j6ric3e
"Living in the past‚Ä¶ of 4 months ago? 

Also, it‚Äôs absolutely mental to look at our full squad and think that squad is fully capable of challenging for  titles year in, year out. If I‚Äôm living in the past, you‚Äôre living in dreamland expecting players to never dip out of form or pick up injuries.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rewnw,t1_j6red94
"Understood, my bad!",Arsenal,Yes,j6tdlcg,t1_j6tc4nq
"Yeah, which is why this stuff can still continue",Arsenal,Yes,j6r5uj1,t1_j6r5o1e
UEFA isn‚Äôt going to be under any meaningful pressure. This has been happening a long time and club opinions don‚Äôt dictate what UEFA does - money does.,Arsenal,Yes,j6r5vtr,t1_j6r5o1e
I came so see what you all thought of the Jorginho signing and stumbled across some hilariously poor takes,Arsenal,Yes,j6s8xwa,t1_j6s8go8
"That is the dream, but I‚Äôd get another attacker instead of Rice, and maybe the club can afford FDJ in two years.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tekv4,t1_j6te7ir
Well we‚Äôll never know,Arsenal,Yes,j6r8n7y,t1_j6r8hl2
Not if Real coming in with better package offer like Chelsea did with Mudryk,Arsenal,Yes,j6sjkqp,t1_j6sfk31
I'll give you a hint: not √òdegaard.,Arsenal,Yes,j6sftz2,t1_j6sflgx
"Right but, again, people's concerns aren't about this season.",Arsenal,Yes,j6snwyt,t1_j6sn8ud
"look the players you are mentioning. *Cedric*, who got a total of what? 90 minutes in 6 months? lol. complete non factor in the season. also he's gone

Marquinhos? 180 minutes or so? also gone

Nelson? even less i think?

three DMs? Lokonga is gone and Elneny prob out of the season too

all in all you've mentioned either youngster or older squad players. you simply do not maintain multiple top players of the same position, no team does, unless you got great youngsters coming",Arsenal,Yes,j6w81p9,t1_j6w4hth
"I don't think so.

Napoli's strikers are Osimhen and Simeone. Milan's strikers are Giroud and Origi. You can't count Zlatan. He was their second striker but he hasn't been playing since MAY. They had to sign Origi in the summer to fill the depth role. 

Clubs ONLY have 3 strikers in case of bad long term injuries. And as soon as that injury clears, they default back to 2. Case in point was Newcastle. They had Wilson, Isak and Wood. They'd have sold Wood but Wilson was injured and so was Isak. As soon as the other two were back, Newcastle gave up Wood to Forest.

About your Cedric point, it's even worse for a younger talent in need of minutes. That's why we let Lokonga go. Developing players need minutes. Balogun as third option would mean he only plays when Jesus and Eddie are out. That's just wrong for his development. Eddie was already starved for minutes. Now imagine the third option.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tm3vt,t1_j6tiifc
"you are incredibly thick.

Teams who play with 2 strikers formation, have 3 or more. Nobody else.

There is 0 chance of what you are saying to happen. I rather they cash in for him now, and put a buy back clause. You can't have 3 players for each position, it's impossible.",Arsenal,Yes,j6td3b7,t1_j6tb25j
"That‚Äôs why we get versatile players too though, Martinelli could potentially play there + who knows about ESR and Trossard as a false 9 if we‚Äôre in a pinch. 

We‚Äôre good at striker for now imo",Arsenal,Yes,j6tbw1u,t1_j6tajsb
"I can understand excitement, but football is always a longitudinal study. A bit like when I used to watch Quincy Owusu-Abeyie terrorise full backs in the league cup... about 3 times before he fell off like Dre after The Chronic (with no bounceback hit). Yet I thought at the time that he was going to rival CR7.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ssdxm,t1_j6sok9p

He‚Äôs going to get 400k at Madrid, United or City. 

We aren‚Äôt going near that",Arsenal,Yes,j6vu3tj,t1_j6viwxp
"Jude will be at least 150m. Young, English and possibly the most in demand U21 midfielder in all of Europe.",Arsenal,Yes,j6vj2kq,t1_j6viwxp
25 mil for willock,Arsenal,Yes,j6tgf59,t1_j6tfwjn
"How would keeping Ziyech at the club help?  His value is more likely to go up at PSG than staying at Chelsea.

Well we had about ¬£150mill on paper of dead wood yet got about ¬£50mill in total for them so perhaps they raise some money but I image they already need at least 50% of it to cover the players they have already bought.",Arsenal,Yes,j6rlzzk,t1_j6rlr1u
"It is minuscule, our first XI is the best XI in the league. Paying outrageous sums for players who won‚Äôt start most likely is just wild, and the deals were all incredibly complex because like you said January is terrible.


I would‚Äôve loved a winger in the summer but for whatever reason it wasn‚Äôt feasible or they learned during the season the position was a higher priory than they thought and they adapted- which is just objectively smart like",Arsenal,Yes,j6r7swz,t1_j6r7kde
"I see what you're getting at, but you won't find much luck bridging that gap for people on here. It's certainly possible, but what Tierney offers in defensive solidity is yet to be matched by Nuno. 

I'd feel more comfortable with Tierney as option 2 behind Zinchenko. But Nuno's ceiling is significantly higher and I do love an agent of chaos.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tpvwm,t1_j6tp4hf
"Can't argue with the last part. I don't particularly rate Tierney either though, so Nuno benching him is no great feat. He does offer something different though I suppose. We'll see. He's definitely better in offensive areas than Tierney.",Arsenal,Yes,j6tpsgf,t1_j6tp4hf

Bruv edu convinced balogun to stay in the first place when he had 6 months left on the contract. If you genuinely think he could only sell him for 16m when he's playing this good then you might just be one of the most deluded sods I've seen on this subreddit,Arsenal,Yes,j6tkk7i,t1_j6tjjym

"So basically a player would move clubs once 51% ownership is reached?

but to do that in the scenario the player and agent has to forfeit, albeit they are paid for their shares, and then they end up owned by two clubs.

Seems a colossal waste of time.  And why would Brighton sell part of their shares to get stuck with part of a player they don't want.  Their shares devalue because they have to sell them otherwise they cant reinvest in their squad.",Arsenal,Yes,j6ta1za,t1_j6t8ktk
"How does that even work? if Arsenal buys Caicedo's %, what will he have at Arsenal?

700mill of players over 8 years is still hitting the FFP allowance by 90mill a year.  Then they have all the existing pre Boehly players that were still being split over their contracts, and then they'd add any new ones.

I'd also say Kante could be good, because he covers play well but can also roam forward (and then Enzo could cover). When we need to break teams down having two AMs ready to prowl forward could make the difference.",Chelsea,Yes,j7add71,t1_j7abqs3

They are not wrong. He's more of a 8 who proclivity in the LHS. 

>Assuming we want to try him out at 8 who do we pair him up in midfield with? 

Someone of a destroyer playing style. A young Casemiro/Fernandinho/Fabinho kind. I dunno if there is someone of that calibre left in Brazil or South America. There are also some fine Africa originated players (Soumare, Onana, Kone). I think we should be trying Trevor in that role till Kante returns and we get someone like Rice in the summer. Sorry I completely forgot Zakaria. Probably due to his injury history. 

>Does it look like a Matic-Fabregas pair

Sort of. 

>Think we should curb spending in the next window and make sure the potter project is on track before taking next steps?

I believe the project is on the right track so far (55%). 15% for the 3 positions we need to strengthen (DM, AM, CF) and 30% for the clear out - which is the main issue, because I can think of a XI who should go on loaned or be sold.",Chelsea,Yes,j7afeko,t1_j7abqs3

"The very very first trait you must have as a central mid is that you have to chase the ball in possession. You should be looking to get on the ball, look after the ball, move the ball around well.

"Honestly think if Havertz gets any offers this summer, it's likely Real Madrid is one of them. They could really do with a Benzema alternative, and Havertz is kind of similar minus the goals. Also maybe they see him as a viable RW option, a two birds with one stone kinda deal. 

Maybe this is all just hopium, though.",Chelsea,Yes,j7c7atd,t1_j7ba6gt
"It's funny how we've sort of accepted that being 9/10 is part of the process, also we've had  a similar injury crisis and finished 4th last season. But winning 3/4 games out of 20 is all part of a plan and not the manager being shit.",Chelsea,Yes,j7a9cj6,t1_j7a76ub

Our issues are in the midfield third and ball progression. While our wingers aren't necessarily Hazard 1 Vs 1 players like Sterling have been very good over the years stretching the pitch and beating fullbacks by being isolated 1 Vs 1 so the problem is further back imo.

I‚Äôd say defensive midfield is now a must and a striker if we can get a world class target. Don‚Äôt underestimate how crucial the signing of Enzo could be",Chelsea,Yes,j7c0oin,t1_j7bwucq

"Lol cannot believe you are asking this question.

Enzo is a deep lying creative midfielder, like Fabregas was for us. We're just playing him in the Jorginho role because we don't have a holding midfielder to play alongside him and do you want to be using Gallagher as a 6 üíÄüíÄüíÄ",Chelsea,Yes,j7cjl3x,t1_j7bwucq

"Firstly, it's going to take time for eight new signings to settle into the team as well as form an encouraging gameplan with all of the injured players who have missed time over the past months.

Secondly, you're overestimating the readiness of these players. They're all exciting, don't get me wrong, but the point for most of them is development. Fofana made his name in the Eliteserien and lower European competitions, Madueke can barely complete 90' minutes and is still a raw profile to work with. Even Mudryk hasn't got much experience to his name, and Enzo looks fantastic but less than a year ago he would've been perceived totally diffferently. 

Hopefully Potter can get a tune going by the end of the season, and give us something to build on next season once we add a few more players.",Chelsea,Yes,j7d6lc3,t1_j7d2lgv

Makes no sense at all. Conte took us from 10th to title winners in 1 season. Tuchel took the players struggling at 9th under Lampard to Champions league winner in the same season.

"There's a reason why, despite having the most talented squad we've had in years, England still can't be ball dominant against elite opposition. A midfield three of Rice, Mount, and Gallagher would basically be tacitly accepting we don't want the ball and we just want to sit deep and absorb pressure. Yet these are the players a lot of fans want populating our middle third.

Mount was at his best in the 343, left inside forward position. He was adept at receiving under pressure, back to goal, and linking up with others on the half-turn. It's a pretty niche skillset to be honest (Ziyech, for example, fucking sucks at it). The onus on those inside forwards to be creative is offset by the fact that they are also meant to enable the wingbacks to overload the widths of the pitch. They're primarily meant to receive the ball, drag players away from the wingbacks so that the wingbacks are always the spare man out wide. But outside of that role, he's not comfortable enough linking up play earlier in phases of possession, nor does he have a reliable final ball required for facing the play in the final third of the pitch. He's a solid all-rounder who excels in a very specific position.

He cannot bear a majority of our team's creative duties. It's a poor use of his skillset. Given these facts, I don't see the rationale for giving him a contract comparable to James, who on most metrics is an anomaly.",Chelsea,Yes,j7awon8,t1_j7avf03

Gallagher played further up the pitch as a 10 most of the time for Palace. Mount plays as our ‚Äú10‚Äù but they‚Äôre both awful in transition. Both are too slow and make too many i necessary touches. Which is funny because amount‚Äôs career highlight will be that through ball to Havertz for the CL goal. Probably the last time he‚Äôs played such a pass,Chelsea,Yes,j7bc5q7,t1_j7barcg

"I'm just looking at stats at transfermarkt, and looking among players with most appereances in each season since 19/20 (Mount's senior debut at Chelsea) it looks as follows.

Mount - 227 appereances

Bruno Fernandes - 226 appereances

Bernardo Silva - 218 appereances

Rodri - 215 appereances

Raheem Sterling - 205 appereances

Mo Salah - 201 appereances

Harry Maguire - 198 appereances

Declan Rice - 191 appereances

Phil Phoden - 189 appereances

Aside from Sterling (who mostly played for City during that time) no Chelsea did cross 200 games in that period of time.

Kai Havertz has 195, Jorginho 192, Azpi 185 appereances, Thiago Silva has 174 appereances (which is impressive in it's own way, given his age). 

So yeah, Mount is by far the most exploited players in our club, and one of the most if not most exploited in general. 

DISCLAIMER: I was not looking at goalkeepers and also didn't look at other leagues, given there are less opportunities to play games for them, e.g. there's only one domestic cup in other countries, Bundesliga plays only 34 games a season etc.",Chelsea,Yes,j7ckncx,t1_j7cejhn
"Ahh,

Yeah I have mostly given up on this season

Not expecting much in CL as well with our goalscoring record",Chelsea,Yes,j7a8iym,t1_j7a8b1j
"Liverpool have won about 5 trophies under Klopp lol. U are right about the intensity thing, if we could get 4-5 good years with Potter and then hand the team off to a new manager to maintain the success, that would be perfect",Chelsea,Yes,j7cy2j8,t1_j7c7ghl
Mourinho and Ferguson also said nearly exactly the same thing,Chelsea,Yes,j7cu3yk,t1_j7crbwl
"Exactly. It's too easy to blame it on Haaland. 

There are way too many variables in football when it comes to form. For example, are their other players their usual selves? De Bruyne certainly isn't playing at the same level. They also have problems with their defence as Diaz and Laporte are struggling with form, and they've just lost Cancelo. And we have to realise that the majority of this squad has been playing at an extremely high level for years, and a slight regression is only normal (no team dominates the PL every year).

But Haaland certainly does make them play differently. And I don't think they've fully adapted to suit him yet ‚Äì which is terrifying. They often don't find his runs in behind and he's making them *all* game.",Chelsea,Yes,j7dexra,t1_j7cxhua
"Hmm, I wonder what we'll do with Colwill then, since he prefers the left. I'm not sure how Badiashile would fare, I've only watched him in Chelsea.",Chelsea,Yes,j7b12q8,t1_j7av54s
How much is he worth in your opinion?,Chelsea,Yes,j7aaglk,t1_j7a8odf
I‚Äôm going to see if I can iron it off using a tea towel over the top. It‚Äôs honestly embarrassing when play 5 a side BUT I do play with his ability üò≥,Chelsea,Yes,j7b3jjw,t1_j7agy9b
"How do you constantly show your abilities when you are stuck with mediocre ingredients. Man literally went unbeaten in the first 9 games before the team was wrecked with injuries.

">Makes no sense at all. Conte took us from 10th to title winners in 1 season. Tuchel took the players struggling at 9th under Lampard to Champions league winner in the same season.

How dare you compare what Conte and Tuchel had with what is available to Potter? Conte had a World class GK, defenders, midfielders and attackers. What's the injury record for Conte and Tuchel? What was Conte's result in the second season? What was Tuchel's performance for 2022?

>You see the difference? 5 months under Potter and we still don't know what system and identity he wants to implement.

The difference is neither Tuchel nor Conte had to deal with 6 - 9 injuries per game. It is difficult to have a stable system with unstable players.",Chelsea,Yes,j7akabl,t1_j7ajlme
This is essentially why we're buying Malo Gusto. People forget that Reece did play as a midfielder and was quite good. I can remember some games when Tuchel put him in as a mid and he was great.,Chelsea,Yes,j7b273w,t1_j7apx7u
They‚Äôve scored completely against the run of play too,Chelsea,Yes,j7bsh5f,t1_j7bqouo
"Interesting analysis. Is Mount out of a defined role in a 4-3-3 or similar then?  
He‚Äôs obviously not as good on the wing as our new signings and laid a massive egg in the midfield pivot-2. 

Maybe he could work as the support to the marauding fullback (James)? They already link up well and would allow James to be further up and involved in the midfield too.  
Basically the Henderson-TAA dynamic.",Chelsea,Yes,j7bi73c,t1_j7awon8

"The complaining and criticising doesn‚Äôt actually change anything.

I‚Äôm sure he knows that we‚Äôre a bit shit at the moment too - the constant attacks from fans won‚Äôt suddenly help",Chelsea,Yes,j7a8t2u,t1_j7a86ie
"Maybe the mods reacted to the constant criticism they were getting about removing posts, censoring stuff, and generally being nazis, so decided to step back. 

I agree, some of the stuff that stays up ridiculously low quality, and there‚Äôs a high number of dupes. 

I wouldn‚Äôt want to mod here. People who do get banned just come back with another account and spout the same bollocks. It‚Äôs tedious to watch.

Even the daily discussion threads are getting as bad the match threads now.",Chelsea,Yes,j7cuxj7,t1_j7cu2sj
"All good, the sub continues to grow, and everyone has an opinion on its latest evolution. The truth is the place is relatively organic and we‚Äôve hit as good of a balance on moderation levels for as long as I‚Äôve been modding, so over 5 years now (yikes).

People have different levels of visibility on the things we do and say, and different perspectives on whether it‚Äôs right or wrong. Nothing new, always curious to hear what people think",Chelsea,Yes,j7d0oj6,t1_j7czxrp
"‚ÄúSometimes‚Äù lmfao. There is absolutely NO proof of Potter being able to make ‚Äúshit good‚Äù for Chelsea if we give him time. 

Don‚Äôt mention Arteta because he won a trophy and wasn‚Äôt backed by 600m. 
Don‚Äôt mention Brighton because Potter finished 9th with them and went 3 months without winning or even sometimes scoring a single goal at the Amex. 
Don‚Äôt mention injuries because every single team goes through injuries, and even through injuries we have been lucky to have players like Havertz, Koulibaly, Silva, etc. Potter has always had world class players at his disposal despite injuries.

And after all that ‚Äúfantastic job‚Äù he supposedly did, Brighton have still not won anything, and De Zerbi is coaching them much better than Potter ever did. Just ask Brighton fans if they‚Äôd want Potter back.",Chelsea,Yes,j7a55yb,t1_j7a4nz6

U guys fall for media hype so bad, Pep likes Potter cuz hes Harmless and weak now",Chelsea,Yes,j7cogfv,t1_j7ckom7
"Fuck off you weird Bot.

Pretending that some random rumour that Tuchel committed some heinous unrevealable act and had to be sacked on the spot has any credibility is absolutely hilarious when it was clearly just a click bait throw away comment on talk sport.

Pep always praises shit managers after he whips them comfortably. He wasn't praising Tuchel when Tommy beat him 3 times in a row including the CL final.

The worst season of Tuchels entire managerial career has been better than Potters best season, not one other club on the planet would have took Potter over Tuchel if given the choice between both their careers really speak for themselves.",Chelsea,Yes,j7clci2,t1_j7ckom7
"You Tuchel fanboys seriously need to get over him!  He was sacked for being a difficult person to work with.  He got himself fired.  So all your crying is just wasted breath, because HE IS NOT COMING BACK!",Chelsea,Yes,j7adl53,t1_j7aclun
"He won the swedish variant of the league cup or fa cup (where he bested top flight teams)

He also took them from lower divisions to the highest playing an expansive brand of fotball

He also took said team in the european success

First he managed to get trough playoffs to Europa League for the groupstage (besting poak, galatasaray in the process) then in the group stage they finished 2nd (equal points to bilbao)

Then he went into the playoffs where he managed to beat arsenil at emirates but loosing by a goal over 2 legs.

He clearly did a great job there, and he should have a lot of credit for it.

For me this was alot more impressive then what he did at brighton (knowing swedish and pl fotball)

That beeing said, if we manage to keep most of this squad healthy I want to see an increase in chance creation, or he has to go.",Chelsea,Yes,j7ada40,t1_j7aclun

"Dumbasses are falling over themselves to think of excuses why Potter can't be expected to win any game.

Someone on this sub yesterday said Dyche has it easy at Everton and it's no surprise he beat Arsenal in his first game because he has a group of players that know the league but we can't expect to win games or us to score a goal 5 months after Potter  took over because he's had so much money to spend and so many new players.",Chelsea,Yes,j7bc9wv,t1_j7banlp

Agreed. That profile of striker does seem to suit us well.,Chelsea,Yes,j7bsas6,t1_j7bqvdo
Marcus Thuram will be free in the summer. And probably would not complain about not being the 1st choice.,Chelsea,Yes,j7c0zpg,t1_j7bqvdo
"Leaves us with Enzo, Rice and Gallagher in the pivot.",Chelsea,Yes,j7cyw9b,t1_j7cir35
Need a casemiro more,Chelsea,Yes,j7c6gr4,t1_j7c4ija
"A lot of teams make do with 2 same footed players, but ideally, any team that plays from the back wants 1 left footed and 1 right footed CBs for optimal passing angles. Easier to build and evade press that way. Also left footed players are usually always used at the left side of defence because how rare they are. 

Arsenal's starting CB pairing consists of Gabriel (L) and Saliba (R) with Kwior (L) and White (R) as backups. United's starting CB pair are Martinez (L) and Varane (R). City have Laporte and Ake as left footed CBs and although their defensive rotation is weird this season, both have been signed for the reason I listed above. Real Madrid's starters at CB are Alaba (L) and Militao (R). Bayern had Hernandez (L) and De Ligt (R) until Hernandez got injured.",Chelsea,Yes,j7bu0cv,t1_j7bpokv
"u/Lazyan was right, I was a fool for thinking you would be receptive to feedback from someone who literally agrees with your support of Potter.",Chelsea,Yes,j7ajns7,t1_j7ai35i
"Lavia or Kone would be my pick, both are likely to be much cheaper, particulary Lavia if Southampton get relegated. Rice or Caicedo are very good mind you, but I just don‚Äôt see the need to splash that much money for the DM position.",Chelsea,Yes,j7avdx9,t1_j7au391
"I think Caicedo roams too much to be the best partner for Enzo. Macallister drops down to help create some solidity in that midfield. He is like Kante in that they both roam and collect the ball and do defensive duties all over the pitch. I like him and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll work if we did get him but for the price not sure if worth.

I think Rice is the obvious choice but money again Olaya a role and if we aren‚Äôt in CL I do think he goes to Arsenal. As he‚Äôs been saying he wants to play in that competition and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs moving.

Zubimendi has a 60mil release clause which isn‚Äôt cheap but he‚Äôs a certified DM and he‚Äôs Spanish so you can have midfielders who speak the same language communicating with each other. I think he looks good, is pretty good aerially despite his height and I think he can play in PL. he‚Äôs like a more physical busquets but less talented in progression.

Lavia could be a good option if City don‚Äôt think on buying him back which I do think they will if they get relegated. If he doesn‚Äôt get bought back, I think he would be a good option for.  Very raw still but has a lot of upside and is getting better each week.",Chelsea,Yes,j7becpm,t1_j7au391
"I'd guess that there will be three significant signings in the summer. 

One is Caicedo. Why? Well, his stats this season are comparable to Kante's throughout his career and he is precisely the type of midfielder we need. He's not an offensive outlet, but he is very good defensively. He'd be a great cover for Enzo in a midfield duo. 

One more midfielder. Somewhere between an offensive/creative outlet and a solid defender. Essentially a good box-to-box midfielder. Rice would be good here, but he would be very expensive and there are cheaper/as good players in this position. We also still have Kovacic, which makes it more likely that we'd go for a cheaper and younger alternative. I'd say that someone like Zubimendi would be a great addition, but keep in mind that we do have Casadei and Santos who could be a backup to Kova. 

We're certainly not going for a striker this season. We're going to have Nkunku in the summer with Fofana/Broja as backups + we still have Lukaku on the books. And I do expect that we'll sign Joao permanently who can also play up front. 

I also think we're unlikely to go for a new keeper. Keep does have his blunders, but statistically he's one of the best keepers in the league. His xG vs conceded goals is fantastic. Slonina is likely to be his backup/cup keeper. 

Generally, I'm not sure we \*need\* much more. What we need is time. Time for the players to settle into Premier League, learn each other's play and time for Potter to figure out how to play them. 

That game on Friday didn't much change my mind. This squad has the potential to be an absolute juggernaut, but it won't happen tomorrow. Of all the players we bought two resemble a finished product, Badiashile and Enzo. Why? They both played at high level and performed there. Everyone else needs time and most of the first team needs rest.",Chelsea,Yes,j7b1wv4,t1_j7au391
Kolo for sure,Chelsea,Yes,j7binx3,t1_j7b51xi
"Broja injury is so so frustrating

Rest of the season would have given us plenty time to assess his true level and see how he fits in with the rest of the new attack",Chelsea,Yes,j7avouo,t1_j7aux1o
I don‚Äôt think we are getting a new striker. Potter made a comment about our striker situation and said something like ‚Äúthe winners of the last 4/5 years didn‚Äôt have a true striker‚Äù so I think we do sign Felix and play him and Nkunku as rotating ‚Äústrikers‚Äù both off strikers playing off each other. Interesting how that‚Äôll go as both players better next to an actual striker but that‚Äôs what it looks like we‚Äôre going for if Potter is still around in the summer,Chelsea,Yes,j7bdjnw,t1_j7aux1o

maguire only cost 80m because he‚Äôs homegrown. and he was better at leicester than fofana too,Chelsea,Yes,j7btga7,t1_j7bafiy

"Wikipedia for meanings of words and phrases is new. Regardless, it doesn't contradict what I said. I said watching Burnley play was a guilty pleasure of mine and it is. Watching them frustrate Arsenal or City or Liverpool or United was hilarious and very very fun to watch. So I'm not taking it back. 

You're the one who took it to mean that liking his team means being a fan of Brexitball. Even though I mentioned, *one sentence earlier*, that my attraction was how it frustrated football hipsters.

I liked Zidane's Madrid and Nagelsmann's Leipzig too. It doesn't mean that I watched every match that they played. It meant that I would tune in to some matches if my time permitted. The same with Burnley playing a top 6 team.

You created a strawman from nothing that I said, called me a liar, and then are asking me to take what I said back because you are mad at someone who I never mentioned.",Chelsea,Yes,j7aekha,t1_j7adpz9

"It's not a bad shout. Mount has the engine but does he have Hendo's positional discipline or the nous in the tackle? Whenever we've pushed Mount deeper he's looked a little lost. I don't think he has Henderson's sense for when to keep things simple in deeper areas of the pitch and when to try a worldie. I'm not saying it wouldn't work but I do think it's not a coincidence that no manager wants him in the pivot (let alone as a 6). Most managers have elected to push him high up the pitch where his press and good first-touch on the half-turn can be utilised. Henderson on the other hand tends to sit much deeper and cover for TAA, as you say.

That said, maybe Klopp turns him into a Hendo? If there's anything to the Liverpool rumours.

And yeah, I think he's outta luck in a traditional 433. At least one 8 (normally the left-sided one) needs to have a final ball. He *could* be the 8 that has less creative responsibility, but he's been given the most whenever he's been one of the two 8s in a 433. But even then, the deeper or less creatively-responsible 8 needs to be more comfortable recycling the play and being progressive than Mount is (someone like a Kova or Kante).",Chelsea,Yes,j7bw6l8,t1_j7bi73c

"The last paragraph reads of City‚Äôs impending relegation, which would be hilarious.  
But yeah I think they buy Lavia back given their impending summer exodus. 

Rice would be great but as you mention we‚Äôve pretty much played ourselves out of the pole position to sign him due to (a fairly likely chance of) missing out on UCL.  
The only draw we might have left for him is a very nice payday AND a push from Mount (which would involve another big payday, else he may just leave too which would be another topic).",Chelsea,Yes,j7bj2dq,t1_j7becpm
"Just wanted to touch on that Enzo and Badiashille are 22 and 21, they still have plenty of room to grow as well. I know they have looked the most composed and played the best so far but they‚Äôll only get better",Chelsea,Yes,j7bd7yc,t1_j7b1wv4
"Crucial young players keep picking up serious injuries which we can't assess the long-term effects of. It's really difficult to do proper long-term planning as a result.

What if Broja loses even 10% of his acceleration due to this latest injury, for example? It's so key to his game and yet we've got no idea whether he'll still have it when he comes back. We've been really unlucky the last few seasons with injuries like this tbh.",Chelsea,Yes,j7axrcr,t1_j7avouo

"Yeah, I doubt Mount would sit back and not drift. /u/baisabeast also pointed out ‚Äî Mount doesn‚Äôt have the discipline to perform the Henderson role. 

I think there is spot for Mount in a 4-2-3-1, as the CAM. But then his competition for that role is Felix at the moment (a superb player), or Havertz if he is not playing as striker (who‚Äôs decent at this role too, and plays off another striker very well). Tough odds.

"You can complain all you want but evidently all it does is just make people more on edge. 

Conditions have been outbid our control for a while now. With a settled squad and time to bed in our signings then it‚Äôs reasonable to expect more.

"Why are you using Tuchel as an example? If Boehly gave a shit about what the average tan had to say then Tommy T would still be here. 

Our current approach is clearly with the next 5 years in mind. Dropping a couple of points against Fulham has no bearing in the grand scheme of things. 

All I want to see for the rest of this season is a consistent line up and style of play to be implemented. I want our new attacking unit to have more games to gel and be productive so we‚Äôre ready for the next season.

You‚Äôre not plastic if you expect a team half made up of new signings to magically gel and beat one of the in form teams in the league first time out - just an idiot. 

Our midfield was shite but we had three first team midfielders out injured - who else would‚Äôve played?

If Havertz could score any of his tap ins or Fofana has a bit more composure then it‚Äôs an easy win. I don‚Äôt think potter can be blamed for those misses.

"Absolutely, there's an argument to be made that Chelsea has the best U-23 team in Europe. I'd that in terms of young talent we have a team on par with Real and Barca. 

The problem is that people don't expect them to grow, but to be world class already. But that will take time. They have plenty of talent and some are even ready physically, but the psychological adjustment will take time. I know that there are worst things to be than a 23 year old multi-millionaire, but it's a huge change, it would be in anyone's life and they need to find themselves as men, as well as players. 

Same goes for Potter. He too needs to adjust and to start performing, and while he will get this season, if there is no improvement at all, he will have to go.",Chelsea,Yes,j7bp1mx,t1_j7bd7yc

"Imagine how different things would look if everyone you mentioned didn't sustain serious injuries. Livramento looked like a demon for S'ton, but now he's getting recovery setbacks from the ACL. Lamptey is perpetually on the treatment table. CHO has lost that 5 yard burst that made him electric in the youth setup. Rubes is doing okay but it's undeniable that he seems less mobile now than he was pre-achilles. 

It's just fucking shit to be honest. Add James and that's 6 very talented academy products struggling to physically develop in a linear fashion toward their peak years. So much potential possibly lost.",Chelsea,Yes,j7az6aq,t1_j7ay1ia

"I see the stats, but the players on the list should be seen with context of their team and the eye-test. 

For instance, Grealish is at the top. I would take a large number of players below him over him in the team, because he massively benefits from a system that enables him and others in his position to succeed.   
On the contrary, Chelsea had a slow year in offense and really fell behind after the UCL campaign. 
Reece is our best creator and he's just middle of the pack. Stands to reason that other Chelsea players would be much further below.  
I'll chalk CHO to a bit of supersub occurrences. 

But I get the point. Mount seems to have been built into prospering in a role within 3ATB which we don't (and likely wont) be using anymore, and doesn't seem to be able to outperform other players in the new role he needs to play.  
Yet. Hoping he can figure it out.",Chelsea,Yes,j7cii6x,t1_j7c5psx
"Lampard had Kante. I don‚Äôt think Kante has played a single game under Potter yet. Until Potter can have a consistent run with a consistent line up I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to call for his head.

"Maybe you should take a bit of a step back from football because you sound a bit deranged. 

Obviously I‚Äôd prefer we were doing better at the moment. But you must be new if you genuinely believe you can thrive with the current circumstances. Potter has to integrate half a squad of new signings with multiple key players out for prolonged periods of time. 

I‚Äôm all for Chelsea having a more sustainable long term approach rather than the previous cycles of success and mediocrity. 

We no longer have Roman to bail us out every other season. If you‚Äôve been paying attention you notice that we‚Äôre trying to put together a set up that will promote sustainable success. We have secured bright talents for the best part of a decade. We‚Äôve invested heavily in future youth prospects. We have a whole new scouting and technical director set up for the first time in ages. 

None of this is for instant success. You need to be patient otherwise don‚Äôt start celebrating 5 years down the line when we have back to back titles and minimal ongoing spending.",Chelsea,Yes,j7aewj5,t1_j7acgm6

He could go full Mourinho but there‚Äôs probably a reason why he doesn‚Äôt last longer than 3 seasons anywhere. It‚Äôs clear we‚Äôre trying to be serious about the long term

It‚Äôll be better for your own mental health to accept that this is the manager we have and it‚Äôs going to need a bit of patience to see results.

"The coach clearly isn‚Äôt shit given his success in Sweden and Brightons progress. 

Is he elite? No, I‚Äôd agree with that. But it doesn‚Äôt mean he couldn‚Äôt be with time. 

As I‚Äôve said numerous times no manager would find it easy to integrate 6-7 new signings into the line up, with a World Cup half way through the season and having your best players injured for prolonged periods. 

Even when Felix came in he got suspended straight away - what‚Äôs Potter to do about that??",Chelsea,Yes,j7afil8,t1_j7af331

"Enzo is exactly what we needed, can't think of another player (maybe Kimmich) who can look like a natural anywhere in midfield. We can easily use him as a lone no6, he's simply excellent in and out of possession. But he probably would like a bit more freedom to show his progressive and offensive capabilities. 

Really glad the club decided to fork up the money for him because there's simply no alternative to him in the market.",Chelsea,No,j75o5hf,t3_10t6kdr
"I‚Äôm beginning to think Mount can‚Äôt even play a b2b midfielder. He crowded the spaces Havertz and Mudryk needed, successfully forcing the former to drop deep (if only he‚Äôd exploit the space left behind) and isolating the latter on the touch line. As if making 2 players appear worse than they were, him and Gallagher offered absolutely no help to Enzo who was at times unable to receive the ball or had to drop between the CBs. 

Misplacing passes and slow decision making are one thing but actively making 3 players play worse is a whole another problem that is alarming. I think I know the reason for it, Mount saw Enzo‚Äôs highlights and went ‚Äúso this guy spams through balls over the top, better make sure to be near the goal for one of them‚Äù.

Then there‚Äôs Gallagher who isn‚Äôt even playing bad for his standards but slows the game by his lack of football iq. He runs though.

As long as we will have Gallagher and Mount starting, the problems will persist. Sell Gallagher in the summer, get a proper pivot pairing for Enzo and decide what to do with Mount.

Zakaria, Kova and Felix can‚Äôt return soon enough.

Also very pleased with Madueke, and Enzo is just incredible. I slagged off Fofana yesterday for not passing to Havertz but he couldn‚Äôt have seen him, I apologise. Badiashile is an incredible signing, I had doubts on how he‚Äôll play without Silva but yesterday I saw him command and correct players‚Äô positioning on multiple occasions. I feel for him for not making the CL squad, he deserves it but we need others more.

Cucurella wasn‚Äôt great yesterday but gets too much hate. He has to cover for Mudryk and also help to put out fires in midfield. Often he was central to help Enzo and got exposed because Mudryk lost his runner. I like Enzo as a sole 6 but he needs a DM next to him to get the best of him. Even Kova would do, maybe even Santos if he adapts to the PL.

And lastly, and I apologise for a long post, no matter how excited we were for this match, it was always going to be a difficult one. Fulham are tough, well organised and intense whereas our squad was largely the same as it was the last time we faced them. New signings are not plug and play, we‚Äôre always going to struggle because of that in combination with the underperforming usual suspects and injuries. It‚Äôs a slow ascent, we‚Äôll be better with every game, it‚Äôs still a project. A lot of positives too, we kept 3 clean sheets in a row.",Chelsea,No,j760dgr,t3_10t6kdr

It may be that Chelsea hasn‚Äôt scored a lot of goals recently so everyone is pushing up the field to try and get one but my god we can‚Äôt play with only one guy in the midfield. Mount and Gallagher need to drop and learn the midfield dance with Enzo. FLUIDITY, that is what made xavi, iniesta, and busquets work so well.

Enzo was absolutely crazy. Even the stats don't do him justice. He was isolated and locked in the midfield and still impressed in a basically solo midfield, in only his secondary position.

Badiashile was great, and Silva was excellent in complementing him. It's always good to see a senior being the one to actually cover the new players and not vice versa.

Reece was solid although nothing stellar, which is more than enough for a recovering player.

Besides those, I also think the hate on Kai is unjustified. He's been getting on the end of passes and were unlucky with his shots, which admittedly also need improvements. I think normally he would've scored today. Hating him on his finishing is one thing, but if it's for his decision making and involvement tonight then it's plain unreasonable.",Chelsea,No,j75mr56,t3_10t6kdr

"Let‚Äôs say everyone is fit and available. The back line needs little debate over who starts, so what do we do with our midfield? Double 6 or a 3 man midfield? Enzo is nailed on, who partners him and where does he play?

A double 6 is the best option based on the attackers we have imo. Either next to Kova/Kante and Enzo stays a bit behind; or next to Zakaria who offers more defensive cover (although we‚Äôve yet to see him as a DM) and Enzo gets more freedom? 

A midfield of 3 with Enzo as a 6, Kova and an another attacking b2b(although I don‚Äôt feel confident about any of remaining options). Or Enzo as an 8 next to another attacking b2b with a dm behind?

Either way, we will need to buy a mobile defensive midfielder in the summer. I think 4231 is the way to go from now on, we have starting quality wingers in Mudryk, Sterling, Madueke and Ziyech, and players that should be played behind the striker in the 10 role in Felix/Nkunku. Who do we go after? Enzo-Rice would be good but expensive, especially when Rice could be unnecessary against teams that sit deeper. I‚Äôm not exactly sold on Caicedo or Onana. Worth a thought, we have time until the summer.

What do we do with the striker situation? Havertz might come good but the Club must be running out of patience, I‚Äôm willing to give him time until the end of the season. If he leaves we will likely need 2 strikers if Broja doesn‚Äôt recover. Who do we buy that isn‚Äôt just a target man but can get involved in buildup and be fluid with surrounding players? Is Vlahovic good at that? His stats are poor but that could be due to Juve‚Äôs playsyle. I definitely don‚Äôt want to play Nkunku as a sole 9. What do we do?

You don't have to hold on to one of them to make it work, you make it work despite them, they add their own quality to it, but the project is independent.

"I keep seeing the sentiment that De Zerbi has unlocked a next level Brighton, and that this is proof of some inherent flaw with Potter proving he has a very low ceiling.

6W - 1D - 3L

GF: 23

GA: 16

GD: 7

GF: 22

GD: 15

Our backline, depth and players to join are ridiculous, first choice players just need fitness. James and Chilwell don‚Äôt look their peak best by a long way, that comes with a few games for fitness.

Enzo sitting in midfield pinging balls about is one of the large missing pieces for creativity we needed. The second will be Felix on for Mount in central attacking mid making shit happen. Add two wide players around him who can run at defences, and a bit of familiarity and things become great.

We improve again when we match Enzo with a specialist defensive 6 to cover him and to add work rate and grit. Whether it‚Äôs Caicedo, Rice or whomever, it will happen in 5 months, as will the joining of Gusto, Nkunku and Santos.

We will improve immeasurably signing a top shelf striker who knows how to be a striker.

Felix still hasn‚Äôt played with Enzo and Mudryk, from the next match onwards our attack will start to look more creative and cohesive.

The main issues are that Havertz, Mount and Gallagher need to start riding the bench, and in the next few weeks we will have the players available and fit to make that a reality.

Don't think any team had ever closed this much of a gap to the top4 in the history of the league anyway, so Europa was always the realistic expectation and that is well within reach if the team starts clicking within a few weeks. 

Also, unrelated, but fucking Willian was so good. Constantly got out of pressure and was great dribbling in tight spaces. Somehow, the bloke is not finished.

Kai can backup Felix playing behind DDF. Maybe he‚Äôll learn something by watching Felix play. Mount would probably be 3rd choice now at that #10 position but really he and Kai can battle it out for the backup role. 

Hope Mudryk gets healthy quick. Definitely wasn‚Äôt himself tonight. Think as he and Enzo get more time together there‚Äôs going to be some lovely through balls played to Mudryk from deep.

We can be fair and say we overspent on nearly every player we bought, we undersold on nearly every player we sold. In terms of value for money, the past two transfer windows have been disasters. Just to give as an example: sterling, cucurella and fofana we bought for a combined 200 million. Is there anyone that would have thought this is a good way to spend 200 million before we spent it, let alone now in hindsight? On top of that, we let werner leave for nothing

I just don't understand why when we decide to spend a lot we do it by overpaying for players that aren't actually world class. The same goes for mudryk and enzo, sadly.

">  Is every managerial change accompanied by the team getting knocked out of all but 1 major competition

Why ignore the fact we were drawn away to Man City in both cup competitions? Not like we were getting tonked by lower league teams.


Also we aren't the first team to have a huge injury list, but equally we aren't the first team who has struggled with results because of a huge injury list. Dumb to handwave it away. 


We're still missing all our central midfielders other than Enzo (Zakaria, Kovacic, Kante), James made his comeback but is clearly taking is slow, Chilwell made a late comeback, Mudryk was unwell, Felix was suspended etc. Give it time you inpatient child.",Chelsea,Yes,j77h3ru,t1_j77cscx

I can't remember the last time the team has needed such a huge overhaul, maybe after the 2012 run? 

This is our biggest rebuild in recent history and the fact you say our current standing in the league and cup competitions isn't the shit that happens in a rebuild might indict you've never paid attention to a true rebuild. You don't have to go far and just look at arsenal over the past couple of years.

"He gets put on an island defensively every week for one. There is only so much he can do when he's defending in acres of space everytime the oppositions sends it wide left. 

Hes been poor going forward but hasn't had a dangerous player in front of him to work off of as well as getting no support defensively which makes him even more erratic in possesion. The team has struggled to retain possesion in the opponents half like under Sarri or Tuchel and the constant loss of possesion by the forwards leads to him getting targeted on the break more often than he should.

"But under Tuchel they were being told to pass backwards? Players have their own mind. No managwr is telling a player to pass backwards, and no manager is telling two 8s to play in the box like that.

"*We* have nothing to do with the process. Potter is here to stay.

This is how the ownership proceeds. They disrupted the entire club from top to bottom so they know this isn‚Äôt an easy job and they picked Potter from data analysis. They‚Äôre giving him time and certainly not judging on the chaos this season has been (some injury related, some the owners have themselves generated).

No one is going to fix this overnight. Even Tuchel struggled at the start of the season having to integrate new players on top of injuries and a botched preseason.

Now Potter is managing an enormous squad of 30+ players, unprecedentedly big in football. It‚Äôs an NFL roster in comparison to other clubs.

That means drilling a team is a LOT harder. It would be hard for any manager.

The players available change wildly game to game, new faces to integrate every new, injuries at key positions.

This is a ride your bumps phase. It‚Äôs a squad with 18 new players compared to last year, they literally don‚Äôt know each other. A lot of them are project players as well.

The requirement now is to get some of these new players up to PL speed so they can be week in, week out starters next season, and try and build a cohesive unit by the end of the season.

There will be no sacking anytime soon. The club has yet to refurbish its medical staff, performance department, and to trim the squad to a manageable size. Those things aren‚Äôt on the coach, they‚Äôre both complicit in the circumstances that led to this season.",Chelsea,Yes,j76mf1y,t1_j76kds3
"You're comparing the best results of Potters time at Brighton with the entirety of De Zerbi's time there.

Why not talk about the fact Potters Brighton were one of the lowest scoring teams in the league all 3 of his seasons there?

How he won 28% of his league games there across his tenure?

How he went on a double digit winless run every season?

Potter has came in and made us significantly worse literally not one person on the planet with more than 1 brain cell would dispute that.

The question is why do the Potter stans keep saying he needs years, another 600m, more players, less injuries despite still having a billion pounds worth of talent to pick from when pretty much every manager from De Zerbi to Dyche to Unai Emery to Lopetegui can come in and immediately stamp their identity on their new teams and improve results.",Chelsea,Yes,j77hrv4,t1_j77hkqu

This one of the couple of positions we need to strengthen in the summer. Kante isn't a DM, RLC could have been a cost-free option if he still had his legs. Kovacic will also needs a DM beside him for defensive cover. 

>Rice Caicedo Lavia Zubimendi Onana Bissouma , just naming different DMs.

Signing Rice would make the most sense as he is young, fit and affordable (I guess as he only have 1+1 years left on his contract). Also, he's been proven in the league.

Caicedo isn't a defensive midfielder per se. He's in between Essien and Kante.

Lavia is still inexperienced.

"willian was always great when in form. his touches, shooting, and technique were all at a high level. the problem was there would be swaths of games where he would do the bare minimum with no progression or end product. and he would get picked every week because jose did not know how to rotate.

but it is interesting that a lot of players even the ones who are considered technical have more bad touches and more questionable shot placements. when i think of past players, the top players did not have that as often. I'm thinking its the pace of the game in the prem that's escalated that's causing this because even 5 years back the league was not as rapid. so there is less time altogether to think or do.",Chelsea,Yes,j769uxf,t1_j75y83z

Make any excuse you want about having a healthier squad, etc. The fact is that the signs were there from the start. Do you really get that same feeling from Potter?

"I want to copy and paste a comment I made 3 weeks ago that is just as relevant today. Can you answer all this? Can you tell me why we should be patient? Here:

Potter just isn't a great coach. He has zero accolades, he wasn't even that great at Brighton, his greatest accomplishment is doing well in the lower divisions of a third rate league no one outside their country actually watches. He has zero charisma and wouldn't know how to inspire a monkey to eat a banana. The biggest reason he got the job is because he's easy to work with for overbearing owners.

In terms of accomplishments (except maybe Lampard), Potter is the worst manager we've had since Abramovich first took over. ""Trust the process"" doesn't work when the manager is just terrible. Sticking a fry cook in a 5 star kitchen won't eventually turn the fry cook into a 5 star chef; it just turns the 5 star restaurant into a fast food establishment.

There is literally zero reason to believe Potter will suddenly become a top coach when he hasn't been his entire career. We're expecting a manager to reach a level he's never proven he can reach before, instead of just sticking it out with Tuchel and expecting him to return to a level with the squad that he had reached previously.

For those who keep defending Potter, just answer this: why? What factual, logical, rational reason is there to believe that he can be a coach worthy of winning the Premier League, Champion's League with Chelsea (Because that's the bar, by the way, just in case you guys forgot what kind of club we are. Reaching top 4 isn't the bar.) What has he done to make you believe this?

The answer is nothing, btw. There is no logical reason to believe it. It's just hype.

A manager isn't going to become an amazing manager just by giving him time. What makes you believe that? Destiny? He needs to have some proof that he can be amazing in the first place. Potter has none of that proof.

Edit: And I want to add -- I agree having 3 managers in one season is a disgrace. But if it were up to me, we would've only had 1. I would've been more than content with giving Tuchel time rather than giving Potter time, because Tuchel has proven that he can be an amazing manager, whereas Potter hasn't. But since we're stuck with this amateur, I'd rather replace him immediately than keep crossing my fingers for something that has never happened (Potter being an amazing manager) to finally happen. 3 managers and 1 mistake in one season is better than 2 managers and 2 mistakes.",Chelsea,Yes,j75lwyu,t1_j75lmxn

Klopp inherited a team that hadn't won a major trophy in like 10 years. He finished eighth but he also made it to two cup finals. He was also on a much smaller budget than Potter. 


Ridiculous comparison",Chelsea,Yes,j79z8fh,t1_j79ofqc

"Plenty of new managers can get a bounce and play a style to win a few matches even against good teams. 

Potter can also be shit. But does it help to call out Stans who are fellow fans? Revolving door manager stans? Bohelyout Stans? 

Many things can be true at the same time, but we would rather from go from celebrating the Enzo transfer to divisiveness in 1 match.",Chelsea,Yes,j7730is,t1_j771t6l

"> more you bitch and cry on Reddit makes me convinced we're on the right track

I really don‚Äôt get these fans who seem to care more about winning arguments online than they do actually the team doing well‚Ä¶",Chelsea,Yes,j76dheo,t1_j767p1e
Potter will be gone after Dortmund do us.,Chelsea,Yes,j76dkrz,t1_j767p1e
"Look at the tough guy over there. Those truths are more personal opinions than anything, but do carry on if it makes you feel superior.

Yes, bitching and crying on Reddit is actually an indication of us winning things, it surely is not because we are managed by a clueless clown who had no idea of what he is doing at this level.",Chelsea,Yes,j76bgjt,t1_j767p1e
"1. You're right, Potter ain't going anywhere. The only way he does is if he agreed to a some sort of a 'performance clause' in his contract, but that has never been standard practice in football so I doubt it. Truth is that he's on a 5-year contract and if Chelsea sacks him, he'll be owed a mountain of money. 
2. Tuchel most certainly isn't coming back. His vision was too different from that of the ownership. There was no chance for it to work and no chance that he comes back. 
3. It's not about last night, it's about this season. We have been absolutely shit under Tuchel and then even more shit under Potter. If we're 'improving' because we're praying to football gods for Thiago Silva not to get injured so that we don't bleed goals, that's not improvement. Player attitude has been a problem at Stamford Bridge for years and there are no signs of that changing under Potter. 
4. I you want my opinion, for me it's not even about the results. It's about the complete absence of any idea of how to play. I couldn't tell you if we're trying to be a counterattacking team, or a possession/press team. No clue if we're trying to overload the sides or pass through the middle. It's like the whole idea is 'all right lads, let's have fun out there'. 
5. The injuries are a fair argument, but we're not playing 16 year olds from the academy. We were playing Mount and Sterling and Jorginho and Kovacic and we were looking like absolute f\*\*\*\*\*g bums. 
6. If you say that it's because the players are new, well that's a fair argument too. Then again, I could tell you that Mount-Havertz-Zyiech have been playing together for what? two years? and there is no progress there at all. 
7. You might criticise people who vent here all you want, but 'trust the process' isn't really a great mentality. Oh, and the team that invented 'trust the process' never won anything. 

Cheers!",Chelsea,Yes,j76jnyr,t1_j767p1e

"Wtf is this non nuanced take, just because that team won a CL while overcoming odds does not make it a good squad. Rudiger is gone, midfield and both wingbacks being some of the most important part of how they found success are still out with injuries. 

If you take rashford alone out of that United team, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to win a single game even vs Bournemouth.",Chelsea,Yes,j76fpwa,t1_j76462q
"Exactly. We are solid defensively now and Reece is just coming back. Not to mention Chilwell too. Regarding our midfield , we have to cope with the injuries this season. Enzo Kante and Zakaria are crucial. Kova is in piss poor form. We'll manage when Kante and Zakaria get back. Regarding our forwards , we got a lot of talented players. It will definitely take atleast 3-4 games for them to get settled and gel on the pitch. Our rebuild is nearly done. Just need to apply finishing touches in the summer by getting a DM/ST and a GK. We'll be back.",Chelsea,Yes,j75rebl,t1_j75quv9
Did he spend 250 mil in the summer? Did he set up the squad this bad druing pre season? You can clearly see this squad has been formed under 5-6 managers and sacking Potter would improve absolutely nothing,Chelsea,Yes,j75uwzi,t1_j75tgs9
"> Hell, I get sacked in football manager managing Chelsea when I finished 6th and people here claimed we need to give a full season to Potter after this horrific season

What do your FM moments have to do anything with real life and football?",Chelsea,Yes,j75x65q,t1_j75tgs9
"There is no point in sacking Potter , that's not how a project works mate. Get off football manager. Sacking a manager in the midst of a rebuild is exactly why a rebuild is needed in the first place. We'll be back to square one and then you'll say the same thing about the next manager and the manager after that.",Chelsea,Yes,j75tw9w,t1_j75tgs9
"Give him some time. He has always had a slow start. There are a few problems to fix, but direction is alright. As long as improvements are there, it should be ok. And there are improvements, but we need to see if we can sustain that. Being trigger happy is entitlement, and it needn't work. If potter didn't improve next year, maybe we should look at it. Right now it's too early, too hasty and probably too expensive",Chelsea,Yes,j75vfsl,t1_j75tgs9

"Then you stay with Tuchel, continue with someone the players didn't like, risk the league position being worse than it is now, and then have Enrique take over for Boxing Day with the team less use to his style and tactics (which inevitably take time to get use to) and then it would be Enrique isn't the guy because the same problems that existed under Tuchel and exist presently under Potter, would still exist with Enrique. Having a squad that's unmotivated, out of form for a year and some of them still wanting to leave and you get a disastrous season no matter who the manager is. The summer needs to be about getting players out and further improvements in. Potter needs a full preseason with the team. His team. I can't imagine we'll still be this bad next season. But if we are, then it's clear what needs to happen. Next season is about progress like United have shown this season. All of this talk about Potter is reminiscent of his first season at Brighton when their fans didn't think he was any better than Chris Houghton. Over time he proved them wrong and they were gutted to lose him.

Also, it's been several months now, I would have thought people would understand Tuchel wasn't purely sacked for results.",Chelsea,Yes,j75mz6h,t1_j75kxbr

Datro got that drog in him,Chelsea,Yes,j75o0cw,t1_j75ltmc
"Honestly think we should play him instead of havertz, nothing against havertz even though i have a couple things that he did wrong, but ddf might be a better option as a striker and not worrying about anything else besides goals",Chelsea,Yes,j75nm0u,t1_j75ltmc

"No. Like Mount, some people have it in for him win, lose or draw. Was he amazing? No. Was he shit? No. He was fine. He can‚Äôt take a fucking corner. The main gripe for me was how far apart the 3 midfielders are/were. It left Enzo isolated. With Gallagher, I feel like he‚Äôs often still trying to impress by running about like a mad man. But he contributed to some nice link up play a couple of times and broke up the play well. He was ok for me. Like most of the team. Same as James, Cucu, Mudryk, Mount, Havertz. Just‚Ä¶ fine.",Chelsea,Yes,j75p1ub,t1_j75oh34
"Yes, he was even messing up simple passes,baffled as to why he played the full 90",Chelsea,Yes,j75p3qa,t1_j75oh34

"Reasses next season, maybe around midway through.",Chelsea,Yes,j76019w,t1_j75x8lo
"Deffo would give him the entire next season or even two. We need to break the cycle of changing managers so often. Ancelloti , Conte and Tuchel are the managers that I wish had stayed and they are known to be good managers still. 

I never liked this about Chelsea, we hit a sticky patch and just change coaches, might work but it's not sustainable. We need one identity of playing and that's only attainable through longevity. 

Lastly, Arteta is a great example.",Chelsea,Yes,j75zcjl,t1_j75x8lo
He shouldn't be assessed on what he does for the rest of this season? If this poor form is how the season ends we should sack him before the start of the next season.,Chelsea,Yes,j763zlf,t1_j75x8lo
"I think he‚Äôll get the next 2 seasons tbh, we‚Äôve pretty much got a whole new team bar the few that will probably be sold in the summer anyway. They need time to gel and understand what Potter wants.",Chelsea,Yes,j7626k9,t1_j75x8lo
"I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so hard to be ok with Potter out, potter In or somewhere in the middle. I‚Äôd be surprised if a wait and see type of poster is saying Potter is great or perfect. Why do we allow such a difference of opinion to drive the name calling and hate in our fans? It‚Äôs utter chaos. Usually everyone is being fairly critical but the Potter Out crowd tends to only see other fans as clueless dumbasses and then the Potter In crowd replies with name calling.",Chelsea,Yes,j76s37h,t1_j76qr6d
"Fulham plays great fotball,

For me playing as defensivly solid as we did was impressive.

Badiashile had 1 defensive misstake but - what a defender to compliment silva.

Silva wad world class as usual.

Honestly considered how little he was tested james was cooked alot! Cucu actually not as much, especially since they overloaded there the whole game",Chelsea,Yes,j75n65b,t1_j75lml0
Quite obvious you lot only look at score lines. They were playing against 10 men since the 17th minute.,Chelsea,Yes,j776pv1,t1_j776dr8

"You really want Chalobah getting pressed on the ball in midfield and being responsible for taking the ball off the defenders to build attacks? Have you seen Chalobah on the ball?

"Gallagher was actually better than Mount yesterday, still doesn't mean he was good though.",Chelsea,Yes,j76ec6r,t1_j763mp0

"It's worse for us. At least Liverpool and Arsenal were justified in sacking their managers and bringing in someone to ""trust the process"". They didn't throw away someone that brought them huge success after hitting a bad patch like we did.",Chelsea,Yes,j76whjy,t1_j76w3bu
"So you should expect immediate results and if you do not get them it should lead to a reactionary firing, while simultaneously expecting long-term success with no drop-off? 

Arsenal are in 1st and you are choosing to look at a single game in the most competitive and parity-driven league as your sample size. Liverpool has been a better club than CFC for the last 5 years and was fighting for the quadruple last season, but we should look at only recent results and not failed transfers, injuries, or other issues, just solely managerial blame. 

Yet, at the exact same time, you wanted to keep TT, who, much like Klopp this year, had a successful run only to fall into the midtable. By your own argument, why should TT have been given time, since apparently, any falloff means that a change should occur because the process is no longer viable? ETH is having a great run, but if he falters or loses to a bottom-table team is he automatically out? The shifting goalposts and nitpicking of sample sizes essentially mean that no manager is safe unless perfection is achieved both immediately and long-term.",Chelsea,Yes,j77pipf,t1_j76w3bu
We have enough players to compete. We might not have a complete squad to win the league but we have a very competitive side. We can keep wanting more and more players but it's clear that the manager is underperforming,Chelsea,Yes,j75r15i,t1_j75pjwe
"Kante and Zakaria, if any going then yes if not we just less lucky than should be. If team would be assembled we could make few games with temporary replacement, but now when everyone is shite it's just too much. Bottom line is Zakaria and Kante is enough with back up from Enzo",Chelsea,Yes,j75rl1d,t1_j75pjwe
"Yeah, CEO and Manager. Those are my two positions I dream we got a good signing for",Chelsea,Yes,j75rrmm,t1_j75pjwe

We don't need a striker.,Chelsea,Yes,j760mm8,t1_j75pjwe
"If Klopp left Liverpool and said yes, I want to coach Chelsea next, then you‚Äôd be mental to stick with Potter. Even if our form turns around and we win every game from here on until the end of the season, I‚Äôd still boot him in a heartbeat to replace him with Klopp.

Klopp would never come here, but he‚Äôs an all-time great manager. Potter has done nothing at the top level yet. It‚Äôs not even a question. You go with Klopp ten times out of ten.",Chelsea,Yes,j78ogvf,t1_j78npaf
"One season is fine to implement his non-existent style. The multiple seasons bollocks was really just multiple transfer windows, not the case with potter, ideally only 2/3 players remain for a  complete squad for Potter. He has the rest of the season to do better than 10th, after that it will be Backing the manager Ole Style.",Chelsea,Yes,j7a3cx5,t1_j78npaf
No. At least Havertz gets involved if we don‚Äôt create chances. Auba is done.,Chelsea,Yes,j760hnb,t1_j75z6ba

"Looks to nice to manage such a ruthless club like Chelsea, guess we will have to wait and see

Think his maximum level is to manage club like Spurs",Chelsea,Yes,j77yyz4,t1_j77wnc9
"It's a good point lol. Ancelotti is a good example of a quiet guy at least inspiring in another way. Potter uses his emotional intelligence degrees to go about it another way, that approach has its benefits and disadvantages. I think the disadvantage comes when we're struggling, need more of a ruthless, inspiring leader in those times. Like if Simeone is here right now, he will find us a way to win, but maybe not the best football to watch long-term.",Chelsea,Yes,j780cjb,t1_j77wnc9

Del Bosque?,Chelsea,Yes,j77xk5b,t1_j77wnc9
My problem is its like he wants us to be playing fluid football with instantly over complicated formations changes when he should be doing the fucking basics first before complicating things. How is complicating it going to work out when the squad has been in constant change through injuries and signings when so many of them miss training or are only starting out. We're trying to run before we can walk.,Chelsea,Yes,j75xchp,t1_j75uszg

Good at short to medium passes
Good at progressing with the ball
Good to great in headed duels
When he shots to get it on target

He is bad at:
Getting shots of (his shot numbers are bad for a ambitious team) 
Getting the ball past the keeper

Surprisingly enough he is more or less equal to his expected goals this year, which means that neither him nor the team get him into good shooting positions

"Trying to position in between the line while occupying the half-spaces. That as a means of creating numerical advantage (2v1) against the fullbacks. Arsenal and City do this regularly. The issue with this setup is that both players (Mount and Gallagher) are not yet tactically adept at knowing how high and wide they should be. 

Here as usual, Fulham pressed in a 424. Cucurella should have inverted into the midfield (of course he's no Zinchenko) to compensate for the Fulham press. At the same time Ziyech making the wide run for the switch from BB as the defender is in a 2v1 disadvantage. OR Gallagher should have moved deeper, about 4 yards deeper (of course the defender won't follow him when he knows Ziyech is lurking behind. 

Tbh, Mount and Gallagher are too high. One wrong pass from any of the back 5 and we have the opponent overrun us.

A reason we struggled was Fulham tried to forced us to play wide where we had no pace and trickery (James just recovering; Cucurella isn't the best FB bombing forward; Mudryk on a cold; Ziyech always being Ziyech). We got better after the subs though.",Chelsea,Yes,j79g5y1,t1_j798w6t

"We don't even need him going forward, he can orchestrate from deep perfectly fine and his natural positioning when we're dominating possession should be pretty high up anyway as he should be in position to counterpress quickly. Think of Rodri for City - it feels like you see him pick the decisive pass just before the assist for half their goals. That's what Enzo is perfect for. 

What you really want is someone like Kovacic next to him who will take some of the pressure off him in our buildup and not leave him so isolated. Kovacic is also a lot better at driving forward with it, and is very good at playing through pressure together with another pivot midfielder, so there's a lot of different ways he and Enzo could progress play. Enzo would get slightly more time on the ball (so more chances to pick out switches or key passes through the lines), but he'd also be good at playing Kovacic into positions to drive forward (like Kova and Jorginho did so well).

That's the way forward for me.",Chelsea,Yes,j75r98w,t1_j75p29t

Simply look at the players Potter had and De Zerbi had. Look at the way those players were coached before Potter and the way they were coached before De Zerbi.

The difference is night and day. Brighton's board seems to be one of the smartest in recent years. Yet they never sacked Potter even when they were close to the relegation zone. That's not because of pity. 

>Potter has came in and made us significantly worse literally not one person on the planet with more than 1 brain cell would dispute that.

I have more than a single brain cell and I will dispute that. Results are not always directly correlated to perfomances. Take our last 4 prem games for example, Yes, poor results but underlying stats suggest several positives, especially in terms of chance creation.

I'm not really interested in comparing Potter's results during the span of a lengthy and protracted building project- it seems valid to compare his and de zerbi's results once the product was closer to finished.

And yes, so far we have a smaller sample size for De Zerbi but all the reports on his play style was that it's high-attacking football that has a clear downside of bleeding goals. The numbers so far back that up.",Chelsea,Yes,j77iccs,t1_j77hrv4

Even if he is a weaker manager to stamp his authority I do feel he will organise and drill them over time. 

Some form of positive pragmatic system that allows expression and directness similar to Brighton, and the player‚Äôs individual skill will eventually get it done. I think him imparting his system is taking longer partly as he‚Äôs a less experienced and influential manager, from the injury crises and the regular interruptions.

I think over time he will sort it out, but at a cost to us qualifying for the champions league unfortunately.

">The only reason Potter got hired is because this mythical great style of play the media kept pretending he had which for some reason has never resulted in any of his previous teams actually managing to consistently score goals 

To be fair, Potter's Brighton teams were pretty much the definition of shit finishing in front of goal, they consistently underperformed on their xG metrics by [an](https://understat.com/league/EPL/2020) i[ncredible](https://understat.com/league/EPL/2021) amount. Like, close to 10 goals per season(and for one season, above that figure). I don't think that it's fair to claim that it's entirely Potter's fault that his teams were shit at finishing, the man had to start the likes of Aaron Connolly, Danny Welbeck and Neal Maupay for his entire tenure there because he simply had no other choice.

It seems to be carrying on here as well, at least for the last 5 or so games, good xG, [godawful](https://fbref.com/en/squads/cff3d9bb/2022-2023/matchlogs/c9/schedule/Chelsea-Scores-and-Fixtures-Premier-League) [finishing.](https://understat.com/team/Chelsea/2022) I will admit that the creation side of it has been mostly lacking, which is mostly on Potter.",Chelsea,Yes,j76x9mu,t1_j76pk3k

If we bring in fucking winners like Mou or Conte now , they'll destroy the rebuild. Just like Tuchel. They aren't the kind of managers we need right now.

Enzo offered options by dropping deeper, meaning he still need to find a way to deliver the ball above an empty midfield by himself. While the 3 I mentioned usually opted a direct pass to Cucu or Ziyech. I guess the idea is to get the ball quickly to the wings and keep the other 2 midfield up top (because they evidently can't drive the ball well enough before getting closed).

When are we allowed to question the single factor that every player of our squad has in common (hint, it‚Äòs the manager who avareges .9 points per PL match!).

What is this project we are supposed to trust in? What is Potters idea for the team? What does he need to show at least some glimpses of promising football? To produce at least some results against the weaker opponents we are playing? 

Let‚Äòs be real here. In the last months our transfer business has been absolutely mad. I‚Äòm not complaining! But you have to be objective enough to see that it is absolutely crazy how we have spent money. Now if this produces results I‚Äòm all for it. It is Chelsea after all. It‚Äòs the club I love.

"For Liverpool I don't think they really did bring someone in to *trust the process*, they just hired a manager who steadily took them forward so they chose to make him a project manager after the fact. This is how it always should be, bring in a manager with no expectations of making them long term, see how well the club and the manager work together and then either stick with him through thick and thin or move on before too much damage is done. 


It's a real shame that they couldn't just put their egos aside and hire people to work between them and the manager (or just not fall out with the entire old board and putting Cech in a position where he chose to leave that role) if they didn't get along with him on a personal level. 


Though, given everything we've seen and heard and the recent reports that our board supposedly almost ended up getting into a physical altercation with the Benfica board whilst negotiating, I think it's fair to say that only the most mild mannered yes man is going to work for them unless they fully extract themselves from any part of the football side of the club (note that Eghbali explicitly stated during the bidding process that he would play no part whatsoever in running the football club and that Clearlake was purely there to invest money and make money later on)",Chelsea,Yes,j76ydov,t1_j76whjy

Feel like we could easily use a midfield 3 like yesterday, with him at the base with two 8s.

While I agree on him and Kova being an ideal duo when we're dominating possession, provided as another user mentioned they can work together, I do still wonder if he'll be even better if we can stick a holding defensive presence next to him. Kova can barely be relied on to play 10 games without getting injured anyway, so we will need Enzo to take up the progression burden most of the time and he seems to have showed that he can play that role well.

"I'd say the same if not for last night. But after that I was 100% convinced of Enzo's all round qualities, 1v3/4 all night is just unheard of. Not to mention Jude is no slouch defensively either, he can provide stability when Dortmund played 4231. My idea is because both can play 6/8, they can cooperate and alternate with each other.

And I did factor Andrey and even Casedei when I said that. I always believe we need 22 good players for the starting 11, so 4 good players for 2 spots. Not to mention it can help us play 433 too.

Honestly I don't know enough about Zakharyan to say more, so I agree with that point for now.",Chelsea,Yes,j76l7wn,t1_j76i7tn

Mount has gone from being an easy first name on the team sheet to potentially surplus to requirements. 

It‚Äôs be foolish to look at everything at face value - there will be plenty going on behind the scenes that we aren‚Äôt aware of.

"It‚Äôs been less than half a season. The entire club has been overhauled, and that‚Äôs an understatement. The club has changed from the medical staff to the coaching staff to the administration staff to the players. 18 new players since the summer.

That‚Äôs disruption and instability and it translates onto the pitch. It‚Äôs not even Potter who needs time, it‚Äôs the entire club with all the appointments needed at every level.

"You clearly know nothing about coaching.

There‚Äôs a reason all coaches want 23 players as an ideal squad size. It makes training easier, management easier. 

Training time is limited in the PL especially, and in your training sessions if you have 23 players you can drill them faster. Less players, more team exercises for those players. More players, less team exercises because they all need to train.

So yes, a squad with 4 first team GKs, 12 attackers and so on is harder to drill and manage. 

You do know why Conte hates rotation, do you? He can drill 14 players like no other; but he hates bigger squads because it‚Äôs a lot harder to do it.
Pep regularly sells players without replacements as he too prefers a smaller squad to drill team exercises.

It‚Äôs common football knowledge.

I‚Äôm pretty sure the sporting infrastructure knows this. But the multiclub model is yet to take place so for now, you gotta have this enormous squad. 

No Europe next season will force them to trim the squad and that will be beneficial to the coach on top of playing less games (Chelsea and Liverpool have played the most football in Europe the past 2 years, both impossibly injured and exhausted), there‚Äôs the huge advantage of having full weeks to train.

The teams who‚Äôve done best this season? Arsenal and Newcastle, the two teams with a set starting XI (most stables XIs in the league) and less games played in the top half of the league.",Chelsea,Yes,j76qpp6,t1_j76pfbr
Your opinion is not that of the ownership who handpicked a coach based on data and analytics. You can yell at the wall as much as you want. They have a plan and they‚Äôre sticking to it.,Chelsea,Yes,j76r7ms,t1_j76r0e1
"It‚Äôs easier to drill any small squad. 
That‚Äôs why no other club has a squad with the size of ours. 
It makes training sessions ridiculously impossible.

Yes, Potter has been there since September where he‚Äôs had the most injuries in Europe. A not so shocking fact since Chelsea had previously played the most games in all of Europe the past 2 seasons (the other being Liverpool who are struggling just as much with a world class manager). He‚Äôs had a full week to train the team exactly once in that time.

Now he has a million signings and still injury issues.

These aren‚Äôt excuses, these are circumstances the club also voluntarily created: a squad overhaul on steroids, new faces, very young players, a gigantic squad with 4 first team GK to 10 attacking players and so on. 

So they know they‚Äôre also responsible for this season. The medical staff was fired in season and yet to be replaced. They cleaned house but haven‚Äôt filled a lot of positions.

What happens off the pitch always translates on the pitch.

They‚Äôre not sacking him anytime soon. You can complain and mock the process or give ultimatums. This is the Dodgers playbook. They disrupted their roster radically, and were losing as a result in the short term, they didn‚Äôt sack the manager because they know what an impossible task it is to have so many new players all at once and manage them. They also picked Potter based on data and analytics, they aren‚Äôt going to be reactive.

Their job is only starting. They have to fill medical department, performance and data, more coaching support, and trim the squad in the next few months. They are prepared for the chaos, disruption is quite literally their MO.",Chelsea,Yes,j76pu7q,t1_j76orcb

"Do you really think that Mount and Gallagher were so far ahead because Potter told them so? You think Potter isolated Enzo and bloated the forward line on purpose? That‚Äôs just wrong lol, Gallagher always does this and so does Mount, they have low football iq and poor interpretation of space. I do think this will improve though, it was Enzo‚Äôs first match.

I don‚Äôt have problems with him starting Mudryk, Mudryk wasn‚Äôt an issue. You do need to understand why Ziyech started though, the club wronged him and Potter has to show him that he‚Äôs still a part of the squad. This is how you prevent issues in the dressing room. 

What did Potter do well since he came in? Prioritises attacking football, figured out that 3atb isn‚Äôt working, we‚Äôre much more efficient in playing through press with our keeper and our backline, we‚Äôre much more direct than under Tuchel, more vertical passes, more noticeable attacking patterns. He cut off the players he doesn‚Äôt want, his defence is well organised, he gives equal chances to young players‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs not faultless, but blaming him for things no one could improve is just stupid. It‚Äôs a project, he came mid season and got 7 new players in January. It‚Äôs a gradual rise.",Chelsea,Yes,j763w3v,t1_j762m3d

"> the man had to start the likes of Aaron Connolly, Danny Welbeck and Neal Maupay for his entire tenure there because he simply had no other choice.

The man chose to buy Maupay for ¬£20m.

You can't absolve him for the blame of every attacking player he's ever coached being unable to finish at every club he's been at over a long period of time.

W see finishing as an individual thing but when every player Potter has coached in his career significantly underperforms their XG (The same players at Brighton are no longer underperforming theirs now) I really do think we have to ask what sort of finishing drills are part of Potters methods and how he speaks about players in the final third.

Every player a manager coaches shitting themselves infront of goal for a decade can't just be bad look.",Chelsea,Yes,j76y1tr,t1_j76x9mu
"Adapting isn't how you set up for consistent success. 

Pep doesn't adapt, he forces the team to adapt to him and its a big part of why he's the most consistently succesful manager in the world.

Arteta didn't adapt and its a big part of why he's able to go toe to toe with City this season.

"So that's your answer? He has proven ""that he can build a squad and play exciting and attacking football and over achieve with minimum resources and losing his best players every year with Brighton.""

So let's break that down, yeah?

""He's proven that he can build a squad"" -- Brighton is still doing great without him. Was it him or was it their management that built the squad? 

'He's proven that he can play exciting and attacking football"" -- Potter has been extremely overrated from his Brighton days. He had plenty of no-win streaks; Google it. Look at their table finishes -- he joined in 2019, and during his tenure with them, they finished 15th, 16th, and 9th. Only last season he squeezed into the top half of the table.

15th and 16th. That's closer to relegation than midtable. Do you actually know what you're talking about?

""Over achieve with minimum resources and losing his best players every year"" -- Who the fuck cares, that's not his situation at Chelsea. At Chelsea he has near infinite resources and he keeps his best players every year. And how exactly did he overachieve? Instead of finishing 17th, they finish 15th? Great over achieving.

Again let me say it: there is no logical reason to expect Potter to suddenly become an amazing manager. You are high on hype and hope and you don't see it. This is not the right guy to ""trust the process"" with.",Chelsea,Yes,j75n3yp,t1_j75mjar

"Okay, I see. Please point out one thing you've seen on the pitch since he came that signals a forward thinking top class manager.

Here's what I mean. When De Zerbi replaced Potter, Brighton transitioned to this 4-2-2-2 shape with no real 9s and basically everyone acting as a creative outlet. From the second half of the 2021-22 season Arteta switched from forcing Guardiola-ball on his players to the current situational 10s, inverted full-backs system that relies on verticality and positional coaching.

Both of these were done in less than 6 months, and in Arteta's case, it became obvious that he only needs the players to plug a few gaps (and not an entire new 11). One Jesus and Zinchenko later, and it is finished. So yes, point out an evolution on Potter's part.",Chelsea,Yes,j76gz0o,t1_j76faqd

I was always willing to give him two seasons to prove his worth, but the reason you give manager that length of time say, is because you give them time for a rebuild, give him time for the players he wants for his style. But we've done an overhaul in two windows, minus a striker and another midfielder. Potter has less time to really prove his worth and I think that's completely understandable. 

The new players look better straight away, and James and Chilwell are back minus match fitness though which should improve soon. It's not all doom and gloom. If things still aren't clicking and at least seeing us score goals whatever the results, then I'll be getting worried. Potter will still be in charge come next season though, it won't change.

"It‚Äôs true. The pair is our most progressive, with probably just about enough defending, but Kova is significantly worse on the right. Changes his whole dribbling game and press evasion, which is by far his most valuable skill. It‚Äôd have to be Enzo there. So far he‚Äôs been a LCM with a little CDM in a 2 and 3. Definitely would take adjusting. With how disjointed and uncoordinated we look, it‚Äôd be nice to just have players in their best, most natural roles without overcomplicating it.

Our counter-pressing is so spread out and ineffective as well, so we probably need the pure defending and legs in midfield next to Enzo. Individual defensive ability of a Kante/Zakaria to make up for system failure. With a coordinated press and defensive shape I think Kova-Enzo would be enough for a good chunk of games behind Felix and other hard working forwards. In the shorter term we‚Äôd prob be better off with Enzo/Kova - Kante/Zak. 

Depends on fitness of course. So many variables with this squad right now lol",Chelsea,Yes,j767d85,t1_j75u1tk
">While I agree on him and Kova being an ideal duo when we're dominating possession, provided as another user mentioned they can work together, I do still wonder if he'll be even better if we can stick a holding defensive presence next to him.

I think that's not a bad idea in games that we expect to be contested in midfield. I don't hate a Kant√© or Caicedo type of player in games like that - a high volume ball-winner who doesn't play the deepest midfield role in our buildup (still allowing Enzo to dictate play and help us play out), but relieves defensive pressure on Enzo when there's a lot to do, lays the ball off to Enzo for him to hit transitions quickly. That's something we've been missing for a while and I'm sure it was part of the thinking behind Enzo, Mudryk, Madueke. 

Good thing is that doesn't need to be someone super expensive. It doesn't have to be 100m on Rice or Caicedo, because we're fine lining up with Enzo and Kovacic in games we dominate anyway. We can look at Lavia if Southampton go down or dig up some other talent for the role, or we can activate the clause for Zakaria.

"What struck me most about him was his game intelligence and reading of his surroundings. He honestly looked like someone who came out of Cobham and knew our players for years. 

I think a DM will allow Enzo more freedom to do both sides of the game according to the game situation and opponent. But the profile of that DM is tough to ascertain, I suppose a Kova is ideal because he can't both stay deep and protect and his dribbling offers a great variety to Enzo's passing range.

2, in 3 years all they've won is an FA cup thanks to buying out the ref



There is absolutely nothing to show that ""trusting the process"" will bring you more success than just bringing in a competent manager. In fact, history shows the exact opposite. 



The choice is not ""trust the process"" and ""[be at the] top of the table"" or don't trust is and not be at the top of the table


It's bring in a good manager and be at the top of the table this season or bring in a bad manager and **hope** that in three years we've progressed as much as Arsenal, instead of regressed as much as a team like United did under OGS or Liverpool under Rodgers. Whereas, if you bring in a good manager and they don't work out, you lose one year and then you get a new top manager instead.


It's not rocket science to work out which way of doing things is best and most reliable. If once you've found the manager that brings you to the top and proves themselves, you then want to back them through thick and thin, that's absolutely fine because he's already proven himself. Doing that with someone who is actively making you worse is at very best a gamble.

Looks a pretty clear gradual decline since the day Potter came in which is reflected in results, performances, culture around the club and the ambition of some of the supporters.

We were above Fulham before Potter got the job, they've since outplayed us twice and now sit above us.

You're obviously deluded though and not worth responding to if you think we've been prioritising or seeing attacking football since Potter came in, his style of play was dull at Brighton and it's dull here, literally that entire paragraph reads like you've just copied something from ""what makes a good manager"" because if you think we're showing more attacking patterns under Potter you're clearly not watching the games.

5 goals in our 12 games is astonishingly bad.  we've had more games with less than 0.3xg under Potter as we did under Tuchel. We create nothing regularly.

That being said playing hoofball would not even work with these players.

To me it's pretty clear who is in the wrong when I read between the lines of what's reported and consider how the owners carried themselves since the takeover. Everyone said the main reason why the owners sacked him is Tuchel not being willing to collaborate with the owners on transfers/sporting side of matters as they would like, the quotes above, or them selling Jorginho on the deadline day, are examples of the nature of collaboration the owners demanded.

They still have to trim the squad because it‚Äôs unmanageable at this size, get a proper medical staff, a performance department and add in coaching support.

I did miss Sterling there who can play both wings (although he's not someone I really see as a long-term option to count on), but Felix would get in ahead of him for me. Mount as a 10 is a catastrophe and I think if he doesn't significantly lower his demands he should be sold. 

I know it's almost overkill to get Felix in permanently, but if he does well the rest of the season we'd be silly not to try. This is an enormously talented player the chance to sign whom might not come again - he's one of those players you get if he's available for a somewhat reasonable fee. And I think it would be easier to convince someone like him, who can play all across a frontline, that he'd get enough minutes compared to a pure winger who's an automatic backup.

Plus, and this shouldn't be ignored - squads will simply have to be better and deeper going forward as the number of games keeps increasing. Plans to expand the Champions League and CWC, pre-season tournaments added in, ideally 4 competitions to make deep runs in. We've already seen how a season with deep runs in all competitions + the CWC wrecked the squad.

I don't know if I am lucky or not. I am actually enjoying the phase our club is going through right now. Results are disappointing but there's hope of exciting football in the near future. All our new signings have looked good and once they play together for a while I am certain we will get results along with it. I am not too phased as I've seen us go through worse and comeback stronger. I don't like to come here as much nowadays since the mood is quite depressing. Don't let good or bad things go to your head. I hope you all are doing good. Have a great weekend everyone.,Chelsea,No,j75fdct,t3_10scshz

"Such a great start with the new recruitsüëècounting on the injuries for the rest of the league to get us higher, i saw konate is out for 3 weeks, i think vvd is also injured, erikson is out and sabitzer might need time to gel so things look good for us we just need to pull our weight",Chelsea,Yes,j712rfa,t1_j70ydzi

"Because Chelsea fans have sung it for extended periods of time in the past. I mean like 10 minutes straight.

">I think we may need a mentality coach.

It's called a manager.

Anyone with a brain cell can see we need a decent manager, people are simply deluding themselves that Potter is one.

Actually in most cases they're not even doing that, whenever Potter is pointed out as the turd he is they simply select the 1 or 2 out of 1,000 managers that were absolutely terrible and turned it around and Pretend Potter will be part of this extremely tiny sample and not just one of the 998 Hodgsons or Moyes's or Scolari's that didn't based on absolutely nothing that Potter is showing.",Chelsea,Yes,j74hycp,t1_j74ffjb

I don't think they're rival fans, I just think we're going through this at the moment and it just hasn't been exposed yet.

"Well, I think playing the lone striker isn‚Äôt it anymore? Haha. I hope our fans come to see that this won‚Äôt be the way we‚Äôll be playing. 

Anyway, having Auba on the list gives no value if we don‚Äôt play him and he doesn‚Äôt want to play. It‚Äôd be the same as having injured Pulisic. I guess the management wants to make it clear that Auba is no longer on their plan.",Chelsea,Yes,j72lx1g,t1_j72hn1w

"Agreed. What this team needs is some consistency. No team in the prem has played more players or made more changes. What Potter needs to do most of all is settle on a starting line up and let the boys learn how to play together, it‚Äôs just been an impossible ask with injuries and additions.

"Really difficult. Nothing is impossible, but we'll be more reliant on the teams in the top four dropping points than on our own performances. 

United and Newcastle (the most likely ones to drop out if any do) dropped 21 points thus far, so if we simplify it and assume they may slip up just that little more (to account for us being slightly beyond halfway), we can drop a maximum of 11 points between now and the end of the season if we want to catch them. That's three losses and one draw or another combo just as small. With our new signings likely needing some time to bed in, that's a really tough ask (especially with our results against top-half teams this season so far). 

Our most difficult match in the next 9 (on paper) is Tottenham away. If we put in a really, really strong run through these coming 9 games we can start looking at the top four a little more seriously, but I wouldn't get my hopes up too much for that.",Chelsea,Yes,j71lqr9,t1_j71jwyq

Enzo does best when another player is able to do the dirty work in midfield, and although Gallagher is not amazing defensively, he has shown he is willing to run around and press like a madman to win the ball back which I think could help benefit Enzo in giving him some license to get forward. Whether we play 2 or 3 in midfield, I think Gallagher could be the best option we have amongst healthy players. Enzo, Gallagher, and RLC would be my preferred option though today.",Chelsea,Yes,j71dwzd,t1_j715wtf
"Hall showcased that he ain't ready to play Premier League minutes as a CM. Sloppy first touch and incredibly naive both tactically and on the defensive side of the ball. Loftus-Cheek isn't much better either, he labours around and had to be consistently directed around by Jorginho whenever they played together previously. 

With the options on hand right now a midfield three makes the most sense, helping to spread the responsibility around. Otherwise I'd seriously look at moving Chalobah into the midfield if we're going with a double pivot.",Chelsea,Yes,j71fzkn,t1_j715wtf
I feel bad for you mate. This is one of the most sane comments and people downvote on you. Smh. It can‚Äôt be helped. Wonder how long it will take for people to realize Gallagher isn‚Äôt it for a double pivot.,Chelsea,Yes,j72il4o,t1_j715wtf

"Technically he can leave, but won't be able to play as he represented 2 clubs this season already.

He can only play in leagues with different season schedule, e.g. MLS",Chelsea,Yes,j72uk7m,t1_j72ug0y
Only time will tell if it's good or not. Risk yes but I think we have still got it under control. As all new contracts are low and performance based. And new signings have signed for long contracts which puts in a commanding situation 2-3 years down the line.,Chelsea,Yes,j75fkds,t1_j75ed48

You are such an idiot. People are not being paid to support Potter or Boehly ffs.",Chelsea,Yes,j74vbew,t1_j74hdc5
"I think we've seen an influx of US fans with both the Pulisic transfer and the takeover, and a lot of them want Potter to succeed because they want Boehly to succeed. Potter is a symbol of the new regime.

I also think that a process ‚Äì and the trusting of this process ‚Äì is in vogue. The media see what Arteta has achieved after years and years of squad building, and they now think that a few chosen managers will follow in his footsteps if given the same time. Many people here share those notions and believe a similar level of success is inevitable.",Chelsea,Yes,j74jl8n,t1_j74hdc5

"It‚Äôs a big ask, we may have some valid reasons and excuses but got to push hard and build momentum for next season, 70 points mark is a good goal.

"Not nearly as good business as keeping him for 5 months and finishing higher in the league as a result of having a better team. Even moving up to 7th to (potentially) qualify for the ECL would likely earn us more money, the degree to which we increase that amount of income skyrockets if we manage to get into 6 and again in 4th. 



Selling him was short sighted and was only ""good business"" if you believe that us not having him is not going to impact our results at all. Something that just clearly isn't true today after we had to play our record signing out of position because we just sold Jorginho despite already being short in midfield",Chelsea,Yes,j74z4y3,t1_j74uzmn

"Have to agree.  I hope for and expect a much better second half of the season, but with our terrible goal difference taken into account, making up 11 points on Newcastle and/or Man U as well as 8 points on Spurs seems fanciful.

"Fair enough. I like it - all part of the game for me, and one of the reasons why I like watching football. I like watching how players and coaching carry themselves both on and off the field, especially in cut-throat situations.

"Exactly! When Tuchel came in - in pretty much the same context as Potter - he took the bull by the balls and squeezed hard. Potter has been a limp dick... until now.

"I have a hard time believing these players are out of form, it seems more like they occasionally show up and over perform and we want to believe that‚Äôs their actual level. Tuchel for a very short stint had them playing at an extremely high level and we all convinced ourselves players like mount are a lot better then they actually are. Mendy another great example. That level eventually fell off last season and there has not been a sign that a single one of these players that are just out of form show any sign they can get it back and keep it.

We find all sorts of excuses to defend them instead of admitting they just aren‚Äôt good enough.

If they were, we would be a lot more competitive in the league over the last few year which demands a lot more consistency then a knockout tournament.",Chelsea,Yes,j75dfz0,t1_j75bhcr

"I don't think coming ahead of Spurs is a stretch at all especially if we beat them this month (like we should have with a much poorer team if we weren't robbed).

I think people get too caught up with what commentators are saying and we're actually playing this way most of the time. You just change between a 3 and a 4 depending on the phase of play and commentators lose their mind over it thinking we've changed our whole formation in game whilst we've actually just gone from defending to being in possession and so our formation looks different,Chelsea,Yes,j72aoci,t1_j725qdk

"Yes, Gallagher can definitely be a bit overzealous which is why I would prefer a midfield 3 as said above. In that midfield 3, I would definitely play Gallagher.

"Agree to disagree. A managers demeanour can set a tone, which is capable of filtering down towards the playing group, which then can be represented out on the pitch. 

The Ancelotti bit showcases that you aren't really familiar with him at all.

"No they aren't. At no point this season have we been unable to play a starting 11 full of starting 11 quality players, all in their preferred positions. All we've lost through injury is depth. There have been times where we've had these players but Potter has chosen not to use them, but that's his choice.



Throughout December last season we had an crisis that is incomparable to how easy we have it now. There were multiple games where we couldn't field a full bench, we have a game where we played a midfield 3 of Ziyech-RLC-Mount because that's all we had, we had games where all we had to put on the bench was two keepers and 3 CMs. We actually had impactful problems, where 3 midfielders were all out at the same time and then three defenders were all out at the same time etc. 


Whereas, this season we're having to play Cucurella instead of Chilwell compared to Sarr instead of Chilwell last season or Azpi instead of James, whereas last season we had to play CHO/Pulisic/RLC at RB instead of James etc. 



The injury ""crisis"" this season doesn't even remotely come close to how bad it was last season.",Chelsea,Yes,j75058c,t1_j74xngf

Meanwhile on social media, it was FFP yesterday and today the conversation is about 'What will happen if they all flop? How will Chelsea sell them on after signing them for 8.5 years? How will Chelsea deal with Enzo Fernandes earning 300k a week (yeh I saw this on Youtube today) if he flops?'

People are so desperate to want us to fail miserably that all the financial and tactical experts have already made up their minds about the new Chelsea even before the ball is kicked.

To know that there are always fans around you that have higher expectations (not dreams, or hopes, but minimum expectations) that will in turn help to drive the club forward feels amazing.



It feels like the sub is (relatively) full of Chelsea fans again. Glad to see that for most the right attitude is there again, even if it required 600m spent for some people to go back to embracing what it means to be Chelsea again. 



Hopefully this positive, demanding-results-at-all-cost attitude will remain when people are off of their transfer window high and back to playing football, even if things aren't going our way.

Theres a bunch of rumours on Italian football twitter about the Casadei transfer for the past couple of weeks.

I want to make it clear that there is no evidence that this is true and this is all speculation by Italian fans.

After Juventus got punished for improperly stating the value of their players, fans of other clubs looked at the 20m we paid to Inter for Casadei and think that it was suspiciously high compared to his perceived value.

I see speculation it was somehow related to the Lukaku transfer and something to do with overstating capital gains. It's pretty hard to figure out exactly what the allegations are using only google translate.

Just my thoughts... But if Chelsea don't win any cups this year, he can report this as a loss on his taxes.

"> My question to all of you, how many more signings until we are truly able to dominate the league for the next decade?

No amount will make you dominate for a decade. In fact it's not exactly a matter of quantity but quality. We can sign as many as we won't but if they don't click, we won't challenge for titles.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wjwm1,t1_j6widuk

It's a tricky situation",Chelsea,Yes,j6wzlyh,t1_j6wvhcq
"Keep him. He won't be injured forever and will be back one day to remind us how good he is. He may have to play less often when everyone's healthy, but he's still Kante, he's good enough to play here.",Chelsea,Yes,j6xq83p,t1_j6wvhcq
"Get rid of him. He's already half retired and we need to move on eventually, kicking the can down the road doesn't solve anything.",Chelsea,Yes,j6x3hae,t1_j6wvhcq
Matt law has said it‚Äôs considerably lower than Jorginho‚Äôs contract and I think Jorgi was on 150k/week? His deal is probably similar to Mudryks. Which is kind of nuts.

Mudryk: Would have a shout for starting in most of them. He definitely starts for Liverpool and Spurs. He'd battle it out for starting soots at Arsenal and City, and he'd have a shout at United if this Rashford form ends.

Felix: Has the quality to start at any of them, just depends if coaches would accomodate him

Badiashile: Would need to see more of him but I think he starts for Liverpool and Spurs, he'd be rotation at City, Arsenal and United. Wouldn't be surprised if he makes a case for starting in those teams though

Madueke/Fofana etc: Rotation/prospects

Gusto: Has a shout for starting for all of them",Chelsea,Yes,j6zj3k8,t1_j6yinli
"Enzo walks into any of them, Felix would depend on the formation they're playing but probably wouldn't struggle too much to do the same, Mudryk probably does the same but he's a bit more of an unknown at the highest level, Badiashile should be able to fight for a place with most of the current CB pairings in the league but would struggle to cement himself as most of the pairings are playing pretty well atm (he's only really managed to muscle in for us because Koulibaly's been awful). 

The young players (Santos, D. Fofana, etc) obviously don't. Madueke and Gusto would be depth options for most, though Gusto might start for United and would probably be playing for Liverpool rn given Trent's recent form.",Chelsea,Yes,j6zerfl,t1_j6yinli

"Here's a hot take - don't sell Maatsen. Chilwell has interest from City and if the fee is right, I would consider selling. His injury record is unfortunately horrendous and his wages are pretty big too I believe. Maatsen is currently playing an excellent season and his profile is similar to Chilwell's. This could be a risk but with Cucurella at the club and Chilwell injured so frequently, I don't even think it is. We can always look for another LB if Maatsen doesn't end up working out.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w1dvt,t1_j6vurhi

"I read this somewhere too, but there's so much talk about us having to choose only 2 of our new signings that I'm confused. If this is indeed the case, then clearly the club's goal of amassing a set of young players worked for us short-term too. 

Of those three, I think it's a no-brainer to leave Madueke out. Now that Ziyech is staying, I think he deserves a spot due to his form and attitude anyway - and we all know he gets motivated for the CL. Would like to see him play a key role in the CL. And anyway, this half season was going to be about settling in for Madueke - Sterling and Ziyech have that side covered for now. The other attackers are pretty much needed given the form of our existing alternatives.

Maybe Kubo, John David‚Äôs (any North Americans I‚Äôd be interested to hear how he is because he‚Äôs getting numbers) or someone.

"I think Tuchel earned the respect of players but maybe not as much love/devotion as the others (nor hate either, in the case of some under Jose and Conte).

He always seemed to put a calm, intelligent and methodical spin on things and rarely gave the media a chance to blow up a small story into a bigger one. 

My theory is that if we had the new sporting department in place in the summer things might have gone different with Tuchel. I don't think he respected Boehly enough to accept his ideas but at the same time he did not want to be directing recruitment either. He was probably pretty mad at the whirlwind changes leaving him to too much non-coaching work. In a presser he made a specific comment about Cech being a big loss. If there were some actual experts in the room at the time laying out the project to him then maybe he'd have bought in.

I would have never accepted Kante joining gooners. The thought of it scares me.,Chelsea,Yes,j6xw3pa,t1_j6wzlyh
"I'm ok keeping him around If he is willing to accept a smaller role in the club. Regardless of his current ability, he is still a positive personality in the dressing room and a large crop of young midfielders will see him as a legend and someone to learn from.",Chelsea,Yes,j6x8rcw,t1_j6x3hae
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that crazy tbh, playing in Portugal I don‚Äôt think the wages are that great. I remember when Utd signed Bruno he was only on 70k till they gave him a new deal last season.",Chelsea,Yes,j6y3kvj,t1_j6xio4v
"Makes sense, that puts him right on par with Mudryk financially. Loving this new wage structure.",Chelsea,Yes,j6yp1h0,t1_j6xig9x
"That's probably it. I think ¬£50m rising to ¬£57m was correct fee. They probably ignored the bonuses because complicated, leaving 50m over 5 seasons, or 10m per season. Half season is probably how they arrived at 5m.",Chelsea,Yes,j6zs7v2,t1_j6zgdzv
"Surely its Mudryk and Felix. We can manage with Silva Fofana and Chalobah, I can't bear a CL run where we have to start Pulisic Mount and Havertz every game",Chelsea,Yes,j6zhnvj,t1_j6zgdzv
"Not sure who I would pick between the two, but none of the players above are naturally left-footed CB‚Äôs like Badiashille.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wrkv6,t1_j6wnfyk

Koulibaly will still go regardless,Chelsea,Yes,j6wxfvn,t1_j6wucno
Oh I forgot about Willy,Chelsea,Yes,j6z1mak,t1_j6ysz2o
"Transfer windows are shit. People spend a month shitting on players that have given everything for us whilst fawning over the new shiny players (that they'll be shitting on in a month's time, whilst fawning over new shiny things that they want in summer). 



The best thing that's happened this window is what I've just said. The big spend seems to have shifted people focus away from excuses and towards winning as a minimum expectation. So, I'm very happy with it. 



You have to remember that we won the CL with Werner and Havertz up top, we won the Premier League with Moses etc. Winning is all about mentality, belief and commitment and that's why we're such a successful club. PSG and City have endless money and talent and yet they can only dream of having a trophy cabinet like ours. 



You can't buy winning mentality and it we had it in abundance at our club and were (and maybe still are) at risk of losing it and needing to slowly rebuild it again over many years. The change of tone from our fans after this transfer window and the clear drive from our owners to ensure they tried to buy the best of the best gives me hope that we can maintain that winning at all cost mentality. 


That's my positive comment about the transfer window.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wxvgn,t1_j6ww68e
"Well lets discuss pogba then =)

Enzo was sold for 10m-18m plus 25% so actually 42,5m",Chelsea,Yes,j6w90wg,t1_j6w2wc4
I mean he'll be our cunt then.,Chelsea,Yes,j6xvanx,t1_j6xkwwk
Guess we will see Mount/Gallagher. Terrible pivot. I dont care as I know our injuries and signings cant play. just cant be asked for more banter from friends and rival fans if we lose,Chelsea,Yes,j6y23vw,t1_j6y1ov1

"We can only have so many players. We're not gonna put youth for youth's sake. Already have 2 leftbacks, Conor imo simply isn't good enough and Trevoh because I don't see the other centrebacks leaving.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wtddb,t1_j6w3m05
">Also, calm down with prices.

Imo most of them are realistic. Interested to know which ones you don't find possible. 

Azpi HAS to leave. It's over, he shouldn't have been at the club this season too.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wt9lp,t1_j6w4cb9
"Think it's a bit too premature to be thinking this. If Chilwell is fit and does well for the rest of the season, then we'd be foolish to sell, to a rival especially. He's a far more complete option at LB than Cucurella, and can play both LB+LWB - so if anything we should be looking to sell Cucurella if he's the more limited player. I believe Colwill will be in the squad next season onwards, and he can easily play the more reserved LB role that Cucurella plays. 

Either way, provided Chilwell ends the season well I'd easily postpone this decision for another year. Think the ownership can convince Maatsen to extend his contract and go out on another loan/worst case sale with buy-back. I reckon Barca may be interested in Cucurella eventually, maybe even Atletico.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w2dh3,t1_j6w1dvt
"This isn't even a hot take. I was gonna say it myself. Had a discussion about this with someone else on the subreddit the other day. 

The only reason I think we might make an easier profit because of 0 amortization. We can obviously make a higher profit still but It fully depends on how much City offer. Even if they give us ¬£40m, Maatsen arguably would earn us a higher profit.. I feel like the ownership might look into that direction. Potentially charging Burnley a premium as they're destined for promotion.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wtpv4,t1_j6w1dvt
"Yeah and Ziyech apparently ¬£15m or ‚Ç¨20m, hence the ¬£50m..",Chelsea,Yes,j6vvqgc,t1_j6vvo69

Thank you. I‚Äôll try them both,Chelsea,Yes,j72w7nw,t1_j70ufuv
My comment still applies. It's much better to be optimistic and excited than pessimistic and looking at the negative side all the time. There is a line between optimism and realism I'd add though,Chelsea,Yes,j6wgdlc,t1_j6wfasm
I‚Äôm definitely optimistic about the signings but I do also hate how this subs adopted a policy of ‚Äúu can‚Äôt critique Boehly. You can‚Äôt critique our investment policy‚Äù,Chelsea,Yes,j6wfffs,t1_j6wfasm
Seems particularly unhinged today.,Chelsea,Yes,j6wu54g,t1_j6wqvm3
Are people going to stop idiotically praising ownership and defending a pattern of bad decision making while being distracted by shiny new signs most we haven‚Äôt even seen play yet?,Chelsea,Yes,j6wr7zp,t1_j6wqvm3
"Wtf are you taking about are out here defending the Ziyech shit all overt the place. Get your head out of your ass.

"Thanks, how early should i arrive to have space?",Chelsea,Yes,j6vyxt8,t1_j6vv7sc
"I think we‚Äôll probably know that Bellingham is out of reach because of the amortisation loophole being closed (Bellingham is probably going to go for more than ¬£120m)

there was none because Conor straight up refused to entertain that transfer,Chelsea,Yes,j6zbrhe,t1_j6zaphm

‚ÄòChelsea found a loophole to register unlimited signings‚Äô they said. 
I agree with waht you said, also.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wnrga,t1_j6wnlxt
[deleted],Chelsea,Yes,j6wcxay,t1_j6w99xz
"I really like the idea of signing Roque and giving him the backup striker role. Every time we signed a striker to play ahead of Havertz we just came back to him anyway. I'd rather see whether he can work with better players around him that complement how a false 9 plays - so far he hasn't had that. Roque could be eased in behind him and actually be given meaningful minutes in cup games.

He'd easily be better than Aubameyang, so that's a squad upgrade too. And if Havertz still doesn't work out, we can go back for a starting striker or, if Roque has developed well until then, even hand him that role.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wbfmw,t1_j6wam81
"Agreed. Anyone expecting an all action CM might be a bit disappointed, but he‚Äôll make a massive difference to how we get up the pitch. Can‚Äôt see him stacking goals and assists but that‚Äôs not why we signed him.",Chelsea,Yes,j6we4d0,t1_j6w9r4p
"We can remove Jorgi, right?",Chelsea,Yes,j6wjiqg,t1_j6wipbk
"It sends a sickening message to women . Its the same with Arsenal and Partey . One of the worst things is the girls father took Greenwoods side . It‚Äôs obvious she was pressured into dropping her statement, Greenwood even broke a court order to stay away and contacted her. Now they are allegedly engaged . It‚Äôs like Stockholm Syndrome .",Chelsea,Yes,j6xbwa3,t1_j6xb42d
"Agreed but unfortunately for him that's a position we've got plenty of cover in. For the remainder of the Champions League we'll still have Silva, Koulibaly, Fofana and Chalobah for centre back positions.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w1u7k,t1_j6w11wy
I know I meant why is it limited to three.,Chelsea,Yes,j6w5n9y,t1_j6w1vz2
"Very much doubt. Mendy is still out with injury. We can't risk having just one fit senior GK.

EDIT: It will probably be Chukwuemeka",Chelsea,Yes,j6w2enq,t1_j6w29y3

"Last time I checked we were 10th in the Premier league and playing absolutely terribly. Were in no position to compete at the top level, since Potter still has no idea what our team is supposed to actually look like, especially now we've added another ‚Ç¨350 million worth of players, so we may as well take the opportunity to try and figure that out.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w4aux,t1_j6w3pn1
"There's no reason for him to be here, so we may as well recognise that and act like he's not",Chelsea,Yes,j6w4ftr,t1_j6w48bg

"No amount of winning mentality is going to overcome the amount of dross we've had in our squad for the last 6 - 7 seasons. The single Champions League we got in 2021 is not representative of how good we've been as a club since 2017, did you realise that? We overachieved massively. And whilst it was wonderful winning it, it has also massively damaged expectations of where we were and are as a club. 

Domestically we've been practically irrelevant since Conte and have had the odd cup run here and there. That's it. The Europa League was nice but is just a box ticking exercise and reflects the failure of Conte's last season. People would laugh at Wenger's Arsenal for getting top 4 year on year under him but that's basically how we were for the majority of a decade whilst spending ridiculous amounts of money.

You need to accept that the club was stagnant and there was no better time to rebuild the club.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wznze,t1_j6wxvgn
Hall will probably play,Chelsea,Yes,j6y6np0,t1_j6y23vw
There is a ticket exchange as well that you can check out - members who can‚Äôt attend will list tickets there. Maybe check that out?,Chelsea,Yes,j6yb9lo,t1_j6ya5sl
"Yeah no, there's no scenario where we should sell Cucurella because Colwill, a CB, can fill in at LB when Chilwell, who's been non-stop injured for a long time, is injured. In reality, we'd just end up regularly lining up with a CB out of position at LB. 

Cucurella also isn't playing like a CB at LB, that's not giving him enough credit. He hasn't been great for us but Potter has hinted at various reasons (health, family issues), and there's a reason why City wanted him. He was good for Brighton under Potter. Would be crazy to sell him.

As for Chilwell being able to play LB + LWB, so is Maatsen. The main differences are that Maatsen is younger and can stay fit.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w4sk2,t1_j6w2dh3
Annoying couldnt get them out earlier for more,Chelsea,Yes,j6vvsbo,t1_j6vvqgc

That's not even my comment is it. I've seen some people literally bemoan anything to do with our signings. It's a genuine question. How can you support a club if you're not excited for the players they've signed to play. It's baffling to me.,Chelsea,Yes,j6wga4i,t1_j6wfffs
"Meds, now",Chelsea,Yes,j6wr9ue,t1_j6wr7zp

My point was that we'd sell Cucurella eventually and replace him with Maatsen. As early as next summer. So we'd then have 2 LBs, with Colwill being able to fulfill a deeper role as well. The only aspect in which Cucurella is better than Chilwell at for me is his willingness and ability to play the ball in between the lines during build-up. Colwill is also excellent at that, and when Potter came in initially he seemed to want the left-back to play that kind of deeper/passing centric role with the right-back bombing up (he didn't change this even when Chilwell, a more offensive LB, or when Azpi, a more defensive RB, came into the team).

As for City wanting Cucurella, they wanted him for 35-40m. Not to mention that they also wanted a few players in the past who would've been ill-suited to them, that they dodged due to rivals. He'd have been fine, but likely not nearly as good as the best LBs around.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w51t1,t1_j6w4sk2

"Definitely realism but support at least. I've seen people trash a player who hasn't even set foot on the pitch. I don't even think it's right to trash any player who plays for the club full stop. Skepticism is fine. Having no expectations is fine. What I find annoying is negativity and writing off new signings almost entirely. There's skepticism and there's being a know it all. No one knows how the signings are going to pan out. Though blind optimism is bad, I think that is better than full on negativity and acting like one knows how it's going to pan out. Trying to look at the bright side is much preferable to me but maybe life philosophies.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wiimg,t1_j6whch0
"U can support a club and not be excited for their signings very easily. I think if your club signs a player then u shouldn‚Äôt go as far as to insult the actual player, but this narrative that we have to completely get behind anything Chelsea does or we‚Äôre not real fans is just ridiculous. The fact is, the transfer policy that we have adopted is very risky and parallels can easily be drawn between the players we‚Äôve brought in and historic major PL flops. If fans want to talk about the potential downsides, then that doesn‚Äôt mean that they aren‚Äôt fans. U can love the club enough to critique it.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wgzpr,t1_j6wga4i

"Well, that's a headscratcher then. So we can de-register one player? 

I really wouldn't want to do it, but if we have to I'd de-register Pulisic. Would suck for him but he is kinda surplus. Mudryk, Felix and Enzo would be my three as Fofana will be back to play in defence anyway (gets tricky rotating CBs though so would effectively mean Badiashile doesn't play a lot in PL bar injuries).",Chelsea,Yes,j6wouyp,t1_j6wo64e

"Down the road I‚Äôd assume that outgoing would cover it, but your talking about spending at least another 300 million. The idea about having the strongest possible team is probably accurate, but it‚Äôs just a question of practicality with would the board be willing to spend that much money without the long contracts? I‚Äôd imagine this window was basically just our rebuild being mostly done in one foul swoop and moving forward we‚Äôll spend like any other big team.

Yeah. I definitely agree with the last point. I mean I'm not saying they aren't fans. I understand criticism about certain decisions the club takes and the strategy. The major thing is if you're constantly negative about the club and everything around it. What's the point? Isn't supporting a club meant to be something that brings you joy?

"Is it your first football manager game? There's a bunch of things I've learned through playing the series over 25 years that are of obvious benefit, I imagine it's pretty daunting going in blind.

First things I'd suggest, to make things easier:

- download some tactics. There's a guy with the name Knap that posts on sigames forum, Google Knap sigames tactics and you should find a link to a bunch of proven tactics that make things miles easier.

- on the responsibilities tabs in game, let your assistants do all the press conferences, delegate responsibility for everything except first team contracts. Makes it miles more streamlined.

- whilst there's loads of information and options in game available, you can safely ignore most of it. Analytics, training etc. can all be skipped.

The core gameplay loop once you've done the above is simply going match to match, selecting your team and delivering team talks. Of course you can tweak instructions mid game. Between games, read the news if you want, deal with any player related issues as they come up. In the summer and winter set a few days aside for contract renewals, and use the scouting tab to find players you want to sign. At the start of the season (1st September) you'll need to register your PL and CL squads.

There will be an extensive database update mid-late Feb with all the January transfers added to the game, so you might want to wait til then if you want to play as current Chelsea.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wgyxv,t1_j6wa9uz

When you're in a competitive environment you always need to aim higher and try to innovate and push your opposition. Resting on your laurels will only lead to downfall when there are a handful of clubs aiming to take your perch.

Wouldn't be surprised if that's also a big cause of our mentality issues, it's hard for players to feel motivated when the club doesn't appear to be pushing to win trophies.

"Discussion about Liverpool's latest losses

Here is a comment i wrote in one of Tifo's videos about Liverpool: 

""The true loss of this Liverpool's side is honestly Henderson. When we were in our hay day he was the silent engine in our team, helping Salah up front, covering for Trent when there's a counter attack and overrall his workrate is what made him great. Now, he is just past his prime and we see the effects of that on our team, Salah isolated, Trent getting butchured alive in that right flank .. etc. That's why i'm convinced if we find some midfielders with very high workrate and intensity, we will get back to the competition, but we didn't in the transfer market this january so the blame will land of FSG .. greedy people.""

That aside, i think the system we play currently isn't effective when the midfield is lacking that press, so basically we are playing against ourselves with our current system .. that's why we are conceding so many goals.",Liverpool,No,j7bpf3s,t3_10u5d54

"So I just rewatched the 3 goals and here's my take.

Goal 1:  Gomez gets pulled out of position.  Robbo fills in at CB.  Robbo sees Gomez getting back into position and slides back to LB prematurely leaving a big hole.  Matip slides over as cover.  Makes of a mess of it.  OG Matip.  Big picture, I'd say this falls on Robbo and Matip.  Robbo didn't wait for Gomez to fill in and Matip made a mess of a fairly simple defensive phase.

Goal 2:  This one's a big mess frankly.  Under hit free kick lands Acuna, who Robbo is marking.  The ball rolls to the end line and rather than Robbo follow the ball and man, he elects to fall back into his zone.  Baj and Nunez are also out of position at this point where they find themselves outside the 18 yard box despite everyone else being in it.  Both make moves to fill in but Baj ends up in no-mans land to some degree.  Keita attempts to challenge the ball but is not able to get there in time.  It's a fairly shit cross right to Gomez's head.  He elects to head it back into play rather than out of play.  Ali also gets pulled out by this cross.  Miscommunication?  Hard to say, but Ali is now way off his line and scrambling.  The ball bounces around just outside the goal and Dawson goes to the ball, while Trent, who has man marked Dawson this entire set pieces, decides at this moment to run away from Dawson to try to end up at the near post, but not actually near it.  Dawson ends up burying it.

This goal is really annoying because so many little things were done wrong.  Robbo didn't go to the ball, but you could blame that on Baj and Nunez not being in good positions.  Gomez not putting the ball out or letting Ali take it could be down to bad communication.  But in the end, I'm going to have to blame Trent for this one.  Once again, his defensive instincts let him down.  If he stays with his man and does his job, he puts a tackle or block on Dawson.

Goal 3:  Problem #1 is Gomez and Baj losing the ball cheaply.  But it's 70 yards from goal so while many will go on about that, I have a problem blaming players losing the ball 70 yards from goal for conceding.  For me, this goal is on Thiago.  He's the deepest midfield player.  He has 20 yards on Neves, who is not exactly a speedster, but Thiago doesn't get back, doesn't cut the angle for the pass, and allows Neves to make a simple run for an easy goal.  All Neves did was run hard.  We made it easy for him.

I'm sure many won't agree with my analysis.  Most will want to blame Gomez, and don't get me wrong, he's not playing well at all, but if I had to point the finger for each goal, I'd go with Robbo, Trent, and Thiago.",Liverpool,No,j7ad30r,t3_10u5d54

Now who's doing taking the leader role? Salahs personality isn't that type, Robbo is probably not taken too serious because he's a jester off field. Ali is the only one that I see shouting at players, but even he is too polite.

Just look at the team, whos a leader there... Nunez is still the new kid and is dealing with his internal demons, Keita is very shy, Tiago is love plus looses possession so much he probably thinks he better keep quiet, whos left... Matip? Lol.

It's supposed to be entertaining and fun even though the more tribal fans want us all to act like we're in a big multi-chapter motorcycle gang.

Which results in subpar performances which further confirm the futility of the challenge to City. 

Other teams haven't been subject to the depression Liverpool have fallen into as no-one else was realistically expecting to challenge City for the title anyway this season - the other top team's goal was for the other 2 or 3 CL spots that would be up for grabs. Had Liverpool started the season with the goal being ""top 4"" it would have been admitting defeat from the off, but the alternative would be to believe they could overtake a City side that now had Haaland.

"That could genuinely be the first time in a while the players get booed off the pitch by their own supporters in many years. I don't even remember the last time it happened to us, must have been before the 2013-14 season",Liverpool,Yes,j7ae3l7,t1_j7acopu
"If Klopp leaves we‚Äôll be like Everton within two years. It‚Äôs back to mid tier managers, mid tier players, and being irrelevant by December.",Liverpool,Yes,j7baazt,t1_j7b96pw
"Most managers don't last half a season of bad results, so it's totally normal for people to assume the end is near. How many managers are afforded the time to rebuild a second time?

I'm absolutely for giving Klopp that opportunity, I think he's capable of pulling it off, and reckon it's only rarely happened before because of owner and fan impatience resulting in premature sackings.

But we're going to hear a lot of noise from rival fans and the media that the writing is on the wall etc because that's how these things usually go.",Liverpool,Yes,j7babsn,t1_j7b96pw

"Give him some time, he's only 22. In a few years he'll learn the offside rule. Then in a few more years, he'll learn how to score a goal after taking a touch. Perhaps by the time he's in his mid 30s, the club will finally get their finished product.",Liverpool,Yes,j7a9g5b,t1_j7a8ywm

Henderson was averaging something like 22 games per season since 2014 and suddenly he‚Äôs played 35 plus cup games. No wonder he looks like he‚Äôs aged 5 years over night.

2 central midfielders need to be brought in. Then it should be reassessed again in Jan.",Liverpool,Yes,j7asxp8,t1_j7aqpaa

"Was saying this yesterday. Everyone is in the dark. It was mixed signals from the get go with reliable sources saying they wanted the club sold, and then them saying it's a partial sale. Even if that's to save ""face"" for offers, the silence is awful.

He had the highest non penalty conversion rate of any forward in top 5 European leagues last season with 30.8%. You don‚Äôt just go from that to 5.8% this season and not bounce back a bit. It‚Äôll even itself out. Finishing is kind of random like that",Liverpool,Yes,j7bpgso,t1_j7bk6b9

Klopp can only try motivate them so much before they need to take things into their own hands and get their heads out of their asses and put in a proper shift.

One thing about Henderson, he may not have been the best, but he was always running and motivating, yelling encouragement on the pitch  and that seems gone now. Even when he‚Äôs playing, it doesn‚Äôt seem like they‚Äôre doing any of that anymore. It doesn‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre backing each other, celebrating small things. When goals are scored, they don‚Äôt even celebrate in an excited way. That goal against wolves that Nunez scored was so incredible but everyone half-heartedly jogged to him.

Even Leicester had to chuck the goal in their own net twice to give us a chance.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aghcf,t1_j7a9den
Nothing changes imo.,Liverpool,Yes,j7a9icn,t1_j7a9den
"That first season we finished top 4 with Klopp. We finished the season playing a diamond with Studge up top and dragged ourselves over the finish line (with a world class Coutinho no less).

I think something like this, grit and system change, to drag ourselves to an acceptable position. 

It‚Äôll take passun, which is difficult when half the squad are aging and winners.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ahn3r,t1_j7a9den
"That came from Indy, who always seems to find a scoop whenever Liverpool fans are especially desperate for progressive news.",Liverpool,Yes,j7agl13,t1_j7afxt6

"He has realised who the impostor is, getting the airlock ready.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ak9jt,t1_j7afxt6

"Lol when Klopp essentially did this, he was being crucified by posters here.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b3y5i,t1_j7b3f6b
Looks like it. He might get it wrong sometimes but I like how baldy isn‚Äôt afraid to change things up and experiment with formations/tactics. I wish we would do the same smh.,Liverpool,Yes,j7biokt,t1_j7bi2xi
"Okay I went and checked the heatmaps from the 2018 season they all are more or less similar so I don't get your overall point, perhaps he is cutting in more from right than usual but that can be due to his role being more tailored to the teams needs over the years and diminishing returns from him as he is in his 30s, can't expect the same influence he had on the game like he used to do earlier.

But he has plenty of presence in the box still and isn't totally isolated on the right. Also you are looking at the heat map of half a season and comparing it to a full season, but still I don't see any drastic difference in tactics or instructions.

Case In point 2019-2020 season

Yeah but the local fan groups aren't gonna protest and will only be condescending if people from outside of Liverpool talk about doing it lol,Liverpool,Yes,j7ar050,t1_j7ap5w5
"Protest for what? Jesus Christ honestly there‚Äôs a reason people don‚Äôt like plastics.

It‚Äôs been made clear the club is in one way or another up for sale. What is protesting going to do? Believe it or not locally we have a lot more going on than protesting billionaire owners of a football club, this week we saw on of the biggest strikes/protests in the city for years for better pay and work conditions, we‚Äôve had the nurses, paramedics all doing the same over the past few weeks. There is more to life and more to the city than the football club right now, people can‚Äôt afford to eat due to soaring coast of living and stagnated salaries. 

But fuck it all scousers will protest so Chad from Milwaukee can have a better Liverpool team on fifa next season. 

This sub pretends to be part of some magical/ mythical Scouse ethos, and to be fair a small number of really try, but the majority of you haven‚Äôt got a clue. 

I think I need to tap out of here for a while it‚Äôs tiring at times.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ate6c,t1_j7ap5w5
"Wish I had your optimism man, but I can't see where our next goal comes from, let alone win.

Hopefully Everton do Everton derby things and gift us a win in hilariously absurd circumstances and we kick on from there.",Liverpool,Yes,j7auge9,t1_j7ajrx5

"I would say the same for the LCM too, Gini used to help robbo and have the legs to press hard",Liverpool,Yes,j7bpxqk,t1_j7bpf3s
"The problem with going 4-4-2 you need the two mids to be physically really good for various reasons and Thiago and Bajcetic aren't exactly good physically especially when you look at Evertons midfield of Doucoure, Onana and Guye we'd get overan even more than in a 4-3-3",Liverpool,Yes,j7cbn8i,t1_j7ca3i8
I do agree he should be dropped and sold in the summer but there was a time at the start of the 18/19 season where he was unplayable. Him and VVD couldn‚Äôt be beaten so there‚Äôs clearly a top class player in there but it seems that injuries have ruined him,Liverpool,Yes,j7agmzw,t1_j7ag151
"His strength is one on one defending. So during 2018-2020, our midfield was strong and not much passed through the middle, only passes played were long balls to isolated attackers. Gomez was good as dealing with those situations. But when the midfield is open and things are moving in front of him, he gets lost. He can‚Äôt read the game, cannot hold the offside line and totally gets lost. I still want him around as a 4th choice defender and a back up at the right back position. He also takes up a homegrown spot. But we should not expect much from him.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aiz46,t1_j7ag151
Seems like a mentality issue with him. He has all the attributes and quality to be a top defender. But yeah he should be dropped.,Liverpool,Yes,j7agg23,t1_j7ag151
The lads home grown and 4th choice he‚Äôs perfectly fine at what he does.,Liverpool,Yes,j7avqd8,t1_j7ag151
"He's a home-grown player, so sadly his worth to the club is not only determined by his playing skills.",Liverpool,Yes,j7al7b8,t1_j7ag151
Generalising the sub as FSG supporters is a massive exaggeration but they definitely exist. A lot quieter over the last week or two tho,Liverpool,Yes,j7ak80g,t1_j7ajysw
"Loads on this sub defend them constantly. The current tack is to blame Klopp for everything including transfers, fitness and the staff leaving. It's usually the same 5-10 people.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b7avr,t1_j7ajysw

Think you're forgetting someone",Liverpool,Yes,j7c10s6,t1_j7bzhcs
"It genuinely becomes a less crazy shout with each passing game. Salah isn't even doing the basics right at the moment. He doesn't win a single individual battle against opposition players anymore, he can't shoot, can barely pass, can't hold a ball up.

What do we genuinely have to lose by playing Doak?",Liverpool,Yes,j7d0wl7,t1_j7czngv
Spoiler alert: they won‚Äôt.,Liverpool,Yes,j7bhlho,t1_j7bgq26
"The Qatari wealth fund paid off Trump and afghan officials to basically step aside and let the Taliban have Afghanistan.

Not Arab enough to care about mate,Liverpool,Yes,j7cax1s,t1_j7bgq26
"It‚Äôs not physical fatigue they‚Äôve had long periods of rest now and mental fatigue is something the club should be treating with sports psychologists anyways, neither are valid excuses.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aky0m,t1_j7ak28j
"How do they fix it? I understand it‚Äôs been really hard after missing out on the quad but they‚Äôre professional athletes. They need to take it into their own hands at some point and just dig in, put in a messy shift for 90 mins and just grind out a proper proper result. So many of them aren‚Äôt going in for tackles, losing the ball, waiting for passes to come to them instead of meeting them, letting them be intercepted. Maybe Klopp is being stubborn with tactics but the players aren‚Äôt trying either. How long can they blame the hangover for last season? It‚Äôs deeper than that now",Liverpool,Yes,j7akt1b,t1_j7ak28j
"Don‚Äôt be excited mate, a RedBird minority investment is looming large to finish us completely.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b7vro,t1_j7b6tc4
"Mid-table wouldn‚Äôt even be the biggest factor, it‚Äôll be whether or not Fsg is still at the helm when the time comes. Realistically is your Bellingham would you rather join City who will definitely be doing a massive rebuild or Liverpool who‚Äôs owners are notorious penny pinchers",Liverpool,Yes,j7axv08,t1_j7awk9u

"Anyone will go anywhere if the money is right.

Also, every fanbase is myopic. Its why they are called fanatics",Liverpool,Yes,j7ay3vi,t1_j7awk9u
you don't think Gomez leaving his position like a headless chicken was the main factor that lead to goal 1 ???,Liverpool,Yes,j7ae9s6,t1_j7ad30r
Pure and utter delusion to point the finger at anyone but Gomez for their 2nd goal. He's just a completely brain-dead footballer that would be in the Championship by now if he didn't get lucky with VVD hand holding him for the last few years.,Liverpool,Yes,j7afb2y,t1_j7ad30r
"Fair points across the board but there is absolutely no way the blame for that second goal should lie anywhere but Gomez.

You talk about Trent's defensive instincts but in that second where Gomez has to make a decision he makes the wrong one. It's got nothing to do with communication. Noone needs to be telling him anything. It's at most the second phase of play of an attacking freekick, he knows for a fact there are going to be Wolves players in the middle of the area - even if he can't see them. It shouldn't even come into his mind to make the decision he did, yet here we are.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aerk2,t1_j7ad30r
"In reality Matip, Thiago, Bajcetic, Gakpo, Robertson, all had hideous games yesterday. Gomez was fine, actually trying to play like a Liverpool player attacking the game when he could, defending with guts, but he's a whipping boy on this sub because people stan Matip and latch on to English players to hate. Good comment.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ahx9k,t1_j7ad30r
All depends on the how they sell it to him if they are selling it as you are going to have the team rebuilt around him I think yes,Liverpool,Yes,j7avjqq,t1_j7aumsn
"No obviously not. Joining perennial underdogs and what ifs, where you're expected to carry the team week in-week out, where your legs are run into the ground because you don't have competent back ups, and where a couple of weeks of bad form due to all of these factors means that the club journos and fan groups are instructed to write articles about how you have no desire and you can't escape criticism from what ultimately stems from mismanagement at the top.",Liverpool,Yes,j7axfeh,t1_j7aumsn
"No way, with our current squad, owners situation, ambitions showed by owners AND fans. And when RM and ManCity is interested too, with better situation at every department, and better paycheck.",Liverpool,Yes,j7avcz8,t1_j7aumsn
"IMO they are selling that the next rebuild will be building the team around him, basically giving him the keys to the castle. Much like City is rebuilding around Haaland (changed systems pep has used for years to suit him etc). Certain guarantees of investment in the squad as well so it‚Äôs not him along with 5 aging/ subpar midfielders and he‚Äôs expecting to make magic. Future captain, legacy, ‚Äúthis means more‚Äù, Klopp etc 

I think even if this season was going the way it is, it wouldn‚Äôt have stopped him. However, the turmoil BTS is a massive red flag. I think his family are likely looking at it (including how toxic the fanbase has become) and have decided it‚Äôs too risky for his future. BTS is too shaky, obviously a big mess with ward and Graham leaving, all the rumours of unrest between members of the coaching staff etc, the owners. They wouldn‚Äôt want to risk his development. 

Unfortunately I think the ship has sailed because of it.",Liverpool,Yes,j7awul9,t1_j7aumsn

Both Klopp and Bellingham deserve better than this club",Liverpool,Yes,j7b9fi1,t1_j7aumsn

Just come out and speak and be honest then. That‚Äôs what annoys me. Klopps in a position only a couple managers have ever been in where as bad as it gets the fans would never want him out. Which makes him more powerful than the owners. So why not come out and be honest about the state of the squad?,Liverpool,Yes,j7b0dcc,t1_j7ayokq
"Gakpo played really well yesterday, looked much better on the left wing than through the center. Obviously, the bar is pretty low for the team at the moment, but he was one of the few bright sparks for the start of the second half",Liverpool,Yes,j7a8z4h,t1_j7a5mh9

"you seem like a bad football expert haha you can see CLEARLY that it is not about not following his tactics, its about football intelligence and things like running, effort.

"I despise Man City and Haaland, but seriously he has fucking 25 in 20. He has not made them worse.

That's before you even look at the fact Jesus has fallen off

EDIT: Carragher, the wank, agrees with you to be fair:

'City are lesser team with Haaland in'
FT: Spurs 1-0 Man City

Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher: ""Manchester City now, not because of Erling Haaland, we can see they‚Äôre a different team but, they‚Äôve scored exactly the same amount of goals.

""He‚Äôs scored 25 Premier League goals, but Manchester City as a team have still scored the same amount of goals, but they‚Äôve conceded more goals. It‚Äôs far easier to counter-attack them as well, so they‚Äôre a different team and a lesser team with Erling Haaland in the team, but it‚Äôs not his fault.

""We‚Äôre not seeing the full package of what this player can do because of the team he has gone to.""",Liverpool,Yes,j7c5g6n,t1_j7c4yiv
Errr what ü§£,Liverpool,Yes,j7da95p,t1_j7d8inv
Disagree I think his movement is brilliant and his linkup play is clearly far better than Mo or Darwin‚Äôs. I think he‚Äôs a nice backup for Diaz and when he has an actual team around him he‚Äôll start scoring,Liverpool,Yes,j7afaxo,t1_j7acvgr
I don‚Äôt get this. The kids not ready. Normal Klopp treatment.,Liverpool,Yes,j7afvxb,t1_j7af1rj
"Halaaand has scored over 20 goals, think it‚Äôs more the fact they‚Äôve got a centre back pairing of Nathan Ake and akanji tbf if Nunez scored the amount halaand has we wouldn‚Äôt be as shit as we are",Liverpool,Yes,j7c7lfv,t1_j7c6pp8
"I think people idealize gulf ownership as it‚Äôll bring money, new signings, etc‚Ä¶ but people seem to be blinded by the fact there are some serious human rights allegations against them.

Nobody‚Äôs on a moral high ground in this day and age.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ax8r8,t1_j7avsik
"I'd take Qatari owners over these vulture fund capitalists that are destroying the club...

Forget about your romantic notion of a modern socialist football club. It won't ever happen. That dream died long ago. We are living in the era of late stage capitalism where everything is tied to profit..

You don't like what modern football has become then stop following the premier league.

Just give us the Qataris over these penny pinchers we have at the helm. I don't want this club to go through another thirty years in the wilderness. Once he leaves, we won't ever find another saviour like Klopp...

Wake up people. Questionable foreign ownership is inevitable so why wait?",Liverpool,Yes,j7b976r,t1_j7avsik
What Qatari ownership? When did people start taking rumours on twitter as facts. What's your opinion about the latest rumours that Red bird might be interested in buying more Liverpool shares?,Liverpool,Yes,j7awunp,t1_j7avsik

Gakpo did well yesterday. There were other problems other than him yesterday.,Liverpool,Yes,j7bg6vo,t1_j7bekbi
Gakpo should be miles ahead of Ox on the pecking order. Klopp‚Äôs loyalty to Robbo when Kostas has performed time and time again is just absurd.,Liverpool,Yes,j7bh3yz,t1_j7bekbi

 A consortium of sorts with more ambition/care about the club would be fine. But that just my opinion.",Liverpool,Yes,j7acusb,t1_j7acrad

He makes a lot of mistakes and was a massive downgrade",Liverpool,Yes,j7bc8sn,t1_j7b6ku8

- Everyone wanted City to win over us to ‚Äúsave football‚Äù, including Arsenal fans. 

- Arsenal fans are unbearable even when they‚Äôre shit, so imagine if they win the PL. 

- I don‚Äôt want any Arteta-Klopp comparison. 

- City winning means nothing to no one. 

- My City-supporting friend hasn‚Äôt bantered me once despite our form. Complete opposite of my Arsenal-supporting friends.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bankn,t1_j7b62xn
"City. Besides their title wins meaning nothing and everybody knows it, I'd also just like another team in this era to experience being top at Christmas, leading the title race relentlessly, only to miss out to City by a point.

"Mane wanted to leave. Why do people keep acting as if he didn‚Äôt want out?

"Man√© wanted to leave, why would we keep the player that wants to leave? Also let‚Äôs not act like Man√© hasn‚Äôt declined, he‚Äôs been poor by his standards for Bayern. That period after AFCON was just a purple patch 

If you‚Äôre going to use stats then don‚Äôt lie to suit your agenda. Jesus has 5 goals in all comps, Nunez has 10. Idk how you can say we didn‚Äôt replace Man√©, we replaced him with Diaz who ended up being so good that he forced Man√© out the left wing position.

The rest of your points are valid",Liverpool,Yes,j7afzjy,t1_j7af7za
"It's just this sub you're talking about, which operates more by the rules of an online fandom than a football support. 

Players like Nunez, Matip, Keita, get latched on to like kooky side characters in an anime or off-meta heroes in a videogame, because that's the cultural context for the mainstream of opinion on the sub, that's the shared experience of cultural value and pleasure people are coming from, much more so than from football itself. 

So don't worry about it. It's not like the fans here are going down Anfield and booing every time Henderson touches the ball while singing songs demanding that Keita is made captain and given a role as playmaker. Maybe they would if they went to a game but they don't do they?

It's all very abstract. So don't worry about it. People are stanning their favourite characters for clout and memes, not making informed arguments about the value of this or that player to this or that system. 

Your post is the same, ranting about goals, creativity and assists from midfield. Like, in the real world everyone knows we don't play that way. It doesn't matter who the midfielders are, they are there to play key passes not get assists. When a player does get played in midfield and gets a couple of goals and creates, in Harvey Elliott, the Thiago stans in here have to attack him because it makes their hero look bad.

So it's just an abstract, otherworldly internet opinion about internet arguments that also don't really connect directly with reality. So there's no use getting all spiteful about it, it is what it is. When it's not fun to be here, just don't be.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ah57t,t1_j7af7za

Do you follow the Italian league? Even when he was banging goals he gets so much hate and now he‚Äôs not doing amazing they hate him even more. Nunez will be fine. It‚Äôs not his fault he‚Äôs come into this team at the moment. This isn‚Äôt what he signed up for.

"It‚Äôs really interesting watching the narrative around Sadio change now because 20/21 and the first half of 21/22 there was people claiming he‚Äôs finished and he looked like he couldn‚Äôt beat a man at all. A lot of calls for him to be sold I remember. He even came out himself and said he had no idea whats happened to him and had numerous tests done to figure it out 

He came back from the AFCON alot better and I think the new role as a centre forward helped but still wasn‚Äôt peak Mane which is understandable. Ultimately he wanted one last challenge at Bayern and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything we could‚Äôve done to change his mind. He gave his all for us and I think it‚Äôs safe to say we got his best years",Liverpool,Yes,j7aiiab,t1_j7ai2y9

"In 2019 - A forward to rotate with the front 3 as neither Shaq nor Divock were capable of doing so ; A creative midfielder to add a new dimension to our team ; Back ups for Trent and Robbo  

In 2020 - A CB to replace Lovren then whatever position we didn't strenghten the year before.

In 2021 - Fresh legs in midfield as Thiago is injury prone, Milner is ancient, Hendo is aging, Naby and Ox are clearly unreliable. Maybe a new forward to try and shift the underperforming Mane and Firmino.

Funny thing is that we are truly Next Summer FC if you look at the list I made and compare it to our transfer business

Edit: Obviously didn't include this summer because I'd rather not talk about it",Liverpool,Yes,j7bfoup,t1_j7badeg
Marko Gruijic and Luis Alberto,Liverpool,Yes,j7bblur,t1_j7badeg
"2019 - Get a RB to rotate for TAA, maybe Mbabu? IIRC he was at Newcastle long enough to count as homegrown, and a young forward. Allan Saint Maxim say.

2020 - Replace Lovren obviously, perhaps by hijacking the Gabriel deal from Arsenal? Or by bringing in an older but good enough CB who never got that big break. Schar maybe, he would have only had a year left on his contract. Other then that not much to do that we didn't IRL. Maybe Soucek or Hojberg, if they're willing to be rotation rather than starters. A rb, if we're taking these individually rather than together.

The problems we have today are from us not making signings in summer 21 and last summer.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bmpzz,t1_j7badeg
"hijo de puta 

Obviously",Liverpool,Yes,j7dl6lu,t1_j7d6kgi
Is there any examples of a club clearing out the squad instead of changing the manager?,Liverpool,Yes,j7ahiov,t1_j7ab5ya
"Getting?  Been toxic for awhile.  Seems pretty clear the club is in shambles.  Gordon was the only one from FSG who gave half a fuck about the club and he‚Äôs gone off to make a few hundred million quid, our Sporting Director bailed, his replacement bailed, and about a zillion other senior staff have fucked off as well.  The entire club is broken.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bm36c,t1_j7ab5ya
I will be amazed if they don't take something from Anfield. They showed a lot of fight against Arsenal yesterday and deserved their win. I've not seen fight like that from our side all season,Liverpool,Yes,j7b2ikl,t1_j7b0m5d
"We looked decent the 10 mins after the break against Brighton aswell iirc. Its how every game goes nowadays. Concede first, then concede another, go to break, look somewhat threatening 10-15 mins after the break without actually scoring any goal, concede again and look terribie for the remainder of the game",Liverpool,Yes,j7aak0i,t1_j7aa0pz
"He's done an Ozil. Got a new contract that he's set for life on and is phoning in performances every week because he knows he's virtually undroppable given his extortionate wages.

Believe it or not we make a lot of money for FSG.,Liverpool,Yes,j7acuyf,t1_j7aci2h
They're sniffing round an NFL franchise apparently they need to sell something in their portfolio to fund that allegedly. We're the obvious asset.,Liverpool,Yes,j7apfrx,t1_j7amuf8
Why would that make sense though?,Liverpool,Yes,j7angq6,t1_j7amuf8
"True that as well. Reporters spoke heavily in the summer that the money was there. That‚Äôs why there were heavy reports about Nunes. However as we all know, Klopp had that interview saying we have all types of midfielders available. Now look at us",Liverpool,Yes,j7cjzor,t1_j7cjqr8
Probably because no one has a clue if it‚Äôs actually true?  You keep saying like that it‚Äôs 100% true when no one outside the club‚Äôs accountants will have any idea if it is.,Liverpool,Yes,j7dfxxg,t1_j7cjqr8
That's the spirit.,Liverpool,Yes,j7ba1on,t1_j7b9oao
I'd love to be able to keep the faith at this point but I'm not even kidding when I say that they blow us away in our current form. I can see this one getting ugly unless Bajcetic turns into prone Busquets.,Liverpool,Yes,j7ba3gv,t1_j7b9oao
Somehow this gets forgotten all the time. They were nothing special before we got ourselves a world class manager.,Liverpool,Yes,j7b7qij,t1_j7b0wc4
"Klopp is a human. If he is getting stressed and losing sleep over the state of the club/squad, pressure from the media. He might wake up 1 day and say maybe this job is not for me anymore.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ayc6n,t1_j7ay0la
"Honestly, because I have no hope that we're going to turn this around and start winning. We haven't had a big signing to inject some hope like Diaz last season, there is no one that is going to come back from injury and relight a fire for us 

I could see us just keep losing for the foreseeable and at some point even if none of the fans are calling for it a manager's position becomes untenable",Liverpool,Yes,j7ayecg,t1_j7ay0la
"Are you paying attention this season...

We are free-falling with no end in sight. It will get worse for Klopp. We are not improving - I don't see a way we can turn this around. 

Zero investment has given us zero chance of rescuing the season. We have given up. 

I have no doubt we will finish in the bottom half this season, closer to relegation than a top 4 place. Remarkably, even worse than Utd during their peak banter era. 

Not only that, there has been a mass exodus at the club. Almost every key department has been affected. From top to bottom - we are in ruins.

Klopp will either walk or get sacked. Pick your poison. The writing is on the wall I'm afraid, we're deluding ourselves thinking otherwise. 

Had the fans or Klopp protested the lack of investment in the squad over the years than maybe we wouldn't be in this position. Yet, here we are, destined for another thirty years in the wilderness. Ugh. 

Liverpool FC will never dominate like they did in the 70/80s again unless we get rich owners. Till then, we continue with our inferiority complex - third richest club in world football, most successful English club in history and we act like we are Spurs.

Matip has a year left on his contract and Gomez is homegrown,Liverpool,Yes,j7b09l9,t1_j7b034z
"All for Milner to go into coaching, he's a proper mentor.

Fab and Hendo have been utter shite tho, not sure how you think they're ever regaining their form for more than 2 games in a row at this point.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b2bra,t1_j7b1q59
"Hendo will probably stay because he‚Äôs a leader, homegrown and no one else in world football would want to take him. Fab can definitely go though, this may be the last summer where we can get a decent fee for him",Liverpool,Yes,j7b3ze4,t1_j7b1q59
Firmino üîë,Liverpool,Yes,j7bf5r3,t1_j7beqwg

"Kid hasn‚Äôt even made the bench lately, which is mind boggling, considering we need a spark every match. Klopp thinks he‚Äôs subbing in for consistency but those players haven‚Äôt been consistent nor impactful.",Liverpool,Yes,j7c4twa,t1_j7c0sec
Yeah it needs to end now. We are in a decline currently. I think the boss can pull us out of it and salvage something get us on the up again. But he needs backing in the summer.,Liverpool,Yes,j7apkre,t1_j7amlc9
"I agree, but I really can't get myself to turn on him when the whole team and club looks terrible and dysfunctional. Even Salah looks like a championship level player.

"He had our best chance of the entire game, if that was Haaland he scores that 10 times out of 10",Liverpool,Yes,j7aepcl,t1_j7a9xn5

"I think this might be the turning point especially if they play like they don‚Äôt care and can‚Äôt even do the basics‚Ä¶if with all that, they lose‚Ä¶I think Anfield will definitely start to visibly turn on the players",Liverpool,Yes,j7be41o,t1_j7ayh2j
"I mean they have insane revenue and sold a shit load of their possible future earnings. Their old president truely fucked them, but on the pitch they are on the right route. Financially I can't really judge them, I know they are pretty fucked but I really didn't care that much to actually follow their financials lmao.

Xavi seems very good overall, the players he wanted are mostly very good. They were also giga lucky with getting Pedri, dude is absolutely worldclass, and Gavi and Balde coming through as well. Their name is also big enough to get players like Lewandowski lol. But comparing us currently with them, its like day and night. They are so fast, so swift lol.

It‚Äôs beyond brainwashed if you think our playing style/ training methods aren‚Äôt the cause of the constant injuries in this team.

"I'd be sad based on his input pre-Afcon for sure. But he, along with everyone else on Saturday are completely fair game imo. He's nowhere near the levels we need him to be, nor that of a player on 350k a week.

People can say he doesn't get the service but it's just nonsense, he can't even do the basics right at the moment. He's utterly devoid of confidence and more worryingly, desire. I fear with that contract, does he even have the incentive to try and get it back?

Might be better doing a Coutinho and cashing in for new blood. They won't be as effective as prime Mo obviously but if they can trap a ball and find a red shirt then their input will be greater than his right now.",Liverpool,Yes,j7an7xl,t1_j7ampr6

This is more than a year old bro. We did relatively quite well before this season. The sentiment on them has changed and majority of this sub is anti FSG now. The comments I‚Äôm referring to are pretty suspect because of the Qatari bootlickers right now among us.,Liverpool,Yes,j7aypza,t1_j7aydc7
Haaland has been great but Ake has been so important for them outside of the goals Haaland offers them nothing,Liverpool,Yes,j7c1c9c,t1_j7c10s6
Grealish right ?,Liverpool,Yes,j7c1j6u,t1_j7c10s6
Would hopefully light a fire under Salah being dropped for a couple games as well since he's never been in that position for us before.,Liverpool,Yes,j7db23a,t1_j7d0wl7
Then they shouldn‚Äôt complain when people call them hypocrites and that they do t speak for every fan,Liverpool,Yes,j7bhxj2,t1_j7bhlho
"Pretty sure fsg donated millions to trump 
No one mentioned wanting  quatar üòÇ 
You can won‚Äôt neither 
Southampton outspend us and they aren‚Äôt state backed last time I checked
Ps I didn‚Äôt downvote you others did",Liverpool,Yes,j7bnvr2,t1_j7bnjtg
"Do you even have a source? Trump was way more in favour of KSA.

Also, Trump initiating the withdrawal from Afghanistan was one of the few things he did right.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bp4ck,t1_j7bnjtg
"God I hope not. Besides Redbird being all around bad news, what a waste of resources and time to seek bids when the owners aren't actually inclined to take them seriously.

I was to understand FSG have been settling up some short term debt on the club, which could provide some hope a full takeover bid could still be what they're after in the end.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ba5e9,t1_j7b7vro
People seem to think we're instantly an unattractive place to come becasue of 1 bad season in 5 years lmfao,Liverpool,Yes,j7azvd4,t1_j7az0hg
"When was the last time we spent 100m for a midfielder, 88m for a winger, in the same season?  We are mid-table and don‚Äôt spent big. Plus Bellingham will be getting offers from Madrid and City.",Liverpool,Yes,j7azauc,t1_j7az0hg
"Maybe get another midfielder? Let‚Äôs not pretend like he‚Äôs the only good midfielder in the world. We came back from challenging for the quadruple, and should have leveraged that",Liverpool,Yes,j7axj1m,t1_j7axcsj
"Yeah, and we also don‚Äôt have the money to spend. So that‚Äôs no money and no European football. What is the draw? He‚Äôs a highly sought after player",Liverpool,Yes,j7ayu2g,t1_j7ay3vi
In terms of money...we have no money,Liverpool,Yes,j7ayiw0,t1_j7ay3vi
"Generally speaking, you want a solid defensive unit that stays in position and doesn't get pulled out of position.  Gomez is playing like Lovren.  They were incapable of keeping a solid defensive unit without A LOT of help.

With that said, that doesn't excuse other players from doing their jobs properly.  Andy was in perfect position and vacated it early, which directly resulted in Acuna (?) being wide open.  It's worse than Gomez because all Andy had to do was stand still for another 2 seconds.",Liverpool,Yes,j7afhdw,t1_j7ae9s6
"TBF though they didn't have a cheap team themselves. Osimhen himself would have been our record transfer. But I get your point, I'd like to see us take some risks like Napoli did by signing Kim Min Jae from Turkey but that'd be a huge deviation from what we've always done.",Liverpool,Yes,j7azi0h,t1_j7axyo4
What if you guys slipped even further down the table?,Liverpool,Yes,j7al4d7,t1_j7aj76n
True,Liverpool,Yes,j7denww,t1_j7daofq
Any teams? Honestly there might be midfields in that league thats prob better than our starting three,Liverpool,Yes,j7ab8el,t1_j7a9zuu
"And what would be the point of that? 

FSG gets enough flak anyway. I guess he is criticizing internally and lets the club know what he needs. 

There is already too much noise around the club and it surely isnt helping currently. Imagine your employer being in disarray. Would you not be insecure about the future? Why should he open up another front?",Liverpool,Yes,j7b0xk7,t1_j7b0dcc
">That‚Äôs what annoys me. Klopps in a position only a couple managers have ever been in where as bad as it gets the fans would never want him out.

>Which makes him more powerful than the owners.

This correlation isn't based on reality but pure fantasy. As if history hasn't shown to us by numerous examples, that Billionaires don't like to be called out.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b1lg0,t1_j7b0dcc
We can't have watched the same player. I lost count of how many times he cut inside to his right and hit a terrible cross either too far or into the keeper's arms. He has been awful since he came in.,Liverpool,Yes,j7acc6i,t1_j7a8z4h
he absolutely wasn't. VVD has been seriously disrespected on here over the course of this season. He's had a few poor moments but by and large he's still been good.,Liverpool,Yes,j7ar8tc,t1_j7aqg8i
Honestly it‚Äôs annoying all there‚Äôs online fans cry ‚Äòoh my god citeh fans are obsessed with us‚Äô then spout shite like this.,Liverpool,Yes,j7bwwtj,t1_j7bs7pp
"The game is fun? The last 7 months has been disastrous as a Liverpool fan. I love the club to death, but I‚Äôm saying football in general has been hard to watch as a Liverpool fan, sure many fans share the same opinion. Not sure how it has anything to do with ‚Äògrowing up‚Äô.",Liverpool,Yes,j7byr9r,t1_j7bxpkj
Dortmund mentioned they had  the same issue with haaland,Liverpool,Yes,j7ckms6,t1_j7c5g6n
But similarly you would argue they are worse in the league this season. Against United and Today he offered very little whereas Jesus or a false 9 could help the link up play and allow them to dominate more,Liverpool,Yes,j7c6j2j,t1_j7c5g6n
It's the truth and you know it,Liverpool,Yes,j7dad94,t1_j7da95p
"He‚Äôs disappearing in big games tho, sure City‚Äôs defence is slop this season but Haaland should be able to make things happen and change games, if Nunez could take his chances he‚Äôd be miles ahead of him",Liverpool,Yes,j7c8pak,t1_j7c7lfv
"Short term could be great (not sure if Klopp stays long after though) and long term, looking at PSG, I can‚Äôt get excited. We think we will be some type of an exception to other soulless, sportwashing clubs because we are Liverpool. It might take a bit longer but we will eventually get there.

Both our current (or most plausible at this point) options are not the best in the short and/or long term. It‚Äôs either rot away with FSG or become a sportwashing project for Qatar‚Äôs government right now. Watch a couple of random businessmen who have no issues investing but United though.",Liverpool,Yes,j7beyms,t1_j7ax8r8
Well to be fair the source also mentioned that we are in contact with QIA.,Liverpool,Yes,j7ay3h3,t1_j7awunp
Kostas has not performed time and time again lol what,Liverpool,Yes,j7bk7v7,t1_j7bh3yz
The only man I‚Äôd say is giving it his all at the moment is Robbo,Liverpool,Yes,j7bi3i6,t1_j7bh3yz
"Even with the Arthur deal I was optimistic because there‚Äôs a very talented player in there. The second he got a long term injury, we should have been pinging the phones of every midfielder on the market about a move, because if the stopgap you‚Äôve signed gets injured, you‚Äôre back at square one but apparently no one at the club understands that.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aiqh1,t1_j7aiie6
"Didn‚Äôt he play in the hole when Chelsea had a 3 man midfield?

Either way, Jorginho specifically isn‚Äôt the point. I‚Äôm just saying that we should really have been looking at the deals other clubs are doing and try to jump in. Sabitzer is another example of a midfielder we just let fly past us",Liverpool,Yes,j7aimqy,t1_j7aikye
"Exactly. I‚Äôd be cautiously optimistic if it was any other team in the CL due to our pedigree, but we‚Äôre playing against the final boss.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bblix,t1_j7bbbia
"Despite how bad they are recently they still have a great midfield. If they still had Casemiro on top of everyone else, he would destroy all of our midfielders while Fabinho would get outrun by even Mariano.",Liverpool,Yes,j7cwx3w,t1_j7cwnfp
"We won't buy him lol, i was thinking barca or Madrid.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b2a3j,t1_j7b25tn
So you guys have 2 left wingers now with Diaz and gakpo?,Liverpool,Yes,j7b2ccg,t1_j7b1zh3
???,Liverpool,Yes,j7bes1n,t1_j7bencl
True. I agree he‚Äôll be done in a year or so. I honestly wish we get Davies at some point. I also honestly don‚Äôt hate Tsimikas.,Liverpool,Yes,j7beyv3,t1_j7bes0e
"If we sign Gerrard. Then gods help you, Theon Greyjoy. Now you are truly lost‚Äù",Liverpool,Yes,j7ahxz9,t1_j7ahtyl
"No, when you have teams like Chelsea, city, newcastle and united around us.",Liverpool,Yes,j7acxfs,t1_j7acusb
Lol was thinking the same,Liverpool,Yes,j7bre1n,t1_j7bph0u
Sure?  He‚Äôs actually pretty decent at a long pass and one of the few mids who actually has a reasonable number of assists in recent seasons.  Our top assisters are almost always the forwards and fullbacks followed usually by Henderson.,Liverpool,Yes,j7c6q5l,t1_j7c0rur
You'll have a 433 and you'll like it!,Liverpool,Yes,j7c1p0r,t1_j7c0xzp
And he injured Diaz. One of the biggest blows to our season.,Liverpool,Yes,j7b7npo,t1_j7b6le8
Aren‚Äôt clowns funny?,Liverpool,Yes,j7bfjlf,t1_j7b956j
"Some people will never learn, man. There's still people going around who believe Man√© was only on 100k til the day he left us. 

They have a story set in their minds and no fact is getting in the way of that.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ag6bh,t1_j7afbv1
There were rumours he felt unappreciated by the club who were making a fuss about Salah renewing. Could have been a bit of both: that and wanting a new challenge.,Liverpool,Yes,j7aggpy,t1_j7afbv1
"Key point is, we didn‚Äôt replace Mane with someone on his level. We got a striker who can‚Äôt score.",Liverpool,Yes,j7aff01,t1_j7afbv1
"Jesus has been injured all season, Nunez has not. Nunez is a striker, we have Mitrovic who has 10 goals in the league. We have Danny Ings who scored 7 goals in all completion, and he plays less games. Maybe we should sign him?",Liverpool,Yes,j7agbzd,t1_j7afzjy
"Yeah I know they can‚Äôt if it‚Äôs a yellow, just seems like a second yellow changes the game so much you‚Äôd want to make sure it‚Äôs the correct decision so allow VAR to check",Liverpool,Yes,j7c43ds,t1_j7c3qqy
His mobility has definitely improved since being in the prem. But yeah he‚Äôs not fast. Besides his technical ability he seems like a real leader to me and we sorely miss that right now as well. Given the athleticism of our front 3 if we have two more athletic players around him I think it‚Äôs fine. Fabinho when great for us was not fast or mobile.,Liverpool,Yes,j7aebbz,t1_j7ae14l
People mistake running around endlessly with playing good,Liverpool,Yes,j7as30u,t1_j7ar706
The narrative around Robbo shifts every time he puts in a decent or bad performance lmao,Liverpool,Yes,j7arvqc,t1_j7ar706
So has Thiago. More goals conceded from possessions lost than goals scored from chance creations.,Liverpool,Yes,j7av6x2,t1_j7ar706
"Can‚Äôt think of any tbh, it‚Äôs just an obvious corollary of the relationship between coach and players going toxic - one or the other must go. 

It‚Äôs far cheaper and - always will be - to bin the manager, whatever level of football you‚Äôre at. Maybe some extremely unusual outliers like Salford where they‚Äôre backed by a whole bunch of millionaires and play in a relatively low league could afford to bin out the squad instead of the manager I suppose, or Chelsea right now where they‚Äôre determined to spend as much as possible.",Liverpool,Yes,j7amhrd,t1_j7ahiov
"Arsenal maybe? 

They backed Arteta in getting rid of Guendouzi, Ozil, Aubameyang over attitude and mentality issues. I think they'd even just given Aubameyang a big new contract just months before Arteta wanted him gone. 

Also got rid of Mustafi who despite being a big investment was rubbish for them. And backed him in pushing Leno and Martinez out to bring in Ramsdale.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bjlgc,t1_j7ahiov
"your right. I think Mane leaving was the biggest factor tho, somehow sadio motivated salah to keep outdo him. kinda like how Suarez and Sturridge competed to outdo each other back in the SAS days. Since Mane gone mo doesn't seem so motivated anymore like he won the war and now enjoy the plunder. Neither Nunez or gakpo for that matter seem to motivate/inspire him to step his game up.",Liverpool,Yes,j7amaxx,t1_j7akjq2
they supposedly dont take money out though. And their profit (which only materialises when they sell percentages) will only grow as long as our valuation grows. Which it wont without significant investment and nobody is investing 400m without a controlling stake,Liverpool,Yes,j7adhvd,t1_j7acuyf
"Because they get money while still hanging on to one of their most valuable assets? If they don't get what they think is a large enough bid for the whole club, they're not going to sell up.",Liverpool,Yes,j7auix4,t1_j7angq6
"
He also had that interview where he accepted he was wrong tbf. That interview got him melo. 

Fsg seems done with the club ever since super league plans went out of the window. At this point they are just trying to spend as little as possible to run the club, therefore no dof, no club doctor and multiple people leaving.

It takes money to pay these people wages. But the media won't mention so they are nitpicking at everything they can. 

From Kornmeyer to Ljinders.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ckm21,t1_j7cjzor
"David Lynch and Mo chatra already referenced it, so it must be true. They are both well reputed to say something like that casually in the passing and that's good enough for me.",Liverpool,Yes,j7dk3ul,t1_j7dfxxg
"I think people project their own willingness to give up on other people.

Jurgen just a couple weeks ago said he had the energy for 10 more years. He isnt likely to give up like most of the fanbase. Its a hard job...tis why you appreciate the good times and dont act like a twat just because you finish second or lose a final",Liverpool,Yes,j7b44dy,t1_j7ayc6n
"It wont be untenable if nobody is asking for it. 

His job is to get the team back to stability. Right now, he is failing at that but it wont be forever.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b4bpt,t1_j7ayecg
"30 years in the wilderness...jesus. As if you were around for even a 6th of them.

Klopp 2 weeks ago - My motivation is no problem,"" Klopp said to BT Sport. ""I am a bit like Obelix, who fell in the‚Ä¶ you know Asterix and Obelix? Ah, you don‚Äôt know it, forget it... I have enough energy for another 10 years if you want!‚Äù

But yeah, he'll walk. Some of you are such babies. The only good thing about a dry spell would be some of you bouncing to Newcastle.

Protest investment. Jesus, some of you",Liverpool,Yes,j7b88o8,t1_j7b7zie
Thought it was Chelsea away during queens death,Liverpool,Yes,j7blvqr,t1_j7blrsx
"It‚Äôs truly just a lack of effort imo. Call it fatigue, disinterest, coming down to earth after last season, I genuinely have no fucking idea. It‚Äôs probably a giant goddamn pie chart full of 2% bullshit reasons all over the board. However, one thing I always loved about our team is the effort. That is not there, and that is why we are even more frustrated.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ab4xp,t1_j7aazob
Hahah shes a keeper.,Liverpool,Yes,j7ab1d1,t1_j7aazdn
"It‚Äôs why we love them, but mate, fifa makes no one happy",Liverpool,Yes,j7ab106,t1_j7aazdn
Bringing on veterans to lock it down doesn‚Äôt work when the veterans cause most of the problems.,Liverpool,Yes,j7d0nqq,t1_j7c4twa
"it‚Äôs true but given the chances darwin has missed it‚Äôs just frustrating to watch . He‚Äôs not a player who can play like bobby and not a clinical finisher. 
he‚Äôs good in a team who sits back and counter attack",Liverpool,Yes,j7abgm7,t1_j7aaum5
That's a whole other story but in general I just don't rate him. When we signed VVD or Alisson as our big signings I totally got it but Darwin? I don't get it. He just isn't worth anywhere near what we paid him and there were so many better ways to spend that money.,Liverpool,Yes,j7acf2u,t1_j7aaum5
How many of those has he scored after taking a touch? Just gets the ball and shoots it straight like a moron,Liverpool,Yes,j7aasd3,t1_j7aaf3n
"I forgot about their academy. If they can produce high-caliber players like Gavi and more importantly retain them, then they'll definitely use it to their advantage and rebuild into their peak team.",Liverpool,Yes,j7d1cew,t1_j7d1153
And we will have only injury prone Matip right after his injury and Phillips at CB. And no subs,Liverpool,Yes,j7axne1,t1_j7axfqt
I hope so brother,Liverpool,Yes,j7csxb8,t1_j7csj60
"Hodgson was sacked with 25 points in 21 games. If we lose to Ev, its 29 from 21.

Roy is the bar",Liverpool,Yes,j7awjbq,t1_j7arv74
"yeah part of why i think that way is because all of these  stake news comes from Echo, which have been sort of FSG's boston globe; they report what FSG wants them to say. Regardless hope something gets sorted soon. The waiting game itself is exhausting",Liverpool,Yes,j7aesyn,t1_j7aejou
They had a week off after the Brighton loss and we thought it would wake them up‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..,Liverpool,Yes,j7a7e5d,t1_j7a68zo
"Glad you‚Äôve put that out there. Some fans have short term memory loss it seems. He‚Äôs due some criticism for his torrid performances, but we can‚Äôt negate what he‚Äôs done for us, applies to Klopp and many of the world class performers we‚Äôve had over the years.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bsetm,t1_j7bqom0
"Trent is a right back and has been since he first came into the first team a big reason for his form is due to the system completely falling flat and having no midfield in front of him to help defend, he's not even getting over the halfway line anymore to affect the game in the final third.

Matips been poor this season but saying he isn't good enough anymore isn't right, once VVD is back and next to him he'll be better.

Gomez we kind of need to keep because he's homegrown, I'd rather sell him as well but what homegrown CB would we get in place for him?",Liverpool,Yes,j7b1qqz,t1_j7b0ucg
"Ahhh Kornmeyer the modern Achterberg. 
The evil scrupulous twat that sits in John Henry‚Äôs and Klopps ear and destroys every possible thing in our club. Manc probably trained a fitness coach for 10years in Muinch to infiltrate us and fuck our golden gen up.",Liverpool,Yes,j7ciy7m,t1_j7ce9hn
He‚Äôs making Klopp ignore the social media advice and it‚Äôs causing real friction behind the scenes and he‚Äôs insisting we make a MySpace,Liverpool,Yes,j7cj06t,t1_j7ce9hn
We were all watching these videos seeing our players happy and training in great form. Then along comes Fsg saying that posting these videos harms profits and banned this,Liverpool,Yes,j7ceymm,t1_j7cdzsy
Banned it here since the videos are only available on   Lfc Go which is a paid membership subscription,Liverpool,Yes,j7cg4o1,t1_j7cfc7n
"Most of the time it is with media though, gets clicks and outrages the weirdos",Liverpool,Yes,j7atb5i,t1_j7asgm3
Well I doubt you're going to get a lightning fast response on a Sunday afternoon. We'll see. To be fair if you read their previous statement in full I think this incident can be covered by that one too.,Liverpool,Yes,j7atksk,t1_j7asscj
Gapko has been fairly ineffective so far yep,Liverpool,Yes,j7bnfw6,t1_j7bminl
Reddy is a known shill for corporate owners. She‚Äôs been doing fluff pieces for the Glazers too. It‚Äôs a bit concerning FSG are trying to blame Klopp through the media.,Liverpool,Yes,j7at6zr,t1_j7aqyxz
"Almost like reddit posters don't know what they are talking about when it comes to tactics. My favourite complaint here is why does Klopp only play 433 he is so one dimensional and rigid. 

As if formations are a rigid thing on the field and people are told to stand in one area of field only, like people haven't heard things about interchanging freely  moving positional play.",Liverpool,Yes,j7b4sv6,t1_j7b4fp4
"Can't u see it here as well? They are so similar. And this is from the 2019 season.

Also we are trying different formations and tinkering with salah positioning more this season, sometimes in 442 or 424. Also this is half a season of heatmap, Nunez, jota and Diaz coming back will change Salah position more won't it?",Liverpool,Yes,j7cgx8h,t1_j7cgkon
"Then there's last years where the change was made and thats a full year.

"Neither did anything about Hicks and Gillet as well, just sat on the sideline and kept their mouth shut instead of supporting the local protestors. Pep Reina of all the people from the club called out the ownership.",Liverpool,Yes,j7awms4,t1_j7au8kd
"A protest has to have an aim or it's just a whinge. If your only tangible aim is ""Showing FSG they've ran us badly"" and then saying it's because of all of the other stuff they did but conveniently only takes place now we're shit then not only is it not going to achieve anything but it looks stupid too",Liverpool,Yes,j7ay01n,t1_j7attqx
"How does it matter if it‚Äôs a year old? Those accounts still exist. There was a lot of arguing here in the summer when we didn‚Äôt get a 4th CB. We then went and wasted an entire season, during which the FSG defenders had gone quiet. And yet that post was still made and hundreds of users still upvoted bootlicking comments despite of that horrible season. This past summer, people were supporting FSG whenever the midfield situation was brought up. We started the season poorly and the FSGin people either went quiet or went to r/soccer to complain about how whiny this place has become. Some of us have been here for years, we know how the clockwork goes. We‚Äôll salvage something from this season eventually/hopefully, and the FSG asskissing will resume.",Liverpool,Yes,j7azl4j,t1_j7aypza
">outside of the goals Haaland offers them nothing

Thats true but at the end of the day scoring is what he's there for and he's scored a mad amount as well.",Liverpool,Yes,j7c1phx,t1_j7c1c9c
Dude he has banged in 25 goals for them. On track to demolish Salah's record. Pretty sure that's more than enough for him to offer nothing outside of just goal scoring.,Liverpool,Yes,j7cbezg,t1_j7c1c9c
Agreed,Liverpool,Yes,j7bi9vw,t1_j7bhxj2
"I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm being an extreme pessimist if I was to believe what I originally said. It makes no sense for either party, but regardless, RedBird have financial pressure placed upon the reliance and promise they‚Äôve secured Milan fans of rebuilding a new stadium. Why on earth would that mean that they‚Äôd spend a billion on investing in FSG? Makes no sense. Also, your point about the debt is spot on. It‚Äôs all a hoax in my opinion, plus whatever they do has no bearings upon the sale.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bs4z0,t1_j7ba5e9
"The amount of debt we have is near insignificant to the size of what they seem to want to sell for though.  Seems to be a popular line, but any new owners aren‚Äôt going to be too fussed about our current debt levels.",Liverpool,Yes,j7bjqm5,t1_j7ba5e9
Funny goal post move tbh,Liverpool,Yes,j7b2eob,t1_j7azauc

"Oh I‚Äôm not, I agree with what you are saying, we should have got a midfielder. We were linked with Nunes and ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt afford‚Äù to pay his release clause, we should have done that and got him in the summer. We should have added another midfielder in the winter window as well.",Liverpool,Yes,j7axyp8,t1_j7axj1m
"We clearly do have it to spend...its what its spent on. For example...they chose to spend 40 on Gakpo and not another position.

Included add ons...80+ on Nunez and not other positions. Whats the draw...seriously?",Liverpool,Yes,j7b3tzr,t1_j7ayu2g
We clearly do.,Liverpool,Yes,j7b3zuh,t1_j7ayiw0
"doesn‚Äòt change it. j√ºrgen has done more than enough to earn his go at a rebuild. sacking him would be the worst thing possible.

"Ignore him he‚Äôs a plastic. Reality is Klopp had enough good wills in the bank right now, however he will need to start changing things.

We can cry until the cows come home about lack of investment yet the investment we have had has been misspent of late, we‚Äôre needed a midfielder for how long? We sign Gakpo in January. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll be a fine player but he wasn‚Äôt needed, especially to play out of position.
I think Klopp gets until this time next year, if things don‚Äôt improve I think he walks to be honest. He looks like it‚Äôs all getting to him. 

Klopp has strengths that out weight his weaknesses but he used to have a team that mitigated he weaknesses, right now the clubs having endless shake ups behind the scenes, Klopp and pep seem to be getting more and more power, taking on more and more responsibilities and it does not work at all. 

We need to go back to what we were doing, everything was analytical and there were teams of people looking at players etc now it‚Äôs pep whispering to Klopp ‚ÄòGakpo init lad fuck midfield‚Äô it seems.",Liverpool,Yes,j7avfph,t1_j7al4d7

"No one can actually explain how Matip was apparently better than VVD over the whole of last season (which ended in Matip getting demoted behind Konate).

Not true, multiple times salah drifted out wide for the ball, as a midfielder went forward, he also drifted inwards into a striker's position or cut inwards to pass the ball in the box. 

>the midfield are pretty rigid 

Did I just imagine keita in the box multiple times in a good scoring position where he fluffed the shot, Thiago and Bajcetic camped right outside the box in the second half to retain position and recycling the ball. 

Hell even hendo did a daft trick where he left the ball for the person behind him.

Didn't you see trent in the box taking a shot instead of passing? Also Robbo by the byline, his passes barely going beyond the first defender.

I think he is just less clinical in front of goal and the team is creating less high quality chances for him, positional wise all heat maps are similar at least to me.

">Salah is practically always as wide as the toucline now there's no drifting out wide needed most of the time because he's stuck out there.

Are we just talking about yesterday's match or overall because there is a distinction, yesterday salah wasn't that outwide he had some decent chances to score, like three to four at least, with one or two he came close to scoring. 

Also this is the first time in weeks salah is playing with nunez and Gakpo and would get some of his own space as the defense had other players to concentrate on, instead of trying to go outwide to find more space he was able to play in the half space and would either be in a space which a striker would occupy or would go outwide. 

Hugging the line is a myth people keep repeating maybe it was early in the season, but not so anymore. 

>Wow he got in the box once to hit a shot most of the time he was behind the halfway line barely getting the chance to influence the game in the final third. 

This is such a weird thing to nitpick on trent not overlapping anymore,  cause this was the precise reason why the team kept getting caught on the counter attack as we don't have anyone covering the space left behind by an overlapping trent. 

So trent has been told to use his passing range to dictate play from deep which he is doing fine as a tactic, Nunez nearly scored from a deep ball from trent, as he has done earlier. 

Due to this very change in tactics trent has been getting praise post world cup and is yet to be beaten by any player outwide other than mitoma. 

Even Man city doesn't play with two overlapping wide men. At best cancelo used to go overlapping while walker used to stay behind, forming three at the back. 

This is just biased pov from you, forming an agenda cause if Trent was caught upfield you would be criticising this very tactic. 

>even Robbo hardly gets forward as much as he used to now.

Robbo is overlapping fine, its only his final ball devilery which has been poor. Even Tsmikas is making deep runs, many times Robbo and Tsmikas have found themselves in the box and have taken a shot or two at goal. 

Trent goes in the box whenever he gets a chance and doesn't have to go back and forth anymore and get caught lacking. 

>
What when we were 2-0 down? of course they're going to push up higher when we are chasing a lead it would be worrying if they didn't.

It wasn't a tactical decision to go down  2-0 by the 12th mins surely. Maybe we wouldn't have pushed up quite a bit like we did yesterday but surely we would have attacked.

Overall, its been a change that was made from the start of last season and it only really worked because Salah was in incredible form and able to beat 2/3 men and score or find a killer pass so why perssist with it when he's not capable of doing that now?

>Hugging the line is a myth people keep repeating maybe it was early in the season, but not so anymore.

[https://www.sofascore.com/player/mohamed-salah/159665](https://www.sofascore.com/player/mohamed-salah/159665)

His heat map is pretty telling, hugging the touchline for the majority of it and you can look at last seasons its the exact same but looking at seasons before then its clearly a majority of it is in the box.

>So trent has been told to use his passing range to dictate play from deep which he is doing fine as a tactic, Nunez nearly scored from a deep ball from trent, as he has done earlier.

We're still getting countered down his side anyway what difference does it make? having him positioned where he is just takes away the threat he gives when it comes to the final third, a couple deep long balls to Nunez in comparison to the amount of chances he used to consistently create when further up the pitch.

>Even Man city doesn't play with two overlapping wide men. At best cancelo used to go overlapping while walker used to stay behind, forming three at the back.

Every fullback gets countered, cause it's football. Are we conceding less goals on his side? 

Yes. The first two goals were literally on the other side, not Trent's. The third goal was further up the field. 

Even the mitoma goal was on the other side. 

Plus Trent is being used to mop up loose balls, and is playing a deep playmaker role. He is creating enough and it's not like he is restricted to only staying back. He gets plenty of opportunities to go up the field whenever he can and if the side is dominating with the ball, like yesterday in the second half.

He seems immune to criticism. Most people blaming Gomez for that first goal üòÇ,Liverpool,Yes,j76y5p5,t1_j76xar3
"and robertson too, he's not even trying to do last ditch tackle on traore or even block the passing lane just keep watching",Liverpool,Yes,j777y57,t1_j76xar3
"Yeah, I'm feeling that I'm evil. Arsenal fans would be unbearable, they already are. And I don't want them to succeed, cause they have such a young squad, that they would be only better next year.",Liverpool,Yes,j76ng2u,t1_j76mi1w
Good manager. Seems to care about his players. He‚Äôs hated here because he plays the kind of football that foils Klopp. It‚Äôs ugly to watch. But he can hang with teams more talented than his.,Liverpool,Yes,j76pwzt,t1_j76pa07
He's a far more technical manager than some of the lazy takes on here would have you believe. I saw someone the other day saying his style of any at Burnley was just putting 10 men behind the ball and praying. Anyone who's actually listened to the man would know there's far more to it than that. I'd love to see what he could do with a proper budget.,Liverpool,Yes,j76ulby,t1_j76pa07
Dyche is a good guy and a red. I hate that he's there.,Liverpool,Yes,j76ppl5,t1_j76pa07
It‚Äôs just how his teams played at Burnley was always a dirty match but most would say he did really well with what he did with them,Liverpool,Yes,j76prwj,t1_j76pa07
He hasn't been the same since he lost his mum.,Liverpool,Yes,j77bq40,t1_j77a26j
"Klopp's system is only successful when the best defender in world plays the CB role to perfection and at it's most difficult in terms of covering the most space any CB in history has had to cover.
I'm sorry but you shouldn't need a ballon d'or CB or a GK oerperforming so unsustainably for your entire system to function.",Liverpool,Yes,j77cgzz,t1_j77a26j
"We were playing in a new and more compact way, then we had another cb injury. They are in such shit form that we can't play that compact way with them. Especially given the state of our midfield. Nor can we Kevin Keegan Newcastle it, because we bought poorly and should have sold Salah.",Liverpool,Yes,j77emb1,t1_j77a26j
"This is what so many people fail to see...

He's far too stubborn and loyal to his tactics, washed players, and our owners...

The writing is on the wall for J√ºrgen I'm afraid..

He only has himself to blame. He could have stood up to the owners, he could have refreshed the squad, he could have changed the system...

But he didn't and here we are. Free falling, the laughing stock of the league, and in need of serious serious investment. 

It's hard to hear but the Klopp era is over ladies and gentlemen.",Liverpool,Yes,j77ey2j,t1_j77a26j
"It has to be the takeover and the power shift behind the scenes, but we definitely need some info rather than.

We are sorry we will do better next time üí™",Liverpool,Yes,j77bo40,t1_j77ab78
"He‚Äôs very very good, but I think the players are a utter fucking disgrace. 

How long has he been in charge ? I don‚Äôt think even Klopp or Pep could get truly shite players playing this good in a week. 

This to me shows that it‚Äôs just a fact the players stopped playing for their manager, which should never ever be acceptable for me, a week ago the players were a disgrace, they was confronting them in their cars. Manager goes, now they‚Äôre cheering them. 

It‚Äôs the same bunch of players who weren‚Äôt running, weren‚Äôt tackling, we‚Äôre throwing your club under the bus with shitshow after shitshow. 

Just can‚Äôt comprehend how you can go from that to this in a week, with Dyche. Granted yeah he‚Äôs good. But I‚Äôd be surprised if pep or klopp had got this out of that pile of players. I think they‚Äôre a utter disgrace personally as it shows it was just a lack of effort and commitment. Which is the only non negotiable.",Liverpool,Yes,j76mu51,t1_j76mirw
Tbh he would do a better job defensively than Klopp at Liverpool,Liverpool,Yes,j76n1pt,t1_j76mirw
The silence and body language is great lol,Liverpool,Yes,j76nc4m,t1_j76mvv1

"Unfortunately it won't cut it in the prem now, but this doesn't mean we need state money. A consortium with ambition would be better than FSG",Liverpool,Yes,j77hfnz,t1_j77h527
Check our fixtures after towards the end of Feb when we play Madrid. We are doomed,Liverpool,Yes,j76y62w,t1_j76x55y
At this pace they'll still hit 95 points though.,Liverpool,Yes,j76ubjd,t1_j76pulk

"They haven‚Äôt splashed money around crazy yet. If they really start bringing the oil money to bear while maintaining some discipline in building their squad, competition for the top four is going to be a tough for a while.",Liverpool,Yes,j77iza4,t1_j77g7ft
"Thats not a bad thing at all, and plenty in the ground on match days could use a similar attitude. The players have a much better chance of turning things around with positivity behind them from the fans",Liverpool,Yes,j76e1xq,t1_j76bmpn

"You're already a lot more likeable than the pack of moaners that appear here in the match threads. Weird bunch, they were always there when we were involved in title races, they seem to absolutely revel in delight now that we've lost our way.",Liverpool,Yes,j76eyly,t1_j76bmpn
Basically the only games in the last 10 years I expected us to lose was City this year (1-0 win lol) and the Madrid group stage game under Rodgers where we actually played well,Liverpool,Yes,j76f0v3,t1_j76bmpn
Tactical mastermind dyche outthinks pep prodigy,Liverpool,Yes,j76gzh1,t1_j76gsfe
You usually would wake up in bed realising that all of this was just a dream.,Liverpool,Yes,j77agml,t1_j779s7f
Did he pay 70m for Nunez?,Liverpool,Yes,j77bzvi,t1_j77bqxj
If we win the next 20 we should be comfortably top 4,Liverpool,Yes,j75y1gc,t1_j75xst1
"What if Newcastle and United also win their games? We'd be 7 off then

Edit: oh of course, we play Newcastle one of those games!",Liverpool,Yes,j75y8vi,t1_j75xst1
Onana woud be a perfect Liverpool player. How did we miss him ? How do we not sign any young players from Belgium when they have been coming up with promising talent since so long ?,Liverpool,Yes,j76je3q,t1_j76ibsz
He was a huge problem when we played them earlier in the season,Liverpool,Yes,j76ium0,t1_j76ibsz
Good. James is a clown,Liverpool,Yes,j77kw4v,t1_j77kgcq
He gives me such Pickford vibes,Liverpool,Yes,j76jj3c,t1_j76jc40
"I just wanna see something go against them to give us a more exciting race. Fair play to them if they win every game and no one catches them, but I wanna see them get knocked down and get back up again. They've played excellent, but they've also had a couple of games this season where they've gotten away with it. I think the only time they've been hard done by was the first game against United.",Liverpool,Yes,j76jmcs,t1_j76jcut
Arsenal's public enemy number one,Liverpool,Yes,j76p56l,t1_j76ozlo
I do not look forward to any game hereafter. We're done for until we get a better squad or better owners.,Liverpool,Yes,j76zbvc,t1_j76pdeq
But he can do that jumpy penalty though,Liverpool,Yes,j76qfxb,t1_j76pkv6
Onana is going to eat naby for lunch isn't he. They have good physical presence in midfield. Our match should be a good indicator of what's to come next week. Let's see.,Liverpool,Yes,j76qv5n,t1_j76q3y9
Arsenal fans have become incredibly smug. I'll be very happy to see them bottle the league. I don't know any City fans anyway. Their titles are empty to me.,Liverpool,Yes,j76p25l,t1_j76oqsn
"Yeah, as much as it would be nice to skip Goodison for at least a season, Everton does not sound like a club that can afford relegation right now.",Liverpool,Yes,j76p1vi,t1_j76oqsn
"He's back in training next week

Probably a few weeks before we see him I'd have thought",Liverpool,Yes,j75qfsm,t1_j75q6tb
"Everton are sucessfully pressing high in a 4-3-2-1 formation but turn to 4-4-2 when pushed back. On the turn around, Everton has runners running down the wings and passing it to the strikers. They had two or three very good ""tap in chances"" made that way.",Liverpool,Yes,j76gu4k,t1_j76gdxi
Missed a couple of big chances should be 2-0,Liverpool,Yes,j76gi88,t1_j76gdxi
"FSG are too cheap to sack him, if anything it‚Äôll be the new owners",Liverpool,Yes,j76yz7g,t1_j76vcun

Manager of the month curse strikes again and promptly,Liverpool,Yes,j76pkwy,t1_j76ph4i
They have understandably given up on the season. A lot of them probably realized we wouldn‚Äôt be challenging when we didn‚Äôt invest in the summer. Imagine being Salah and realizing you‚Äôre facing a full season with players who should‚Äôve retired. January transfer window was the last nail in the coffin. They know there is no way we‚Äôre getting top 4 with this squad. We have nothing to play for.,Liverpool,Yes,j772ivs,t1_j770jb3
Every team does,Liverpool,Yes,j76hm03,t1_j76gyvi
Same honestly. Don't get me wrong those two games were still shit but we were deffo improved.,Liverpool,Yes,j768zbv,t1_j767kxq
lol,Liverpool,Yes,j77fmra,t1_j767kxq
Got to wonder if there might be something going on behind the scenes with him,Liverpool,Yes,j76njh3,t1_j76mkz8
Yep. Their pressing is decent.,Liverpool,Yes,j76fguk,t1_j76fa89
tbf their press has been good. They are not just parking the bus.,Liverpool,Yes,j76l8dm,t1_j76kzkw
His experience and leadership could be key in the title race + more legs in midfield is always good,Liverpool,Yes,j76p2bi,t1_j76owg4
"Bellingham is a red herring at this point.

The club has significant issues with departing personnel and general professionalism that don't seem to be dealt with with any urgency. Then there's the overall question of ownership change and investment. 

Finally there's the issues on the pitch, which are incredibly varied, and aren't going to be solved by one player.

It's much more important that we get rid of many players and have a very lean squad next year since we won't be in Europe and need to rebuild. More important who goes than who comes in.",Liverpool,Yes,j77dvlh,t1_j77bi90
"Salah has always been a goalscorer not a winger which is why I used to cringe when I saw Messi and Hazards comparisons. Salah can't hold a candle to that level of playmaking from wide but he can get close to Messi goal numbers which is valuable in it's own right.

Once you put Nunez/Gakpo there, take away his space, and ask him to be an actual winger this is exactly what you get. I don't get this rebuild from Klopp at all. Make no mistake Nunez 100% his signing.",Liverpool,Yes,j77do4q,t1_j77cmjy
I mean I knew a season like this was coming eventually. The pressure of having to win literally every game and get 100 points for 4 straight years and playing with intensity we do was going to let up eventually.,Liverpool,Yes,j77j6u3,t1_j77h3aw
"Our midfield would get out run, but I don't see them scoring. They can't find the back of the net",Liverpool,Yes,j76gkdy,t1_j76geox
100%,Liverpool,Yes,j76gjg0,t1_j76geox
Once they are relegated he‚Äôs more than welcome.,Liverpool,Yes,j76g410,t1_j76g1ao
Said this before West Ham we‚Äôre in for him we should have been having that lad. A monster of anplayer and loyal too it seems,Liverpool,Yes,j76jiin,t1_j76g1ao
"You mean will he start the only player who has scored for the club in the past 3 games- or we want to laugh at the very idea?

Liverpool fans, man. Every day I see a greater gap between the word fan and the word supporter.",Liverpool,Yes,j765mly,t1_j75x4cf
I think he plays Elliott. Darwin isn't playing well enough to start,Liverpool,Yes,j75yrb5,t1_j75x4cf
"He's definitely got them believing they can play football again, though I don't know if he'll keep them composed enough to the end of the season.",Liverpool,Yes,j76o6zq,t1_j76nv2g
"I was shocked when I saw all of the people going after Klopp for that. If Klopp is mad at him I know it‚Äôs for a good reason, Ill back Klopp over Pearce no matter what. Pearce has also been a joke of a ‚Äújournalist‚Äù for a long time. He deflects all blame off of FSG towards the coaching staff.",Liverpool,Yes,j789btr,t1_j77pyki
Anguissa completely dominated on napoli home iirc,Liverpool,Yes,j76l0jw,t1_j76kvkq
That cost money which fsg are allergic to spending and would expose them,Liverpool,Yes,j77ah0r,t1_j7796ow
They are on 50 points 19 games in. That's good even by the standard us and City set these past years.,Liverpool,Yes,j76hg9e,t1_j76g5f3
"You're just being entitled, we're doing perfectly fine with our 19 year old winger from the championship as our main midfielder",Liverpool,Yes,j76lapo,t1_j76jhe1
"""Because they're not the right midfielders""",Liverpool,Yes,j76jucp,t1_j76jhe1
Our owners want to get the money back for loans they gave us instead of strengthening the squad,Liverpool,Yes,j76jvw5,t1_j76jhe1
"Oh, I've been here many times. I've been watching this team since I was born, about 32 of which I remember.

It's mostly been shit. I know this feeling well. I know how people are going to crucify nice people giving their all for the club, I know how people will trott out the same platitudes, and ignore context. It's football.",Liverpool,Yes,j77eabu,t1_j77acdw
"I'm indifferent because the last few years have been the best of times and I have full faith in Klopp. You can't have sustained success of that level, 3 CL Finals in 5 years, 90+ seasons and winning the absolute lot in that period.",Liverpool,Yes,j77atpl,t1_j77acdw
Not really. They fought hard and no arguments that they deserved 3 points.,Liverpool,Yes,j76pf89,t1_j76p0o4
They outplayed Arsenal tbh,Liverpool,Yes,j76pn1f,t1_j76p0o4
Hope the bald demon saves football,Liverpool,Yes,j76rfce,t1_j76pw3i
Hope they lose by 2 points,Liverpool,Yes,j76w52c,t1_j76pw3i
I'd rather Arsenal than City.,Liverpool,Yes,j76rvln,t1_j76pw3i
There was clear signs we needed some midfielders since the summer window and FSG decide getting the money from the club for its debt was the best kind of transaction.,Liverpool,Yes,j772mus,t1_j7720eu
"Scum signed Eriksen as a free agent, Tielemans can also turn good, I think it‚Äôs a no brained since 2-3 midfield players will leave Liverpool this summer and we will need depth, he won‚Äôt be on astronomical wages as well",Liverpool,Yes,j7600ie,t1_j75z46u
"I think he‚Äôs a decent player, and could help the squad, but i don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs started quality and I think he‚Äôd want to be starting wherever he goes. 

Plus I know it‚Äôs absolutely to his credit that he‚Äôs already played like 500 games at his age, but I would see that as a potential concern too; that he also has the potential to start declining / picking up injuries soon. Maybe that‚Äôs just paranoia on my part. I think of Owen saying he always feels he played too much too young; I believe Lallana had played a crazy amount of games for Southampton over the years before we signed him too. 

And free signing also doesn‚Äôt mean there wouldn‚Äôt be a sizeable signing on fee either. For me, I wouldn‚Äôt take him unless about 3-4 other key targets went elsewhere. 

I also feel like he‚Äôs probably got the club he wants to sign for lined up already, he‚Äôll likely be one of the first players to sign for a club this summer.",Liverpool,Yes,j765h1a,t1_j75z46u
"Tielemans is a talented player but I have doubts about 2 aspects of his game. His willingness/ability to press/defend aggressively and his mentality. He looks similar to Thiago but Thiago at his best defends relentlessly and tackles without hesitation. I'm not sure Tielemans can do that. Additionally, people last season were criticising his ""body language"". That's a pretty vague accusation, but it's also a problem we have this season.

My take is that we could sign him, but as a bonus to Jude and a more defensive midfielder.",Liverpool,Yes,j75zvdo,t1_j75z46u
"Better options available for lesser package. Free agent is also costly with agent fees,sign on bonus, higher wage than regular.",Liverpool,Yes,j762bsj,t1_j75z46u
No. He's not very good.,Liverpool,Yes,j7633i7,t1_j75z46u
They have led me to support everton for 1 match.,Liverpool,Yes,j76ktwj,t1_j76kcqu
They're by far the most unbareable fan base and I quite like them as a club as well but the online fans are a different breed from any other teams.,Liverpool,Yes,j76kqkf,t1_j76kcqu
All the yanks have come out with their Arsenal flairs talking about flops and cleats and they‚Äôre fucking insufferable.,Liverpool,Yes,j76kkhq,t1_j76kcqu

Hopefully they win need spurs to drop points,Liverpool,Yes,j76n7z5,t1_j76n2tu
Spurs never roll over against them so i'd imagine it will be another great game.,Liverpool,Yes,j76n8jm,t1_j76n2tu
"Nah they‚Äôll smell blood, peps let his mate have a good run so he keeps his job, pep wills team roll the league now. Arteta goes back to being a Pictionary loving meme next season",Liverpool,Yes,j76okvb,t1_j76n2tu
Best we can do is Elliot-Gakpo-Salah with Nunez coming on in the 70th min and have no time to build into the game.,Liverpool,Yes,j76m0fr,t1_j76lc4j

So Gakpo #10?,Liverpool,Yes,j76llt3,t1_j76lc4j
No one else wanted us to win the league so why should we care if it doesn‚Äôt involve us,Liverpool,Yes,j76odac,t1_j76o3ci

"I'm just petty and want a team besides us to know what it's like to lose out on the title to Man City.

"Citys soul has long since been sold, ours hasn't",Liverpool,Yes,j76on2c,t1_j76o3ci
My guess is it's not wanting City to win as much as it's not wanting Arsenal to win.,Liverpool,Yes,j76perw,t1_j76o3ci
People view City as a person playing with cheatcodes. It hurts less because a 'real' person didn't beat you.,Liverpool,Yes,j76pr99,t1_j76o3ci
"I agree, we are watching a team not playing for their manager every time they go on the pitch. Week in week out. 

Even with three top signings that doesn‚Äôt change",Liverpool,Yes,j76xf3n,t1_j76vup7

"Nunez was a great move, but any player being the only move was a bad idea. We needed Nunez for the future and at least one player who could play in the midfield this year, and yet‚Ä¶",Liverpool,Yes,j77jl80,t1_j77fbbj
Yeah he's good but people talk him up as some special quality of player when its not really the case,Liverpool,Yes,j76k4nu,t1_j76k0f8
I've never understood the Zinchenko hate.,Liverpool,Yes,j76kcdu,t1_j76k0f8

"Sure he looks out of ideas, but he has created success out of nothing since he arrived. It was never gonna last with our transfer strategy. 

Blaming Klopp under these circumstances is like blaming the race car driver when the owner refuses to pay for maintenance on the car.",Liverpool,Yes,j773yge,t1_j772isy
Klopp should probably think about changing system before he does anything,Liverpool,Yes,j777esh,t1_j776z9f

"Neuhaus is shit, Tonali won‚Äôt leave Milan, Laimer just joined Bayern, Brozovic isn‚Äôt in our age bracket, Ward prowse would be overpriced and isn‚Äôt that good, Valverde would be more expensive than Jude, Milinkovic savic is probably slightly too old, Chelsea might go for Zakaria

Manuel ugarte
Kouadio Kone

If we were given the funds i would say sign Bellingham, ugarte,Nunes. Scalvini he's been impressive in serie a for Atalanta.  he can play as 6, CB with matip aging he could be great option to add.",Liverpool,Yes,j7625ml,t1_j7609ub
"With Ox leaving we need to be looking at bringing in a new homegrown player, and fortunately there's quite a few that could be available in the summer.

Rice has 2 years on his contract and is absolutely top class so I'd be very surprised if he doesn't move in the summer. I'd expect both Arsenal and City to be in for him, as well as maybe United. I think we should be looking at him but given its a domestic deal we should bail if the price goes too high.

Obviously Bellingham should be number 1 priority, and while I don't think he'll end up here, we should absolutely be doing everything we can to make his decision difficult. Only downside to this one is that I don't think he counts as homegrown, but that shouldn't stop us trying for him.

Ward-Prowse would be cheap and has a great fitness record, but he's also 28 so probably isn't quite the age profile we're after. I do think he'd be a good deal alongside some younger players though.

I also reckon we look at Gallagher and Mount too, but it'll all depend on who else is involved and what they're prepared to pay. Mount signing a new contract will also close that door.",Liverpool,Yes,j7675lt,t1_j7609ub

"It's now that we'll see what they're made of. They've opened the door to City, and they're gonna have to dig deep to show everyone they're mentally up to it. Losing to City with a game against them still to play would be pretty disastrous.",Liverpool,Yes,j76tgxt,t1_j76qnkf
">if Klopp walks this club loses immense value.

I dont think it will. Klopp is bound to leave one day anyway. Also the likes of De Zerbi or Thomas Frank or even Tuchel could be the next contender.",Liverpool,Yes,j77drl9,t1_j77df9a
">FSG are screwing themselves over



>dreadful performances

Uuuh",Liverpool,Yes,j77dlmv,t1_j77df9a
Decent game yesterday and probably an improvement on our current form but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs on a title challenging level tbh,Liverpool,Yes,j76ctfo,t1_j765dc0
Hindsight is a funny thing,Liverpool,Yes,j765mdm,t1_j765dc0
But Jones is homegrown and only 22.,Liverpool,Yes,j76dugg,t1_j765dc0
they have more legs than ours,Liverpool,Yes,j76dtuc,t1_j76dggy
Have legs will run,Liverpool,Yes,j76foog,t1_j76dggy
Yes. Onana and Iwobi controlled the midfield pretty well against us. We were lucky they have absolutely no one who can finish.,Liverpool,Yes,j76dixx,t1_j76dggy
"Obviously not

Edit: I get we aren't doing well but if people seriously think relegation-battling Everton have better midfielders than we do then I don't know what to say. They're horrendous all over the pitch",Liverpool,Yes,j76dn2g,t1_j76dggy
not more talented but better legs,Liverpool,Yes,j76ggvo,t1_j76dggy
Why would you want city to win the league,Liverpool,Yes,j76totv,t1_j76qk2x

Best RW going in football presently,Liverpool,Yes,j76gei3,t1_j76fsob
"Probably the fact he's 20 years old and playing in a team that looks shite doesn't help. He might not end up having a place in our team, but we'll still sell him at a profit so we can't really lose.",Liverpool,Yes,j766ew4,t1_j765o5i
There‚Äôs been exceptions to the rule but I‚Äôm pretty sure most signings don‚Äôt feature as much in their first season with us,Liverpool,Yes,j767kjf,t1_j765o5i
"200m wont cut it. Thats just Jude and Nunes. Need one more cb, a rw backup and another more defensive minded cm. 350m is needed but maybe FSG are gone by then",Liverpool,Yes,j75rhg2,t1_j75q5ow
"I agree.

I could see us signing Bellingham, Matheus, Gvardiol, Zieler and Mount for over ¬£200m",Liverpool,Yes,j75z65e,t1_j75q5ow
It‚Äôs literally just said as an attempt to wind us up and it seems to work tbh.,Liverpool,Yes,j77inao,t1_j77i5nw
well that was...........something.,Liverpool,Yes,j75ynbg,t1_j75q2n5
"Pep did it with Lahm and Alaba at Bayern, and Arteta learned a lot from Pep, so I don't think it's new.",Liverpool,Yes,j76ea2h,t1_j76dmh5
Trent has been playing like that for us this season. Robbo on the other hand doesn't have the technicality to play that role.,Liverpool,Yes,j76e6mh,t1_j76dmh5
We‚Äôve already tried it with Trent this season Elliott would go wide and overlap with Salah and Trent would come central,Liverpool,Yes,j76e3es,t1_j76dmh5
How central are we talking? More loosely trent obviously becomes a midfielder for us in possession. But city have been doing that for a while with their RB too,Liverpool,Yes,j76dytq,t1_j76dmh5

"There is no debate has a ‚Äògood‚Äô player, nothing more nothing less, he‚Äôs a James Milner type but not as good. People acting like he‚Äôs the new footballing god for some reason.",Liverpool,Yes,j76lbxn,t1_j76krea
He‚Äôs not going to lol. Don‚Äôt listen to those stupid fucks,Liverpool,Yes,j77fktw,t1_j77fgrb
I'm not as confident but I'm expecting a much more solid showing.,Liverpool,Yes,j76ie9l,t1_j76i8y4
"I think the general opinion on him will change soon enough. He wasn't anything special at Benfica, and e is nowhere near with the price he way bought for and just cannot shoot. 

His finishing has cost us plenty of points this season already as even if you defend poorly, a single well-timed goal can win you the game whether you ""deserved it"" or not. Pretty soon the chaos jokes will stop (I hope, at least). The real chaos in the squad is Gomez and the midfield.",Liverpool,Yes,j77g0pv,t1_j77ev8k
"Not at all. Both merseyside teams could be relegated this year. Last year we were 2 games away from the quadruple. Biggest fucking implosion in sports history if this happens. And the way we are playing, it very well could.",Liverpool,Yes,j78l58x,t1_j78kmrf
PSG and Salah rumours have been around every year I don‚Äôt see Mo leaving,Liverpool,Yes,j76gusp,t1_j76gocn
We had better sign them both so we can give them a proper comparison :),Liverpool,Yes,j76hvkr,t1_j76hmlg
Its pretty close in terms of current ability but Bellingham definetly beats him on potential,Liverpool,Yes,j76iqn7,t1_j76hmlg
Nah not shot we'd bin Klopp during the season not when FSG are leaving he's earned more than that,Liverpool,Yes,j77d4cv,t1_j77cxva
Fsg aren‚Äôt sacking him it will expose them as the new Mike Ashley in the league,Liverpool,Yes,j77d43q,t1_j77cxva

"The leagues probably the poorest it‚Äôs been in a Long time, arsenals luck has all came at once. Zinchenko is a tidy player but the praise for him has become a bit obscene, he‚Äôs a poor man‚Äôs younger Milner.",Liverpool,Yes,j76j2da,t1_j76hd3t
Rather city win the league than arsenal tbh,Liverpool,Yes,j76pbqr,t1_j76p6z1
"Seriously, Arsenal winning the league would be insufferable. I'd take a three year break from football if they did.",Liverpool,Yes,j76pflx,t1_j76p6z1
" Everyone including assna fans were hoping City ""saved football"" during our title race. Am I petty enough to do the same? Abso-fucking-lutely, that's what being a football fan is all about",Liverpool,Yes,j76s07b,t1_j76p6z1
And we will play who instead? It‚Äôs one thing saying we need to improve on these players but we are already short on midfield resources. Zero chance that Thiago and Keita will be fit until the end of the season,Liverpool,Yes,j76mrbn,t1_j76m1sl
I'll always support us but this is getting beyond trusting in Klopp we are an absolute mess,Liverpool,Yes,j76yneq,t1_j76y1cg
"It‚Äôs the wrong time, I wouldn‚Äôt bring up inspirational quotes while we‚Äôre shitting the bed against fucking Wolves",Liverpool,Yes,j76yrnj,t1_j76y1cg
"Football isn't the same as it was 60 years ago, lad. It's become a business and if we can't compete in that, we're done for. No miracle can save us.

>this sub is toxic af

I'm sure the boys down at the pub would cheers you on that who just wanna have fun on a weekend and don't care about the future of the club with a pint but you won't find that here.",Liverpool,Yes,j76yzf6,t1_j76y1cg
"This is the Liverpool daily discussion,  not Everton",Liverpool,Yes,j762j84,t1_j75soje
"If it helps, they‚Äôre actually dying inside when it happens",Liverpool,Yes,j76hozj,t1_j76h1fz
"that's not the problem though

city and arsenal score tons of goals like that

our midfielders don't seem to have the composure to that

keita bottled a golden chance",Liverpool,Yes,j774l4s,t1_j773wb4
We have midfielder at home,Liverpool,Yes,j76dubf,t1_j76de22
Bobby doesn‚Äôt have the legs for that lol,Liverpool,Yes,j76fhgb,t1_j76de22
"Why don‚Äôt we play Adrian at CDM, start that press early /s",Liverpool,Yes,j76fs9w,t1_j76de22
Onana nothing like Fabinho he‚Äôs fast and plays box to box completely different type of player,Liverpool,Yes,j76mfk4,t1_j76m9ei
Sell Trent. You need to simmer down love.,Liverpool,Yes,j77n6ur,t1_j77iw38
How you can watch that and single Thiago out is beyond me. Also drop him for who?,Liverpool,Yes,j77a0p5,t1_j7791a5
"Eh? No ones stopped ""supporting"" lad!

But being critical of this dirge and downing of tools, lack of investment is perfectly acceptable and natural. Ill edit that bit unnecessary.",Liverpool,Yes,j77bxwl,t1_j77aodj
he was loyal to players while we were good. when he first joined he happily binned 75% of the dross he had to take over. there‚Äôs no actual evidence that he won‚Äôt be ruthless,Liverpool,Yes,j77m77s,t1_j77iy71
Mate who cares. We aren't in a position to laugh at others you clown,Liverpool,Yes,j77hx1f,t1_j77hfav
"Could say the exact same for us, just change the digits",Liverpool,Yes,j77i82n,t1_j77hfav
"I‚Äôm curious, what would be your plan? You clearly don‚Äôt think we need incomings, you also think the staff are not the problem. You‚Äôre obviously obsessed with FSG so they‚Äôre not the problem. Why are we 10th if everything is perfect?",Liverpool,Yes,j77dyrw,t1_j77d45i
If there is nothing wrong with the club why have we conceded 9 goals in 2023 and have 1 point from 12?,Liverpool,Yes,j77eo92,t1_j77d45i
"I agree in principle but City are patchy by their standards also, it's Arsenal's to lose",Liverpool,Yes,j76ez0u,t1_j76evhj
"Let‚Äôs be real, our attack this season has mostly consisted of spamming crosses",Liverpool,Yes,j76hki8,t1_j76hco7
"Any manager we get will need reinvestment. 

FSG aren't able to do that, Klopp can't manage this team and therefore we need a relegation battling manager to help us survive. 

Guess bring in Harry Redknapp ü§™",Liverpool,Yes,j787eo2,t1_j77ok39
"Indeed we are, although it won't happen because FSG are too cheap to sack him. Plus they don't watch football or check the league standings until May.",Liverpool,Yes,j77x59r,t1_j77ok39
"Nah, the unbelievable part is that he ever went to Everton in the first place",Liverpool,Yes,j76f536,t1_j76eziv
üöÆ,Liverpool,Yes,j76zf5n,t1_j76z496
Whatever you've been doing is the best thing to happen to you today. Wish I had some work,Liverpool,Yes,j770sev,t1_j76z496
![gif](giphy|OH2rL6DVTNpte),Liverpool,Yes,j76zvxv,t1_j76z496
Nunez (70m) and Gakpo (40m) have absolutely stunk the gaff out and been significantly worse than the player we sold in summer.,Liverpool,Yes,j771gr8,t1_j770n8l
"This is a common theme this season, I can‚Äôt understand why we keep doing it.

It was so obvious Gomez just needed to cut the passing lane, it‚Äôs fairly sure it‚Äôs defending 101",Liverpool,Yes,j777g53,t1_j776n42
Annoyingly we're at Anfield too. If it was the Goodison leg it's always a draw anyway so I wouldn't be arsed.,Liverpool,Yes,j766hk0,t1_j7653ig
Very true,Liverpool,Yes,j76xuep,t1_j76xnrm
Hopefully he keep them in eternal 17th limbo. Would hate to see them going down. 17th is just perfect for them.,Liverpool,Yes,j76py00,t1_j76ppl5
Please don't bring his personal life into this when you don't know him like that,Liverpool,Yes,j77d827,t1_j77bq40
Fabinho was a big problem that has been partially fixed. That isn't to say he was the only problem and nobody has really even pretended otherwise.,Liverpool,Yes,j77f81o,t1_j77en7k
"Yeah. It feels like we‚Äôre to the point with Gomez and Matip that we were with fab a month ago. They‚Äôre showing us no reason why they should remain in the squad (especially Gomez) but Klopp is being stubborn. I expect this performance will be the last of Gomez starting for a while. But honestly, both of them deserve to be benched. 

Do we know how long Ibou is going to be out? Is it the famous LFC fortnight?",Liverpool,Yes,j77jb61,t1_j77gcrq
Anthony Gordon isnt the reason they are 3rd on the table,Liverpool,Yes,j77h29w,t1_j77gyld
"They did also sign Isak for over ¬£70m as well and he's played less than 10 games so far for them. They've spent a shitload and also used it wisely, spreading it across the entire squad and the bench too.",Liverpool,Yes,j77id6r,t1_j77gyld
Arteta is mad overrated and he‚Äôs just riding his luck at the moment. That‚Äôs a hill I‚Äôll die on,Liverpool,Yes,j76j6gm,t1_j76gzh1
"I don't think so ? Because he doesn't fund anything it's all club revenue. It was the sale of mane, Nico Williams, minamino ect",Liverpool,Yes,j77cah0,t1_j77bzvi
"I get the sarcasm lad but I do think two games against sides in the bottom 6 and one against a Newcastle team without Guimar√£es are winnable.

Plus a bit of optimism beats the depression when you come on here and look at the comments.",Liverpool,Yes,j760gzv,t1_j75y1gc
"Best I can do is 20 of the next 48. 

Unless I did the maths wrong, that's our current PL winrate.",Liverpool,Yes,j76cqg2,t1_j75y1gc
If he's in training this week with no setbacks he'll make the bench for the derby next week,Liverpool,Yes,j75z35j,t1_j75qfsm
"Occasionally you see people somehow still have faith in him. He's had a single good season and that was when Van Dijk and the midfield were at their height of physicality, making up for his braindead mistakes.",Liverpool,Yes,j77ipy7,t1_j77i2x7
Imagine being Salah getting paid out the ass to play like complete shit,Liverpool,Yes,j7788ur,t1_j772ivs
Yeah it's no excuse when you're on 400k a week but you look on the left wing earlier this season and you see....Ox with Hendo and Fabinho stinking it up in the midfield behind you it's understandable to some degree.,Liverpool,Yes,j773j5o,t1_j772ivs
">Salah has always been a goalscorer not a winger which is why I used to cringe when I saw Messi and Hazards comparisons. Salah can't hold a candle to that level of playmaking from wide

He was top assister in the PL last season, he can't even beat a man in 1v1 now like he used to.",Liverpool,Yes,j77es5w,t1_j77do4q
"Of course, well said. The team is completely burnt out and has to be practically rebuilt from the ground up.",Liverpool,Yes,j77xzj4,t1_j77j6u3
Scrappy 0-0 it is then,Liverpool,Yes,j76gngu,t1_j76gkdy
0% chance of them going down under dyche,Liverpool,Yes,j76gazf,t1_j76g410
He couldn‚Äôt leave in January anyway even if he wanted to had already played for two clubs this season,Liverpool,Yes,j76jvah,t1_j76jiin
I have no issues with Elliott playing but if he's going to play then play him on the right where he's far more comfortable. I'm sure you'll probably have something to say about Salah being dropped in that case though.,Liverpool,Yes,j7662sg,t1_j765mly
"He's only not started the last couple because he's been coming back from an injury, unless there's still injury concerns he starts today",Liverpool,Yes,j763ibt,t1_j75yrb5
Yep. And costs only for 15 millions for Napoli for Fulham.,Liverpool,Yes,j76l9qu,t1_j76l0jw

"> instead of strengthening the squad

Wonder how we paid for Gakpo then",Liverpool,Yes,j76ka9m,t1_j76jvw5
"I mean, I'd say we could have sustained it if we had made smart transfer decisions.",Liverpool,Yes,j77c0qa,t1_j77atpl
"I am indifferent because I don‚Äòt have any confidence whatsoever in our ownership. At least in 20/21 I felt like this was all just a matter of our CBs getting healthy (which it was). Now I feel like it‚Äòs a matter of needing a new CB to replace Matip or Gomez, a back-up RB, a new quality back-up goalkeeper because Kelleher should be allowed to leave, a Fabinho replacement & 3 new CMs. There‚Äòs no way on earth we‚Äòll do half of that in the summer with FSG.
I‚Äòm not asking for 90+ points every season and CL finals every other year, but we‚Äòre getting embarrassed by the worst teams in the league. There‚Äòs serious issues at the club.",Liverpool,Yes,j77bmdk,t1_j77atpl
"Not without backing you can‚Äôt.. This crisis was promised and had to happen with the current owner.

You want to see Klopp getting compared to Arteta? Fuck that dude.,Liverpool,Yes,j76sbvt,t1_j76rvln
"Still United for me, bunch of utter cunts",Liverpool,Yes,j76ky6k,t1_j76kqkf
Reading the match threads and you‚Äôd honestly think there‚Äôs a conspiracy against them the way they constantly talk about it. Really odd.,Liverpool,Yes,j76kpsl,t1_j76kkhq
"People are scared to admit it but it just seems to obvious at this point, changed the midfield and its still the same.

Down to him to chanage the system and we haven't done that either.",Liverpool,Yes,j76xnex,t1_j76xf3n
"Terrible take and tired of hearing this nonsense. Everton just beat Arsenal today, Klopp hasn‚Äôt won a game convincingly since Rangers",Liverpool,Yes,j77ep0f,t1_j77as1e
Accurately rating an above average player as above average is hate? Too many closeted arsana fans in here,Liverpool,Yes,j76kxte,t1_j76kcdu
"Mix between atmosphere and a team fighting for everything is really not easy to play against, we've seen it many times over the years but most of the time we found a way to win.",Liverpool,Yes,j76ljbj,t1_j76l9tk
There's plenty of games like this in a season. Play enough of them and eventually you'll drop points. I think people underestimate just how tight a lot of games are.,Liverpool,Yes,j76mnui,t1_j76l9tk
I can't believe how many people rather Arsenal not get the title than Everton get relegated.,Liverpool,Yes,j76ox5v,t1_j76mwm6
"The team we have been using is more than good enough to be playing much better than what we have been.

We're back to the 4-3-3 after it not working in the 1st half of the season and are no percistent on using while the results are still shit, at that point you need to look at the manager.,",Liverpool,Yes,j77472p,t1_j773yge
"Fair points, Jude and Pellegrini it is then!



If we were sticking to a younger bracket would you have any of Gravenberch, Jacob Ramsey, Caicedo or Mount?",Liverpool,Yes,j761s89,t1_j760kxj
"I've only seen Enzo Le Fee a handful of time but he did seem pretty good to be fair, Szobslai I know was meant to be Red Bulls next big thing but thought (maybe incorrectly) he played predominantly further forward?",Liverpool,Yes,j764ly4,t1_j7625ml
"In keeping with our grim-ish FSG reality, i think we'll sign Jude, and that's it..which is not enough for a title challenge next season.

I'd be shocked (and overjoyed) if we try for and get Rice. I'd love Tielemans on a free.

Once we land the key targets, squad depth can be built by a couple of HG players here and there. A HG keeper (let Adrian go), Gomez, Nat, Milner, Hendo, Kelleher, Trent, Curtis are what we expect to have. If we sell Kelleher, get another HG backup keeper..if we sell Nat, get someone from one of the newly relegated/promoted sides.",Liverpool,Yes,j76hslc,t1_j7675lt
Yup,Liverpool,Yes,j779mjd,t1_j75ywhy
Because they've just signed gomes and are struggling to score? If our midfield is so bad how are we challenging european spots? Theres more to a team than a midfield.,Liverpool,Yes,j76a9rj,t1_j769u3k
"That's why I said on paper because it's yet to be put in to practice. All 3 Neves, Gomes and Nunes are technically world class. You've got a box to box set piece specialist in Neves. A technically gifted destroyer in Gomes and a very creative player in Nunes. Not many teams have 3 that should compliment each other so well. Reminds me of our Mascherano, Alonso and Gerrard midfield. Wolves are only lacking in goals, once they figure out how to score they'll be challenging for Europe again easily.",Liverpool,Yes,j769oqs,t1_j767q4e
It's because you and your ilk say the same shite every single summer.,Liverpool,Yes,j77bf8d,t1_j77b5hk
"Nobody‚Äôs downvoted them so why you shadow boxing? Reality is FSG aren‚Äôt the ONLY reason, they‚Äôre a huge part but we‚Äôre playing like shit, that‚Äôs on Klopp and the players. We have money for Gakpo, did we need Gakpo? No we needed a midfielder. Everyone should be embarrassed",Liverpool,Yes,j77ckmu,t1_j77b5hk
Salah has entered the chat,Liverpool,Yes,j76hiah,t1_j76g9g2
"None of these lads actually think before they post, it's unreal.",Liverpool,Yes,j77doye,t1_j77dlmv
"for the fee we would have paid, <20m, he would have been a superb signing for the squad.",Liverpool,Yes,j76czhs,t1_j76ctfo
"The only thing Jones has going for him is his age.
Looked a bit in most competitive games, run into the corner and back pass, rinse and repeat",Liverpool,Yes,j76g2xz,t1_j76dugg
Onana and Iwobi gets into our midfield,Liverpool,Yes,j76e91k,t1_j76dn2g
"They're bottom of the table because they have no one who can score, not because of their midfield. 15 goals is a putrid output. Iwobi is only a winger right now, but he was a CM with Lampard and he and Onana bossed our midfield. That game was so frustrating to watch.",Liverpool,Yes,j76gehh,t1_j76dn2g
Legs are a talent too I guess,Liverpool,Yes,j76gp10,t1_j76ggvo
because them winning it is not an achievement.,Liverpool,Yes,j77198k,t1_j76totv
I know that. But some still show them‚Ä¶sneakily. I‚Äôm just not sure where anymore since having a fire stick is one of the worst crimes in this country currently.,Liverpool,Yes,j75xbrf,t1_j75wvap
"A CB could be huge, but I don‚Äôt think we get another one unless Matip is sold.
 
Another strict DM doesn‚Äôt come in unless Fab is sold either. Otherwise you‚Äôre basically killing Bajcetic‚Äôs route into the first team. 

A RW doesn‚Äôt come in unless you sell Salah, as Elliot, Jota, Diaz, Doak, and Gordon can all play there for the 8 games a so a season that Salah isn‚Äôt starting. 

There are only so many spaces in the squad. We will 100% need a few midfielders, but beyond that it would take quite a fire sale to free up all those spaces for extra investment.",Liverpool,Yes,j7664h4,t1_j75rhg2
People will look at this and thing you‚Äôre crazy. But this really is what is needed if we want to get back to competing for trophies. FSG let this squad decay so much that we now have to have a MASSIVE window in the summer.,Liverpool,Yes,j76c79t,t1_j75rhg2
Well we do hope FSG will be gone but i dont think it will happen so soon. I also dont think we will buy Jude. People on here spout his name like its a god given right for us to buy him! Its ridiculous how so many top clubs in this country including us let him go to Dortmund when every man and their dog knew Birmingham were gonna sell him. He is out of FSG‚Äôs price range. Can never see them spending ¬£100m plus on one player. Lets not forget the Darwin deal is only around ‚Ç¨80m with add-ons. I also wanna add that Klopp is an amazing coach and he has the ability to make a ¬£40m-¬£50m midfielder just as good as Jude. Klopp signed a new contract less than a year ago. He is here to stay and develop players. I belive we will buy outliers thst are not so expensive.,Liverpool,Yes,j75srl2,t1_j75rhg2
"No no, I mean genuine conversations and discussions with family or friends irl. From people that dont actively dislike the club.",Liverpool,Yes,j77jjpz,t1_j77inao

"Maybe I‚Äôve just failed to notice in the past, but they seem to be pushing more central in possession like a true cm rather than drifting inside.",Liverpool,Yes,j76e5fa,t1_j76dytq
"His passing is really good tbf. Lot of players do no look passing for the lulz, he actually does it effectively to make really clever vertical passes",Liverpool,Yes,j76lxvy,t1_j76lbxn
I just hate to see people turn on him. He's been the best Liverpool Manager in the prem era,Liverpool,Yes,j77fwud,t1_j77fktw
Presumably home games and VVD/Jota/Firmino will help us struggle to 12th or something but genuinely not sure where we go from here. Completely fucked it,Liverpool,Yes,j78o4ab,t1_j78l58x

"Yeah, my point is he‚Äôs got no composure what so ever, I‚Äôd literally prefer anyone there",Liverpool,Yes,j774p0j,t1_j774l4s
It's the tackling with long legs I'm talking about. Should have made it more clear.,Liverpool,Yes,j76mlbf,t1_j76mfk4
"We can bench him too. Yes, he has a killer pass in him, but if he cannot defend well, what is the point??",Liverpool,Yes,j77uhnb,t1_j77n6ur
"Hendo and Fab have been dropped of late, so don‚Äôt see Thiago deserves to keep starting. He has been utter poo of late but starts every game. Give Curtis and Ox a run out in the two 8‚Äôs. At least they will be fresh and bring energy to the table.",Liverpool,Yes,j78d6dk,t1_j77a0p5
">Eh? No ones stopped ""supporting"" lad!

Have you seen the reaction from the usual bottom reds?",Liverpool,Yes,j77c80w,t1_j77bxwl
"Get fucked, I laugh at us as a club as well.",Liverpool,Yes,j77icaa,t1_j77hx1f
"I mean you couldn't, but go off",Liverpool,Yes,j77jt0h,t1_j77i82n
nah Citeh are awake now. This sort of stretch is their domain. Look how they ripped Spurs apart,Liverpool,Yes,j76g5d5,t1_j76ez0u
I don‚Äôt think we have done enough of that this season. We barely create anymore,Liverpool,Yes,j76hq2q,t1_j76hki8
"Absolute wally. If he's not given the financial backing, what makes you think any other manager can change things?",Liverpool,Yes,j77yulr,t1_j77x59r
We are supposed to ease them out while relying on Diaz and Jota. This season is cursed.,Liverpool,Yes,j772lsx,t1_j771gr8
"I actually think Dyche with money gets them into European places eventually. They'll be limited by FFP for a while but if they stick with him, they'll go places. His football isn't as one-dimensional as it's perceived to be if he actually has decent personnel.",Liverpool,Yes,j76q4uc,t1_j76py00
"Haha fuck off mate, it's not some intrusion into his privacy, we're chatting on the internet and it's just an observation. Lost people in your life and had it affect you? I have. It's not some mark of shame against me. Grow up.",Liverpool,Yes,j77e1up,t1_j77d827
"What problem was fixed exactly? We were absolutely no better in midfield or the DM area today than at any other point in the season. I don‚Äôt think the problem is the DM anyway, I think it‚Äôs the selection of players we have in midfield. Literally no presence",Liverpool,Yes,j77fvd3,t1_j77f81o
"Right but to answer your original question; it's not ""smart spending"" it's *lucky* spending. Isak for 70m, Trippier for 12m.",Liverpool,Yes,j77lkyt,t1_j77h29w
"Yes, that's how football works for most clubs. You spend what you earn.",Liverpool,Yes,j77coej,t1_j77cah0
"I think Newcastle are genuinely way too good for us right now, they don‚Äôt need Guimaraes to look good still",Liverpool,Yes,j762999,t1_j760gzv
ü§û,Liverpool,Yes,j7672yx,t1_j75z35j
He‚Äôs been atrocious for a long time. Agreed.,Liverpool,Yes,j778nx0,t1_j7788ur
"I mean he never could consistently beat a man 1v1. He had flashes where he did but never in the same way other players do where it's either I get by you or you foul me, there's no other outcomes.",Liverpool,Yes,j77fx0q,t1_j77es5w
It‚Äôll be an end to end 0-0 as no one can hit the target at the moment,Liverpool,Yes,j76grvj,t1_j76gngu
There is absolutely a chance. They need goals out of someone.,Liverpool,Yes,j76hdxs,t1_j76gazf
And a <0% they‚Äôd sell to us anyway,Liverpool,Yes,j76jjql,t1_j76gazf
"I‚Äôd drop Salah and put Elliot on the right personally, play Nunez on the left, but I do not think that that is what Klopp will do.",Liverpool,Yes,j767lbh,t1_j7662sg
Yeah probably I wouldnt start him though,Liverpool,Yes,j763lom,t1_j763ibt
It's sad how bad our recruitment has become.,Liverpool,Yes,j76ljtr,t1_j76l9qu
"He's bargain, considering his last 1,5 years in PSV. It's not that hard. Same with Diaz last winter",Liverpool,Yes,j76lic6,t1_j76ka9m
"You've been following us for 15 years, you were there under H+G and THIS is when you're most indifferent and have no confidence in the ownership? Right after a fantastic couple of years where we've had a fantastic time as fans? 

I'm sceptical.",Liverpool,Yes,j77bxqq,t1_j77bmdk
">Not without backing you can‚Äôt.. This crisis was promised and had to happen with the current owner.  
>  
>Could‚Äôve been a dynasty ‚Ä¶

We have one of the biggest wage bills in world football and have spent 200m in attacking players in the past two seasons while spending 0m on midfield.",Liverpool,Yes,j77casu,t1_j77bv2i
Gotta agree. United and Chelsea are much worse IMO,Liverpool,Yes,j76ldyq,t1_j76ky6k
They're cunts but Arsenal fans on Twitter especially are unmatched in delusion,Liverpool,Yes,j76l6z0,t1_j76ky6k
"I‚Äôm absolutely not into calling for a manager‚Äôs head, but this reality cannot be off limits for our fan base. It‚Äôs like so many are lying to themselves",Liverpool,Yes,j76y3pi,t1_j76xnex
I‚Äôm not disagreeing I‚Äôm asking for a realistic name,Liverpool,Yes,j77flsj,t1_j77ep0f
Yea because saying a rival player is good is being a closeted Arsenal fan? Get your head out of your ass you tribal bum.,Liverpool,Yes,j76l44x,t1_j76kxte
Everton deserve to be in front they have been by far the better team today,Liverpool,Yes,j76n068,t1_j76mnui
I‚Äôd have any of those in a heartbeat but I‚Äôm not so sure about Mount. He‚Äôs been amazing in previous seasons but this season he‚Äôs been terrible,Liverpool,Yes,j762wvs,t1_j761s89
"If Bellingham played holding midfield, I reckon just his signing would be enough for us to get top 4, provided we have no European football at all next year. Given he's not we may struggle if Bajcetic isn't up to the job. Bellingham plus Rice though I think genuinely puts us as title challengers.

We're really not as far off as some on here would have us believe. Our squad at the moment is inflated because we've got so many players who can't stay fit. If we can bring in two good options as holding midfield and the right side of midfield we'll have a top class first team. As you say there's then some surgery to be done lower down the squad ladder, but with Kelleher and Phillips out we can probably offset our costs of doing that pretty well. I'm also optimistic Ramsey will come good next year, so really the only work that needs doing is in centre midfield, centre half, and goalkeeper.",Liverpool,Yes,j76kb8o,t1_j76hslc
üò≠,Liverpool,Yes,j77iqtr,t1_j779mjd
"Well, yes. You can't stand still in football or other teams will leave you behind.",Liverpool,Yes,j77bsgs,t1_j77bf8d
"Anyone with half a brain cell could see this happening 
Funny how you actually labelled yourself top red by replying",Liverpool,Yes,j77bzow,t1_j77bf8d
"so whose fault is our downfall?

Weird that armchair managers here seen it coming for ages hmmm",Liverpool,Yes,j77cw8c,t1_j77bf8d
"A club with our recorded revenue shouldn‚Äôt have to choose between Gakpo or a midfielder? The Lynch article the other day mentioned debt repayment being made the priority over transfer funds, hence Klopp is only allowed to address one weakness.",Liverpool,Yes,j77de1c,t1_j77ckmu
We needed a forward and a midfielder.,Liverpool,Yes,j77dz0m,t1_j77ckmu
They were being downvoted earlier your too late the sane people balanced it out,Liverpool,Yes,j77da7p,t1_j77ckmu
"yup, my comment was actually sarcastic.",Liverpool,Yes,j76g9bm,t1_j76g2xz
"Absolutely not. I'd have Thiago and Keita over them any day. The table doesn't lie, Everton arent some dynamic midfield that are being let down by poor finishing/defending. They're disjointed all over the pitch",Liverpool,Yes,j76eef7,t1_j76e91k
Some of you lot are so so weird. Someone other than city winning it as underdogs is better for football I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôd want that shower winning it.,Liverpool,Yes,j771h4e,t1_j77198k
"Ahhh really? Didn‚Äôt know that, apologies. I‚Äôd be shocked that they would risk it to be fair.",Liverpool,Yes,j75xegy,t1_j75xbrf
Nobody ‚Äúlet‚Äù him go to dortmund. He chose dortmund because it was the best place for his development. He even took less money because that‚Äôs where they felt would be the best step for his career. He turned down multiple clubs in favour of it.,Liverpool,Yes,j75twgv,t1_j75srl2
"What they're referring to, and what you're referring to, are different things.

Zinchenko is playing very much like a second 6 in possession, you're right; Gabriel is outside him. It makes their formation a bit 'WM', rather than the Pep 'WW'.",Liverpool,Yes,j76g7zw,t1_j76edrg
Trents always done that to some extent,Liverpool,Yes,j76eww9,t1_j76e5fa
People here are turning on a new player/staff after every game. It was fabinho‚Äôs turn but he wasn‚Äôt in the lineup so they need to find someone else,Liverpool,Yes,j77gbhp,t1_j77fwud
Pity it wasn‚Äôt actual wolves we played today üòÇ,Liverpool,Yes,j780752,t1_j77yvok
Well yeah that would be interesting to see Curtis ahead of Hendo and fab for a few weeks. Milner I don‚Äôt think is any better than Hendo or Fabinho in midfield nowadays,Liverpool,Yes,j76nlhr,t1_j76n2np
"We can support Klopp/the club, whilst also calling out what is wrong and what people want to change. They aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive.",Liverpool,Yes,j76z7ze,t1_j76yszi
There isn't one but at the same time are we supposed to just keep free falling? we aren't even playing like a mid table team at the minute.,Liverpool,Yes,j76zck4,t1_j76yszi
">who want dirt money and don‚Äôt care about the history of the club

FSG literally ate all of our UCL, PL money and furloughed our staff until they realised it's not good for their social status so they reverted it.

If we just ran the club on ticket sales, marketing, video rights, subscriptions, shirt sales and transfers, we'd have more transfer money than what FSG provided.

Our owners are literally leeching us off of your own club.",Liverpool,Yes,j76zvve,t1_j76zbss
That's a pretty weird take man,Liverpool,Yes,j76l3a8,t1_j76kjjo
I guess you focused more on rinsing fab than making your point!,Liverpool,Yes,j76n8bf,t1_j76mlbf
"Also his passes are pointless if nobody is running on the other end of them.

We should seriously just play a low block and shithouse with Darwin up top but it's just not in Jurgen's DNA to do that so we'll just keep getting smashed every week",Liverpool,Yes,j77xoc9,t1_j77uhnb
Curtis and ox üòÇüòÇüòÇ,Liverpool,Yes,j7a1xfz,t1_j78d6dk
"Ah ignore them.

We're hurting.

This is unheard of what's happening right now. I can't think of anything like this in a top league for a long long time.

Especially when keeping pretty much a whole team together. The lessons in that maybe. Plus injuries, a big change in tactics. Mistakes have definitely occurred.",Liverpool,Yes,j77dsys,t1_j77c80w
"You're welcome to try and have a laugh at other clubs, but it's quite ironic how you can't see what you've written could be copy pasted for our current situation",Liverpool,Yes,j77jz2l,t1_j77jt0h
One can only hope,Liverpool,Yes,j76g7v8,t1_j76g5d5
"Look at how the team has fallen off, they‚Äôve stopped playing for him. 3 -0 to 18th place Wolves? Nearly the entire team needs to be overhauled, not just the manager.

It‚Äôs not easy to say these things and I don‚Äôt want Jurgen to leave but the situation is dire to say the least.",Liverpool,Yes,j78ox6s,t1_j77yulr
"You don't ""ease in"" players you sign for those fees when you're a replacement for a lad who played 50+ games and has been instrumental in what we've done for the past few years.",Liverpool,Yes,j7735zf,t1_j772lsx
"You're crazy if you think we haven't fixed the problem we had with Fabinho. Yes, Thiago was awful and Keita wasn't much better. But Bajcetic imo had the best performance any player has had at DM for us all season. 

If he starts playing like this regularly by the end of the season I'm comfortable with us going into next season with him as our first choice DM.",Liverpool,Yes,j77glxd,t1_j77fvd3
"Onana and Palhinha both costed less than that and there's other players out there we could get for less who could be really good.

Its not just ""FSG not giving money"" Klopp clearly only wants certain players.",Liverpool,Yes,j76lwjb,t1_j76lic6
"You can be, all I know is there was no way for anyone to ever get that fire out of me, bankruptcy or not, no matter how shit we were and my god, we were unwatchable the last few months of these two pricks. But the way modern football has evolved and our refusal to adapt has gotten me to think that we were lucky to have the last 5 years we‚Äôve had, now it might be back to being the underdog.

To me it feels like we went from financially irresponsible owners who were looking to make money off of us to financially responsible owners who are in it purely for the money.
Anfield is dead, the squad is in desperate need of a rebuild and they don‚Äòt give a flying fuck because their pockets are filled.",Liverpool,Yes,j77e2wm,t1_j77bxqq
"Yes, so does that make FSG or Klopp the problem?",Liverpool,Yes,j77cmio,t1_j77casu
"Irrelevant. Wages being high is the price you pay. It's Irrelevant because this place and you incluced would have a meltdown if we let our players go instead of extending when they were 6 out of 11 of the World XI and they were on mid table team wages. 

200 mil on attackers? What 4 players ? To play in a front 3? Let's see in these past seasons how much attacking depth was sold to fund 4 attackers. So say we bought midfielders with that 200 mil, it would be Salah and the academy attack upfront and academy on the bench. Thus just shifting the problem to a different department.",Liverpool,Yes,j77k8l1,t1_j77casu
"I'd take deluded over the specific brand of smug toxicity thats fairly unique to United, Chelsea and Real fans",Liverpool,Yes,j76lmul,t1_j76l6z0
Doesn‚Äôt need to be a big name. I would try and poach someone from Arteta or Guardiolas back room because clearly that style of play suits the premier league,Liverpool,Yes,j77m49d,t1_j77flsj
They've played really well for sure. Even on the ball they don't look half bad at all.,Liverpool,Yes,j76ne97,t1_j76n068
"The thing is when Mount is on it, he's fucking quality. He's having a poor season, but he's young and Trent has also been suffering after being a standout player  for us in previous years. 

I think Klopp of all people could really get the best out of him, and with this new ownership culling players I don't think Chelsea would be too against letting him leave.",Liverpool,Yes,j7691co,t1_j762wvs
"Yeah, with Jude and Rice, we should be back up close to the top, but unlikely those 2 are executed with FSG in charge. I also think that for a real title push, we'll need a CB addition. So 3 signings required, while FSG will sanction 1..and the only way we make do with that is not have Europa league to deal with and have a season goal of top 4 only",Liverpool,Yes,j76ooat,t1_j76kb8o
To be fair they only scored goals because of how poor we defended.,Liverpool,Yes,j77j4m6,t1_j77iqtr
"We didn't stand still, we signed a striker for 70m and we spent the entire summer trying to get the lad who went to Real to join us instead. Nunez has been a flop and we didn't have an alternative in midfield. How is that because of FSG?",Liverpool,Yes,j77chjm,t1_j77bsgs
"Yes, anyone with half a brain cell could see a team that went within 90 minutes of a quadruple dropping off to this level. You are very very smart and are definitely self aware.",Liverpool,Yes,j77c5oe,t1_j77bzow
"We never refreshed the squad 
You‚Äôre supposed to slowly do it over windows 
Not gaslight fans with ‚Äúnext summer‚Äù ‚Äúwarchest ‚Äú buzz words whenever it‚Äôs time to renew tickets",Liverpool,Yes,j77dggn,t1_j77cw8c
They say it every single season.,Liverpool,Yes,j77dbz4,t1_j77cw8c
so that‚Äôs a woooosh for me lol,Liverpool,Yes,j76ge29,t1_j76g9bm
Onana is far better than keita that‚Äôs just fact,Liverpool,Yes,j76jnnn,t1_j76eef7
Are you watching the game? They could be 2-0 up and are all over Arsenal in the midfield area. It‚Äôll probably fall apart for them soon though,Liverpool,Yes,j76gix3,t1_j76eef7
I‚Äôd have Thiago over them for sure but I‚Äôm taking Onana over Bajcetic,Liverpool,Yes,j76fptu,t1_j76eef7
"oh, i'm not on that Arsenal hate train myself, i just wanted to explain why a lot do.",Liverpool,Yes,j772ezt,t1_j771h4e
"milner atleast tries hendo deadass just runs around doing nothing and fabinho plays on 700 ping, we will have to survive until the summer when hopefully fsg are gone.",Liverpool,Yes,j76o1dd,t1_j76nlhr
I don't think it is but nothing surprises me in this sub,Liverpool,Yes,j76yu73,t1_j76l3a8
"Yeah last week left a bitter taste in my mouth. Box-to-box or destroyer, you have to tackle as a midfielder anyway lol. Not sure why you are getting this defensive when he has been dropping stinkers the whole season.",Liverpool,Yes,j76nts6,t1_j76n8bf
Hope Jurgen try a Mourinho tactics but that is not Jurgen way aye. Problem now is that we are crap on defense and offense too,Liverpool,Yes,j77zdx2,t1_j77xoc9
"You laugh, but why does Thiago deserve to start over Hendo and Fab? At this point, I‚Äôd rather have players playing who don‚Äôt look shot of confidence! Thiago even came out and said it‚Äôs a mentality issue/hang over from last season recently. And if he is also suffering, then taking him out of the lime light got a game or two isn‚Äôt going to help. 

He isn‚Äôt being singled out as you suggest. We had plenty wrong with us today, I do have eyes my friend.",Liverpool,Yes,j7afv3c,t1_j7a1xfz
"I laugh at us as well, but West Ham and us are totally different.",Liverpool,Yes,j77k55z,t1_j77jz2l
Why? You'd think a man as staunchly against human rights abusers as you are wouldn't want one of their clubs to win titles over a normal side such as Arsenal. A bit hypocritical.,Liverpool,Yes,j76ijr6,t1_j76g7v8
So you aren‚Äôt able to tell me what problem was fixed? But also I‚Äôm crazy if I can‚Äôt see it? Didn‚Äôt we just lose 3-0 or did I miss something,Liverpool,Yes,j77j9pi,t1_j77glxd
"Yeah, totally on Klopp. He clearly doesn't want someone instead of Ox or Keita or Arthur.",Liverpool,Yes,j76m42d,t1_j76lwjb
"People are slagging FSG because they're too cowardly to have a go at Klopp. It's the same with Pep. FSG are supportive, they don't take money out of the club, they've given Klopp the control.",Liverpool,Yes,j77dmcb,t1_j77cmio
">Irrelevant. Wages being high is the price you pay. 

It isn't irrelevant at all. It effects the money you can spend else where. We're spending 150m more in wages than Spurs or Arsenal.",Liverpool,Yes,j78do9n,t1_j77k8l1
As the assistant? As the manager your off your rocker but to replace linders I‚Äôd agree,Liverpool,Yes,j77nhud,t1_j77m49d
Couldn‚Äôt have waited until we played them to sack Lampard,Liverpool,Yes,j76nm7r,t1_j76ne97
"-Sitting on their hands rather than getting someone who'd actually help after the CL win

-Throwing away 20/21 by not getting a CB

-Waiting until winter to get Diaz

-Waiting for Bellingham, who is not guaranteed to come and won't solve our biggest issue, instead of getting someone else when Tchouameni went to Madrid

-*Still* haven't replaced Gini

-Didn't bring in a midfielder in winter despite us getting beaten there in all but about 3 games.",Liverpool,Yes,j77d42q,t1_j77chjm
"Anyone could see having some of the oldest players in the league would cost us in an energetic high intensity league ? Yes obviously 
We need a whole new spine 
We needs 5 midfielders 2 new cbs ,backup rb and a salah backup 
You see fsg giving klopp 100s of millions to buy them ? Because teams will rinse us knowing the state we are in",Liverpool,Yes,j77cqpa,t1_j77c5oe
"Anyone with half a brain could see that we were 90 minutes from the quad despite our midfield, yes.",Liverpool,Yes,j77ch7z,t1_j77c5oe
It happens every time we pick up injuries. Milner comes into midfield for a few games and then we‚Äôre all sat here wanting Henderson to come back. Neither players are ideal imo,Liverpool,Yes,j76oo0d,t1_j76o1dd
Just bored reading Fabinho is shit comments. For the record I agree with you about the leggy tackling but your point didn‚Äôt come through initially,Liverpool,Yes,j76ocw6,t1_j76nts6
"Hendo and Fab have played 53 games between them this season and been shite in every single one. Ox has played enough to know he isn‚Äôt good enough. Jones is an awful footballer. Thiago hasn‚Äôt been up to his high standards 100% but he hasn‚Äôt been bad enough for him to be dropped for the likes of Jones and Ox. Even keita looks absolutely horrendous every game. We don‚Äôt have players capable of taking his place. 

No one should be immune from being dropped but we just don‚Äôt have the quality to replace him. It‚Äôs the same with Salah. He‚Äôs been shite all season but who‚Äôs gonna come in and take his place?",Liverpool,Yes,j7az0ko,t1_j7afv3c
"First of all, I'm flattered! Second, when it comes to who owns us you're absolutely correct. Couldn't really give a shit who wins the title if it isn't us, but if that's the choice from the rest of the pack then City is the less annoying option.",Liverpool,Yes,j76lz9n,t1_j76ijr6
"Okay, the problem that we fixed was having a slow, immobile DM who couldn't tackle to save his life. He was of course not the only problem, but he was a huge one.

Now, instead of him, we have a young, agile DM with tenacity and good pressing that must have made at least 5 successful tackles today.

> Didn‚Äôt we just lose 3-0 or did I miss something

It's possible for players to be good even in a heavy loss, you know that right? And the problems we had today are completely different from what we've suffered all season.",Liverpool,Yes,j77jq6n,t1_j77j9pi
"Then why are the only reliable reports been about players like Bellingham, Caicedo and Tchouamei when he was at Monaco? pretty clear pattern there",Liverpool,Yes,j76ndqy,t1_j76m42d
"Klopp is to loyal to certain players for sure but he‚Äôs not the one that dictates the amount available for transfers. I think FSG knows how good of a manager he is and tried riding the magic wave without putting in much effort for themselves. 

Stadium expansions pays itself over the course of some years. The clubs income is sky high and reaches new heights every year but somehow we‚Äôve got no money to spend? Sounds greedy and cowardly to me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",Liverpool,Yes,j77gjse,t1_j77dmcb
"Trent, Robbo, VVD, Alisson, Matip, Fabinho. All signed contract extensions in the last couple seasons. Should the club have let them go or retained the best players in the world at the time? Simple question that makes wages irrelevant. A top club in the world should not be choosing between wages and transfers. In fact I don't think any other big club in the world has this problem. Only Liverpool.",Liverpool,Yes,j78u6eg,t1_j78do9n
We have one of the biggest wages in world football. We've spent over 200m on attacking players since Wijnaldum left. FSG are not in charge of buying players. When will you understand this?,Liverpool,Yes,j77da1k,t1_j77d42q
">We needs 5 midfielders 2 new cbs ,backup rb and a salah backup

My brain.",Liverpool,Yes,j77dgpd,t1_j77cqpa
">Anyone with half a brain could see that we were 90 minutes from the quad despite our midfield, yes.

90+ point season, two trophies, a CL final. Another very intelligent person.",Liverpool,Yes,j77cm61,t1_j77ch7z
"So a hypocrite, yeah. Not surprised.",Liverpool,Yes,j76n4b1,t1_j76lz9n
"The only reason we want our DM sprinting around the pitch is because we have no shape or balance in the midfield. For the time being yes it makes sense to have some mobility in that position so fair enough I understand your point, but it‚Äôs crazy to think we can rescue this season with Stefan DM and nothing else. It‚Äôs not going to make the slightest bit of difference whether Stef plays or Fab plays, the biggest problem is coming from elsewhere",Liverpool,Yes,j77ke93,t1_j77jq6n
"Everyone is interested in Bellingham and Caicedo. It's easy clicks for press, and easy PR for FSG. Just like last day bid for Valverde. Tchouameni agreed to move to Real in April.",Liverpool,Yes,j76o8o3,t1_j76ndqy

">A top club in the world should not be choosing between wages and transfers. In fact I don't think any other big club in the world has this problem.

Not remotely true. United have just capped their salaries and let Ronaldo leave on a free. Barcelona have to reduce their wage bill by hundreds of millions. Real sold Casemiro partly because of his wage demands. New FFP rules are coming in.",Liverpool,Yes,j78upwg,t1_j78u6eg
"> We've spent over 200m on attacking players since Wijnaldum left.

"Uhhhh. If Ronaldo doesn't do his interview he is still at United? United still have multiple players over 200k. Martial earning more than every player at Liverpool bar Salah. 

Madrid replaced Casemerio and if his wage demands were too high, he still transferred to Utd who must have paid an equivalent salary. Replaced Varane and had United pay those wages.

Barca has almost nothing to do with choosing wages but the transfers themselves. The problem was signing multiple players on over 400k, players not accepting pay cuts during covid and then wanting to replace them because they turned out bad. No one wanted to buy them and players didn't wanna leave in transfers that would reduce their wages. Essential if Barca could sell those players and get new they wanted, they wouldn't have a problem. Instead they had unwanted players, who refused pay cuts during Covid, who they couldn't sell

All of these clubs have done transfers and signed players on high wages as opposed to Liverpool where our top earners all earned their high contracts.  
Example being Trent and Robbo combined being a 100k. They are both now on over 100k each. Which they've earned.

We all know the club is in a precarious, uncertain position, but I still don't doubt Klopp has the joy and passion within him to keep going and get this team clicking again. Been a lot of chat about him being burnt out, and while he definitely has seemed tired and defensive at points this campaign, I believe he is very motivated by specific challenges and doesn't pity himself or shy away from them. That's what you need in tough times - though obviously the results need to start matching the rhetoric. 

My feeling a renewed sense of calm, patience, and confidence in Klopp only fuels my frustration with the past two transfer windows however.

Literally none of us want to end up like Chelsea where our entire squad is thrown out of rhythm after making 30+ signings, and we don't even want to sign a gazillion players in one window, we just want our midfield to be refreshed time and time again.

"It's hard for people to be angry and think coherently about a wider range of issues all at once. It usually requires people to calm down and read, or listen to opinions outside their own head. This all requires effort. And nuance. And an ego willing to accept that it doesn't already know everything. And these things are rare, particuarly when so much of the response in football in very primitive ego triggering in the first place.

For example: we shit on FSG because they haven't even spent as much money as Spurs! Spurs for christ-sake! And then Spurs fans shit on Levy because he hasn't spent as much as Arsenal! Arsenal for christ-sake! And for now Arsenal are calm because they're winning - but plenty of their fans were calling for Arteta's head 18 months ago. And raging at the owners because they hadn't spent as much as United! The point being, its this constant egoic battle of someone else having more, so you feel like less. Someone else has more points, spends more money, has a squad closer to the peak of their ability -- and therefore you feel like less. And when you feel like less, what do you do? Do you offer compassion and consideration out into the world in recognition that all of this pining and whining after things you have no control over is somewhat absurd? Do you consider that every team in every sport goes through transitions and this team has offered almost nothing but quality and success for 6 years, and they deserve a bit of slack while the restructuring occurs? Or do you reflect that perhaps, above it all, you're too easily triggered by things that on the grand scale of life aren't that important, and that perhaps you should reflect on what you could do to stop flying off the handle so much or to reduce the feeling of impotent rage inside you? Do you accept personal responsibility for your own anger? Or do you simply allow yourself to be swept up by this indignant rage that you - a LIVERPOOL FAN - are being taken for a ride by these cheapskate, pieces of shit that won't spend as much as 'x' team, that have let the squad get to this 'state'? And who is in control of all this spending? I don't know! But who owns the club! FSG! FSG? Too amorphos! I need a man's face in my head, I need an external totem to blame all my feelings of insecurity and lack on! Who have we seen the most of - John Henry! It's his fault!! What an old, uncaring, piece of shit billionnaire he is. If only he left, then I could get all the things I want in life for Liverpool with any-other-billionaire in their stead. Because of course: gross over-simplification of the problem only works if you also grossly-oversimplify the solution.

Bill Shankly once said: if you can't support us when we lose, don't support us when we win. Or something like that. The idea being that supporting a club was about togetherness, unity - walking through a storm, you might say, together. There was an idea at Liverpool that you supported the team and the manager through everything, that yes you could be critical, but in a constructive way, and that ultimately you recognised that you were but a small, insignificant voice - but that if you had any power in the world as a Liverpool fan, it was the power to add your own positivity to that positive swell of the crowd that might drive the team on. 

Now, the modern fan feels like everything is an affront to them, personally. Their over-inflated egos have an expectation attached to their support: it's more like, if you can't win for me when I have taken the time to support you, don't even bother showing your face tomorrow because I will scream bloody-rage into it. Every loss is like a slap in their face. 

And so much of it is down to 'banter' culture too I feel; oh I shit all over United fans when they were doing poorly, which made me feel good about myself in comparison, but now that United fans are shitting on me and my team, it makes me feel like shit, and I don't even want to go into the office tomorrow because I can already see all the jackel faces just waiting to shit-grin in my face like I shit-grinned in theirs etc etc. So I must re-direct my anger at feeling like shit at someone -- so I'll redirect it at my own team! Or other simple targets, as mentioned. 

The thing I find most curious about it all is recognising that nobody abuses a club, its owners, its players or its managers now more than the people who claim to 'support' them. The single greatest potential the modern fan-base has is to be a toxic online presence that depresses everyone, and potentially threatens and alienates actually talented people from the club. In the past, the fans were those people most loyal, most willing to turn up and use their energy positively to try to affect positive change. Now, 90% of online fans are toxic, over-entitled know-it-alls whose key agenda seems to be to hone in on individual humans with the sole intent of spreading their own misery and lack of self-worth into their soul, almost as if it's all a game of reflection and deflection: I will love you and name my baby after you when you make me feel good; I will DM you to kill yourself when you make me feel bad. 

TL;DR: I should actually do some work today or I'm going to be fired. Oh, and people just like an easy answer to complex issues. And a single, human-shaped figure to blame is easier again than an amorphos corporation.",Liverpool,Yes,j719zv1,t1_j713xl9

I dont feel bad at all. Chelsea overpaid. Benfica was not going to negotiate with any club outside of that release clause,Liverpool,Yes,j73kxjb,t1_j73j42v
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd work as a 6 in Klopp‚Äôs system tbh. I think he‚Äôd be better as an 8,Liverpool,Yes,j73k5bh,t1_j73j42v
"Alisson, Trent, Konate, Virg, Robbo, Thiago, Salah, Diaz. Jota and Nunez as well would just depend on what style of play you'd want to start with",Liverpool,Yes,j710x5z,t1_j70s03j
"Alison, Trent, VVD, Konate, Robertson, Salah, Nunez Diaz

8 players",Liverpool,Yes,j70zkn6,t1_j70s03j
9 I would say. Everyone bar Fab and the RCM.,Liverpool,Yes,j70s56w,t1_j70s03j
"8/9. IMO the rebuild needed isn‚Äôt that extreme. We need to bring in decent backups in a couple positions but only 2, maybe 3 (depending on Thiago) sure starters in MF. The rest we bring in can have time to be eased in slower.",Liverpool,Yes,j70yvw8,t1_j70s03j
"Alisson, Trent, Ibou, VVD, DIaz",Liverpool,Yes,j7122k8,t1_j70s03j

"Hmm gk,front 3 positions are fine, midfield none bar mabye thiago rotationally, back 4 is fine

It‚Äôs the midfield we need a brand new spine in there and a new cb if konate is another matip",Liverpool,Yes,j71jdfs,t1_j70s03j
i remember hearing something about a disagreement between his parents and the coaching staff but i don't remember exactly what it was about. maybe they're being careful with him because i think he was injured for a while.,Liverpool,Yes,j734qly,t1_j72yodh
"Seems like a bit of a one trick poney, really good dribbling but everything else lacks especially physically.

"Space jammed is the only reasonable explanation at this stage üòÇ
It‚Äôs frightening",Liverpool,Yes,j71h3iv,t1_j71gtxq
"The extension of mediocrity has ruined it for players that are actually good. He‚Äôs been run into the ground and is now burnt out. The management of him by club, Klopp and FSG has been awful.",Liverpool,Yes,j71jd1i,t1_j71gtxq
I think the heartbreak of missing a quadruple by 2 games really just broke him (among a few other players it seems),Liverpool,Yes,j71wbht,t1_j71gtxq
Did anyone really think Martinelli was coming after Klopp praised him? I never got that impression.,Liverpool,Yes,j71duys,t1_j71dcnb
Bellingham ain‚Äôt coming imo. At this point if he comes he probably is either a masochist or has a huge saviour  complex,Liverpool,Yes,j71g8kx,t1_j71dcnb

"Klopp has decided the best role for Gakpo is as a Bobby replacement, he has alluded to it a few times in his press conferences so don't think it's time to question Klopp when he plays him in that role.",Liverpool,Yes,j74e82c,t1_j74bmxc
Nunez played 20 games last season for Benfica on the wings. Its not like he never plays there and Gakpo had a good WC playing as a CF. It it happens I don't see it being a controversial tactic and they would just be switching positions throughout the game,Liverpool,Yes,j74d3e7,t1_j74bmxc
"Well,  Nunes LW > Gapko LW/Nunes CF and Gapko pressing CF > Nunes pressing CF imo.",Liverpool,Yes,j74ciox,t1_j74bmxc
"Played 100 mins against City right after coming back from injury, probably should have been subbed sooner but the stoppage time just went on and on, intense game. Pulled his calf(?) right after he kicked about a min left in the game",Liverpool,Yes,j723f2f,t1_j722z1k
"Initially did his hamstring in the absolute waste of space Nations League, then there was a recurrence in the season",Liverpool,Yes,j724qo5,t1_j722z1k
I really hope we don't extend him. He's an amazing lad and has actually been pretty okay when he's played this season but our midfield is incredibly old and stale. We should be replacing him with a much younger player on lower wages.,Liverpool,Yes,j71d00z,t1_j71b562
"I‚Äôm sorry but no, this is exactly the kind of sentiment that ended us up where we are now. 

I last saw Liverpool play live five years ago. An entire pandemic later we still have a large core of the squad unchanged. We need to replace our aging players and not keep them on out of nostalgia.",Liverpool,Yes,j71gdpf,t1_j71b562
We drew tho,Liverpool,Yes,j73r95n,t1_j73qdqg
With the way the market is now Fulham would likely want 50m+ for him. There‚Äôs no way we spend that on someone who turns 28 in the summer,Liverpool,Yes,j73rmne,t1_j73qvqt

"Losing the league was bigger, for me.

Villa being 2-0 up gave me the first genuine bit of belief that we‚Äôd win the league that I‚Äôd had in ages. And then it was snatched away in 5 minutes.

"I get what you're saying, but what we need is quality not quantity.

We have fit midfielders but they aren't first team quality anymore",Liverpool,Yes,j71a73n,t1_j719py8
He'd *be* one of the injury gaps. It's why he hasn't really progressed in the last 5 years.,Liverpool,Yes,j71b85n,t1_j719py8
"If he was happy to take a squad role similar to Ox then it would probably be worth a punt. The kind of player that Klopp could rejuvenate, and has only just turned 27.

Injury record isn't terrible since 18/19, where he was out all season.",Liverpool,Yes,j71aaz9,t1_j719py8
"Honestly, I think he's the perfect Klopp signing.  Totally agree with you, apart from the fact he is made of broken digestives and breadcrumbs.",Liverpool,Yes,j71ba1n,t1_j719py8
Had the impression he was fairly injury-prone himself.,Liverpool,Yes,j71aovt,t1_j719py8
Your crazy about Thiago. If it wasn't for him our whole midfield would be even more shambolic.,Liverpool,Yes,j70zvgq,t1_j70zawg
"honestly its Salah who has been shit and Nunez is at least playing like he gives a shit in the game unlike others.

Also your mad to think Thiago isn't class",Liverpool,Yes,j710pt8,t1_j70zawg
"Thiago is not only world class, he‚Äôs one of our best players.",Liverpool,Yes,j712a77,t1_j70zawg
"What are you smoking bruh, thiago is the one and only person holding our midfield functioning this season",Liverpool,Yes,j71gqss,t1_j70zawg
"> Thiago would be world class but he's not, he can't change a game like KDB or Gerrard.

He absolutely can, but not even he or KDB could carry the most important position of the pitch next to 2 invalids. And VVD is probably not world class anymore either.",Liverpool,Yes,j7102cz,t1_j70zawg
"Well, but if Gallagher put in his exact performance nobody would think much of it hes just been solid",Liverpool,Yes,j73v2tb,t1_j73uuuj
He was ok. Gave away the ball multiple times though.,Liverpool,Yes,j73vfm7,t1_j73uuuj
"Playing well, looks like a ball playing box to boxer, very good positionally, has play maker vibes sits in the middle operating between defence and midfield, gets forward when he can, keeps it simple and looks like your probably not going to get the ball off him too easily.
He'd be top in a Liverpool shirt tbh.",Liverpool,Yes,j73vok3,t1_j73uuuj
It had nothing todo with wages Mane wanted to leave and had wanted to for a while,Liverpool,Yes,j72h6t8,t1_j72fr3z
"I don‚Äôt get why people can‚Äôt understand that Man√© wanted to leave, we didn‚Äôt want to sell him but it was his choice to leave. He told the club he wants to leave before the 21/22 season even started",Liverpool,Yes,j72m9su,t1_j72fr3z
"he wanted to go, what did you wanted the club to do? hold him hostage?",Liverpool,Yes,j72n8f8,t1_j72fr3z
"He is but he hasn‚Äôt looked extraordinary in this match, Palhinha has been better",Liverpool,Yes,j73pekd,t1_j73n8oy

"No spending 600+ million in half a season is absolute mental and something should be done about it

Probably right. But I think it's one of those situations where it's so brutally obvious that Fab's form is gone that he figured there's no use in papering over it. A plummet in form this extreme probably hasn't happened in his tenure. I appreciate the candor.,Liverpool,Yes,j72gumg,t1_j71lama
"There should be a post on the sub. Basically he said how Fabinho is not in good form and that it's good we have Bajcetic. Gave us an injury update , jota back in full training next week, VVD and Bobby back soon",Liverpool,Yes,j71m534,t1_j71lwvd

"Does out of form extend to our pressing being poor? Just looks like the players are fucked. Like against Brighton in the league it was genuinely 2 passes and they were into our defence.

"I think it absolutely can be down to a single person, considering he's very close to Klopp. Highly doubt Klopp would let the club just fire him.

"Lack of transfers + fatigue from last years quadruple run. It's not talked about as much as it should. 4 trophy runs right to the end, only to win two domestic cups is excruciating for the players, but the drop off in performance has been noticeable since last season.

">. What ACTUAL evidence is there that he has ‚Äútoo much power‚Äù?

There is a few articles from reliable jouro's saying that him and Klopp have been given more power in terms of transfers, this can be backed up by the fact that months ago one of the big Dutch journo's reported saying that Pep see's Gakpo as the ""missing piece to Liverpool"" and then months later we sign him without there being any known interest before.

Klopp also clearly has certain players in mind for his midfield rebuild like Bellingham, Caicedo and they probably wanted Enzo as well before he went to Chelsea if Bellingham fell through and that is a big reason for us not going for anyone this window.",Liverpool,Yes,j725tzo,t1_j71s64m
"> What ACTUAL evidence is there that he has ‚Äútoo much power‚Äù?

Well, the Melissa Reddy article that just came out for one; and The Athletic article that came out a few months back. It's not just Lijnders of course though, it's the coaching staff as a whole who seem to have gained too much power.",Liverpool,Yes,j71t6vy,t1_j71s64m
True. It just hurts seeing a player of such quality going to a rival. I think it hurts because Reddy came out with that report last year that we will be monitoring him. What could have been‚Ä¶,Liverpool,Yes,j73l7nw,t1_j73kxjb

Basically, you've read one article that mentions his name and demonised him as a result, much in the same way people have demonised Ljinders over the last month or so because he released a book and he too  apparently has too much ""influence"" behind the scenes.

But yeah I think Thiago's ball-winning ability has always been great for us. He can be a bit reckless in the challenge but his reading of the game and physicality means he gets there more often than not, and was better than any other midfielder we had off the ball other than Fabinho when he was good and Henderson at his best, but both are specialist 6s.

Edit: it seems it is from an older Irish folk song",Liverpool,Yes,j6zgwk2,t1_j6zdxhg
"When he first came through the system myself and many rated him highly because of his flair and eye for goal. Then I can‚Äôt help but think he was mismanaged by Klopp in turning him into essentially a Gini 2.0 and also really should‚Äôve allowed him on loan to Leipzig when they came calling. There were games were he was our best player but will drop a stinker the next game and Klopp will bench him for a while, that accompanied with weird injuries has in my opinion slowed his progression",Liverpool,Yes,j6wki7y,t1_j6wi1yw
What happened to him is what I fear for Fabio and Harvey. Playing someone in their wrong position which curbs their development. Go back to Arsenal away in the League Cup. One of his best performances for the club imo. Unfortunately he has been getting injured too often and can‚Äôt build consistency,Liverpool,Yes,j6wlp62,t1_j6wi1yw
"On his day he is capable of great things, those days have just been few and far between due to LOTS of injuries, playing unfamiliar roles and lack of confidence due to the first two points.

You need only go back to the first half of 2021 to see what he is capable of, people act like the only thing he's ever done is score that goal against Everton but he was literally bossing must-win CL ties. That game against Porto he was comfortably the best player on the pitch. 

He has stagnated but he's still just 22 ffs. If the question is whether he should stay then the answer for me is a resounding yes.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wmmjj,t1_j6wi1yw
For me hes the type of player you keep around as long as hes happy being a squad player. He's bever going to be a star or key player but hes a good squad option to rotate and he is homegrown which the club needs. Im happy staying but if he wants to be a key player in his career he'll leave.,Liverpool,Yes,j6zdbs0,t1_j6wi1yw
"You can tell from the first game. Every single person knows it, when someone just has *it*. As a fanbase we‚Äôre too nice and accepting of mediocrity. Jones is not at this level and he never will be and Klopp extending his contract to 2027 is absolutely disgusting. I think if we get Arab owners, they will genuinely get rid of Klopp.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wlqhv,t1_j6wi1yw
"No, he's not good enough. I definitely didn't like seeing that Klopp wants him to be part of the future. Was hoping he'd be sold off soon.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wkd37,t1_j6wi1yw
![gif](giphy|l4KibWpBGWchSqCRy),Liverpool,Yes,j6xl45t,t1_j6xkwhr
Is he still relevant? Haven't heard from him for years.,Liverpool,Yes,j6xzepl,t1_j6xw6gr
Don't think you'll find that many Arsenal fans wanking off Ronaldo like he does.,Liverpool,Yes,j6xyzlb,t1_j6xw6gr
"More important to bring in new players and refresh the squad. Having the same bunch of guys go at it again, they won't be up for the task while new players will be keen on impressing with their new club. You can't expect the same core to pick themselves back up and fight for the title once again, you need to sign younger players who are not only more energetic and hungry for success, but will also help push the old guard and provide a spark.",Liverpool,Yes,j6w1t9t,t1_j6vzdtw
"Putting an insane effort that gets you so close to completing football and suffering a double heartbreak in the same week to the same teams who had already beaten you to the same prizes. That shit doesn't let me sleep, let alone players who were there.",Liverpool,Yes,j6w0jp7,t1_j6vzdtw
"I agree but I think motivation and mentality is just part of the puzzle. 

What I would say the reason is Stagnation. Tactically, physically and mentally.",Liverpool,Yes,j6w41hq,t1_j6vzdtw
This was confirmed by Klopp and some players that the team was mentally exhausted after coming so close last season.,Liverpool,Yes,j6w05z2,t1_j6vzdtw
"thats good, stops owners using loan etc to buy clubs",Liverpool,Yes,j6wgwxd,t1_j6wgf7n
"Given our luck it would be more likely that he injures one of our players and avoids punishment.

In all seriousness I wonder if he's going to be playing for them next season or if they'll try and sell him/pay him off.",Liverpool,Yes,j6y8tfl,t1_j6y8fuw
Doubt he plays for utd again tbh,Liverpool,Yes,j6yrrza,t1_j6y8fuw
"Are we putting all our eggs in 1 basket though? Are we going for Bellingham and no one else? Are we even going for Bellingham? 

Baffles me how people on here talk like they know what the club are gonna do over paper talk and rumours on twitter haha.

The was I see it is at least 3 midfielders are gonna be leaving this summer Milner Keita Ox all being out of contract. This season has also expressed even more that the likes of Fabinho, Hendo and Jones aren't good enough.

IMO we aren't gonna let 3 or more midfielders leave and only bring in 1.",Liverpool,Yes,j6xnjq2,t1_j6x1kaa
Ugarte,Liverpool,Yes,j6xrosv,t1_j6xrkv4
"Ideal summer window for me: Bellingham, Kone, Caicedo, Gvardiol 

Reality: Nunes and Ox/Keita contract extension",Liverpool,Yes,j6xtvjn,t1_j6xrkv4
Gvardiol,Liverpool,Yes,j6y5z7h,t1_j6xrkv4
Takes up a non home grown spot. Would be a no from me tbh. Especially when you think of his injuries.,Liverpool,Yes,j6wnsqo,t1_j6wm088
"I don't mind keeping him but I don't see an issue with letting him go, he has been injured for the majority of the last 2/3 years and really hasn't been that good when he has played in that time and I know people point towards his form this season but I honestly don't think he's been that good.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wmsyl,t1_j6wm088
"The obvious solution is a 4-2-3-1 with Gakpo on the left, Firmino in the 10, Mo on the right and Nunez at striker. But knowing Klopp we‚Äôll probably see Nunez at the 10, Bobby on the right, Mo on the left and Gakpo at striker",Liverpool,Yes,j6xd53h,t1_j6xcnpo
What bombshell did my boy drop?,Liverpool,Yes,j6yw673,t1_j6yth3i
"I just want to see Gakpo on the left, Nunez central for fucks sake",Liverpool,Yes,j6xk9np,t1_j6xgldo
If everyone is fit maybe,Liverpool,Yes,j6xhd2o,t1_j6xgldo
LIVARS should be April 9th,Liverpool,Yes,j6wozkf,t1_j6wi7y9
i don't think FSG care much about trophies,Liverpool,Yes,j6wdfxe,t1_j6wcw55
We've had like two months of free time to figure things out lmao,Liverpool,Yes,j6wbthp,t1_j6w93nu
I think it would be patronising to watch us play the likes of Djurgarden and Dnipro-1,Liverpool,Yes,j6wfaom,t1_j6w98zs
I don't like having games once a week either but it *would* be better for the club to be able to focus on the league alone next season. Especially if there's new owners.,Liverpool,Yes,j6way1y,t1_j6w98zs
"Also, I really want to go to some mental places again. One of the only fun times I had under Roy Hodgson was playing that team in North Macedonia and seeing N'gog score a brace. It was also basically pre-season and I remember Kyrgiakos had to have a police escort into and out of the stadium haha.",Liverpool,Yes,j70r2ow,t1_j6w98zs
"Completely agree. With all the talks of a supposed rebuild, a lesser European competition would actually be pretty useful to bed players in.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wbxm6,t1_j6w98zs
FSG is dismantling and breaking the said ladder into pieces as we speak,Liverpool,Yes,j6wasun,t1_j6w98zs
"Ngl I'd love to see us in the ECL if we can't get CL this season, it'd be a good opportunity for the youth team and we'd probably win it and complete our trophy cabinet",Liverpool,Yes,j6wjsv6,t1_j6w98zs
Game in hand is against Chelsea away and they will be super motivated seeing how they get backed. I'd be shocked if we get anything there,Liverpool,Yes,j6wmc04,t1_j6we7cx
"I just checked 20/21 and it seems we didn't actually kick into gear until mid-March so it's definitely not over

But on the flip side, I don't expect us to get any better at all until firstly Jota is back (hopefully in the next two weeks), and then Diaz (also mid-March?). And that's not factoring in Konate and VvD",Liverpool,Yes,j6wehrq,t1_j6we7cx
Us winning seems impossible right now. Not saying we can't but I think we play too high up the pitch for the current squad. We need to sit much deeper and play tighter. Hit them on the counter with Darwin and Salah,Liverpool,Yes,j6x9ifu,t1_j6we7cx
That's called mid-table-syndrom,Liverpool,Yes,j6w8wt5,t1_j6w7qbz
Panic or be optimistic‚Ä¶.,Liverpool,Yes,j6w8lau,t1_j6w7qbz
"Suck it up mate.
All you can do",Liverpool,Yes,j6w9ecr,t1_j6w7qbz
"Ben is a spoofer. If it ain‚Äôt Lynch, Maddock, Miller, Ornstein or Joyce, I ain‚Äôt hearing it. Can‚Äôt include Pearce because he is basically an FSG reporter and is lacking independent thinking imo",Liverpool,Yes,j6w8gdr,t1_j6w5m2v
"Jacobs said there was no Qatar interest in Liverpool for ages, he doesn't know anything about Liverpool",Liverpool,Yes,j6w96s3,t1_j6w5m2v
They already ruled themselves out and one of them owns shares in Palace as well.,Liverpool,Yes,j6w6piz,t1_j6w5m2v
Because he's poor apparently,Liverpool,Yes,j6w5ziy,t1_j6w5m2v
"A double W.

Enjoy! Great atmosphere in the ground last season, I've never vented so much animosity at a player, as I did at Richarlison, followed closely by Pickford, who began wasting time in the first minute.

I think we'll stuff them. Not because we're good, but because they're so shit.",Liverpool,Yes,j6we78x,t1_j6wdiw5
"Some of my absolute best times at the match have been against Everton, you'll have a great time.

If we get anything like Origi 90+6, Virgil's debut goal or the Curtis Jones winner, it'll be a great night",Liverpool,Yes,j6wifsr,t1_j6wdiw5
we barely attack on the ground anymore lol,Liverpool,Yes,j6wfgok,t1_j6wep8h
"Was thinking about this the other day, its been 100 years.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wf05b,t1_j6wep8h
"We scored one vs Rangers, before that we got one vs City I‚Äôm the community shield",Liverpool,Yes,j6wfz2a,t1_j6wep8h
Last prem one was Fabinho against Watford I think,Liverpool,Yes,j6wny6h,t1_j6wep8h
">If Klopp managed city they‚Äôd still have Fernandinho aguero david silva etc as long as possible

I mean those players still left City at 36, 32, and 35 respectively.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wph8i,t1_j6wnt4t
"Pep kept a lot of them on as well.

If Bobby's happy to be a 6th choice attacker, on a reduced wage, why wouldn't you keep him? He's still got a lot to contribute. We've got 4 attackers under the age of 26 and two over the age of 30. It's not like it's an aging part of the team.",Liverpool,Yes,j70ptlx,t1_j6wnt4t
"Klopp is too loyal to certain players I know he said he isn't but he clearly is, keeping Firmino is really just a sentimental thing because if you base giving him a contract on the last few years then there's no way he should be getting one.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wo2tv,t1_j6wnt4t
Tbf bobby was having a good start before injuries,Liverpool,Yes,j6wv6qd,t1_j6wnt4t
"Fernandinho was 35-36 yo when he left ManCity.  
Bobby is 31 yo, with loads of wisdom.   
I don't mind that at all.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wq9my,t1_j6wnt4t
"Exactly we‚Äôd just be making the same mistakes if we gave him a new contract. Keeping old, injury prone players who are past their best won‚Äôt do anything for our rebuild",Liverpool,Yes,j6wpg02,t1_j6wnt4t
"Age is irrelevant . You‚Äôre good enough or you are not.

Exhibit A : Modric

Exhibit B : Fabinho




One should be washed up, one should be in his prime",Liverpool,Yes,j6wr4m8,t1_j6wnt4t
"It's not Klopps fault that he can't get the funds to sign new players and we have to just stick with what we've got. But Bobby was our best player the start of this season so im glad he's renewing his contract tbh, definitely still a place for him in our squad imo",Liverpool,Yes,j6wpt6p,t1_j6wnt4t
Is there?,Liverpool,Yes,j6wtbop,t1_j6wl3x6
?,Liverpool,Yes,j6wozqs,t1_j6wl3x6
"Fuck FSG. This is what they‚Äôre doing to people, turning people insane",Liverpool,Yes,j6wzm2i,t1_j6wz86o
BRB changing the Wikipedia entry for Liverpool FC to ‚ÄúLiverpool FC: Charity - gives points to under served and under represented premier league teams‚Äù,Liverpool,Yes,j6x7oo6,t1_j6wz86o
Sporting director at Dinamo Moscow,Liverpool,Yes,j6wxhk0,t1_j6wvlez
"I'm actually dreading the Everton one. Yes, it's at home and they're utter shite, but they have Brexitball Dyche at the wheel, and he'll set up a nasty 4-4-2 bus that will be utterly difficult to break down. I'm predicting a 0-0, maybe 1-1 draw given how scrappy they'll play.",Liverpool,Yes,j6y7qyc,t1_j6y2ron
"Wolves under Lopetegui look a lot better, Everton will have Dyche so a new manager bounce and away to Newcastle is going to be a guranteed L if we're being honest.",Liverpool,Yes,j6y3y9t,t1_j6y2ron
I have a bad feeling about the Everton game. Dyche will probably have them fired up and the game might go scrappy since both teams are shit. Praying for no injuries from that fixture.,Liverpool,Yes,j6y4ukz,t1_j6y2ron
We could also go 0/12 and therein lies the problem. We‚Äôre so inconsistent with our performances that fixtures in the past that felt like sure things are not anymore,Liverpool,Yes,j6yfek9,t1_j6y2ron
"Anyone can beat us at the moment , we are out of sync , way off the mark and too many players having bad preforormances all too regularly.  I'd be surprised if we pick up more than 6 pionts and Madrid could embarrass  us",Liverpool,Yes,j6yqr1g,t1_j6y2ron
*At least the memes are good...*,Liverpool,Yes,j6wej68,t1_j6wbupj
Pain,Liverpool,Yes,j6wd258,t1_j6wbupj
"Can't see him ever leaving. Maybe when he's about to retire, or he get's pushed out by someone and get's a transfer to idk RM,Barca, Bayern or some other huge club, but doubt he would push for that himself. He is from Liverpool, his family probably lives in the city, he's already on his best way to become a liverpool legend, why would he throw it away?",Liverpool,Yes,j6z9c26,t1_j6z6zyl
"Simply because they struck a deal where he pays her shit loads of money for her silence

Their reunion is an act",Liverpool,Yes,j6xwxre,t1_j6xmud6
"OP - I'm inclined to agree, after hearing the audio I don't see how it could be anything other than what you've described. I assume they w been apart for a while, which makes me surprised his hold was so strong, but hey, the dynamics of these relationships are pretty damn unusual. Such an absolute mess.",Liverpool,Yes,j6y57ep,t1_j6xmud6
"This season Firmino has been good but he was below average for 2 seasons at least. What if he goes back to that form? I think the chances are high given how long his bad form lasted compared to the half a season where he has been good. Plus we need money to sign players. We also need to get younger players and plan for the future - it doesn‚Äôt matter if attack already has players for the future, we need slots for other areas like midfield. Considering all these factors I think we need to move on. We are making the same mistake we made giving Henderson a new contract. We have less money and less slots to get a new player primed for success at the right age.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wio2t,t1_j6wfmyn
We have a Firmino?,Liverpool,Yes,j6whgqt,t1_j6wfmyn
"Definitely keep him if his wages and non-HG spot aren't costing us bringing in a ready-made, starting XI calibre talent

And as it stands, we've got bigger problems in that regard than Bobby",Liverpool,Yes,j6wgic9,t1_j6wfmyn
"He is incredible as a 2nd half sub, why would anybody want him out?",Liverpool,Yes,j6wg1v5,t1_j6wfmyn
Most of the comments are comparing him to keeping around our midfielders so long but the situation is completely different,Liverpool,Yes,j6wgt9z,t1_j6wfmyn
"When fit, which isn‚Äôt often of late, he won‚Äôt be starting, he takes up a squad space, he‚Äôll still be on decent money, considering his age etc yes it‚Äôs wiser to let him go. Keep him for what? To be a cheer leader? The I play a few games a season we can give minutes to some younger players. We don‚Äôt have many games left this season, won‚Äôt have too many next season with no europe, so there isn‚Äôt a valid reason to keep him",Liverpool,Yes,j6wz7hq,t1_j6wfmyn
We were genuinely good in 20/21. We had the best form in the League for the majority of the season. That middle part + VAR bullshit is what did us in. We could've shithoused a title with a bit more luck.,Liverpool,Yes,j6wetsj,t1_j6w6snc
"20/21 squad easily, not even a contest. Forget how the names look on paper, we actually controlled most of our games still. That was the season where teams low blocked the hell out of us and we found it difficult to break them down and keep clean sheets. This current team doesn‚Äôt look like it can dominate a game or out play any opponent to me, the attack and midfield is considerably worse.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wdvkn,t1_j6w6snc
"On paper this one all day, but in reality it feels like something is different this year, like the fight has genuinely gone from some of them.",Liverpool,Yes,j6w77vb,t1_j6w6snc
That one because competition was worse in 20/21 imo and they still had some gas in the tank.,Liverpool,Yes,j6wbi63,t1_j6w6snc
Ugarte nunes(or mount) Jude please,Liverpool,Yes,j6wf8v8,t1_j6wf3vm
"Spurs didn‚Äôt expand one of their stands or did they? 


Checkmate FSG hater",Liverpool,Yes,j6w9sfu,t1_j6w8qoz
Shame how many of you don‚Äôt care for the club u less we‚Äôre winning really,Liverpool,Yes,j6we941,t1_j6w8qoz
"Same owners - very high 
New owners -not likely
He‚Äôs not 25 where he has time. 
He has elite mentality of winners not trust the process transitions from 1st/2nd to 11th",Liverpool,Yes,j6wfk8p,t1_j6wfez9
"Slim to none. He's an excellent player and I believe he could evolve into a playmaker coming off our right wing, if he was to lose pace, with TAA overlapping and supported by a BWM/BBM. Could possibly be phased out for Elliott after a few years.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wfs35,t1_j6wfez9
He won't leave. PSG are gonna go back to Ziyech who plays in the same position after missing out on him and we won't sell him to a PL rival. Reastically no one can afford him right now.,Liverpool,Yes,j6wg53d,t1_j6wfez9
"I don‚Äôt see him leaving and I don‚Äôt want to see him leaving.

He‚Äôs still putting up good numbers even in a dysfunctional team and I feel his form has been overblown slightly. 

Has he been good? No. Has he been provided much to work with? Also no. 

We saw what he can do when provided service before the world cup",Liverpool,Yes,j6wfqgt,t1_j6wfez9
"virtually zero, no one's going to stump up enough cash for him. Maybe cash plus a player but you don't see that happening much.

Wouldn't like to see him go though.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wik6b,t1_j6wfez9
For. He‚Äôs not gonna be the great player he‚Äôs was before. I love him but we should have spent all that money on Mane,Liverpool,Yes,j6wmd7y,t1_j6wfez9
"If he goes he goes, if he stays he stays. I can see pros and cons in both. Either way we need to plan for the day he‚Äôs not around we can‚Äôt keep players Indefinitely",Liverpool,Yes,j6wzhsh,t1_j6wfez9
"Would depend on the amount offered and whether Salah wants to leave or not.  If it‚Äôs a reasonable fee and he wants out, then so be it.",Liverpool,Yes,j6x8ses,t1_j6wfez9
Do you mind sharing those ITKs?,Liverpool,Yes,j6xsvf8,t1_j6x7zcv
New bargain bucket is coming out so thats probably it,Liverpool,Yes,j6y7pld,t1_j6y70ep
"Breaking the news of the new KFC value bucket, presumably.",Liverpool,Yes,j6y7d1d,t1_j6y70ep
Considering his last break about the club was that a bid from Qatar had come in as early as January 13th... yeah don't hold your breath.,Liverpool,Yes,j6y87ky,t1_j6y70ep
It‚Äôll be some bs that‚Äôs already been floating around all day most likely the stuff about the take over that was going around last night,Liverpool,Yes,j6y86ik,t1_j6y70ep
His shift at KFC probably ends at 9pm,Liverpool,Yes,j6yeyjg,t1_j6y70ep
"If approved is our best itk, indy is the worst.",Liverpool,Yes,j6yc56f,t1_j6y70ep
"I wouldn't renew him either. But if we decided to keep him as a 6th choice attacker I wouldn't be overly bothered either. 

I will say though, people on here think he was in some unreal form before the WC but lets be honest 50% of his PL contributions came from 1 game. And his only contributions in the CL came in a hammering against a poor Rangers team. He had 1 goal in his last 9 games before his injury. 

The wrong side of 30, Becoming more injury prone and has declined massively over the last couple of years. Could still do a job but when players get unreliable we should cut ties. It's what's hindered us the last few years.",Liverpool,Yes,j6xk7oe,t1_j6x1l90
Our other attacking players aren‚Äôt fairing very well either. If Bobby can step back into a distributor role it‚Äôs a good move. His passing is as good as Thiago‚Äôs when he‚Äôs on form.,Liverpool,Yes,j6x7bb0,t1_j6x1l90
Depends on mods mood,Liverpool,Yes,j6w0qkg,t1_j6vx3xp
Depends on who posts them.,Liverpool,Yes,j6w4ppl,t1_j6vx3xp
">as long as we play semi-decently 

Well I‚Äôve found the problem in your theory",Liverpool,Yes,j6vyntb,t1_j6vxysb
"Wolves and especially Everton are must wins and really no excuse not to take all 6 points. I don't think anyone should be too surprised if we fail to beat the most defensively sound team this year in Newcastle given how there is no supply to the product in our final third.

In saying that we got a late winner against Newcastle earlier in the season, but at this point all I'm asking for is a convincing display against a side who we should be beating easily on paper. Our players need some confidence and belief again",Liverpool,Yes,j6vyn6r,t1_j6vxysb
That would be a cracking signing even if for a few months,Liverpool,Yes,j6w8kmc,t1_j6w8frc
We‚Äôre not cut throat enough to offload players like Fabinho,Liverpool,Yes,j6wzog0,t1_j6wzgzc
"I think we get:

Zieler (cheap)

Bellingham 

Matheus Nunes

Mason Mount (free)

Jo≈°ko Gvardiol

With 3 of these being sizable outlays.

Curtis Jones becomes a homegrown player next year I think? Ramsay/Carvalho/Elliott/Bellingham/Doak/Davies/Gordon/Bacjetic all still u-21 so don't need to be registered in 2023/24 PL squad

I agree that we would look to shift Fabinho though I suspect Klopp might take the same view as when we held on to Sturridge and Lovren - that yes we could get ¬£20-30m for him but he's probably better than the equivalent player we could buy on the open market for the same money

I'd hope we can sell him and get in another body for the strictly DM position.

Firmino I hope signs a new contract and stays. Milner I think this will finally be a season too far and should leave.

Adri√°n/Oxlade-Chamberlain/Ke√Øta/Phillips also to leave

Carvalho is an interesting one, I reckon he'd do well on loan to get experience. I'm not sure where he fits in, especially if we signed Mount.",Liverpool,Yes,j6x2t6r,t1_j6wzgzc
"I like everything you've said. Only thing I don't agree on is Milner. The only good thing he has going for him is his professionalism, Experience and being a leader. We have loads of players like that though. 

He's versatile but realistically isn't really good enough in any position now. I don't think we need to keep him and Henderson. And realistically we aren't gonna shift Hendo on.",Liverpool,Yes,j6x1js5,t1_j6wzgzc
"Bellingham
Ugarte
Nunes/caicedo
Keep fabinho and sell matip he wants to return to Germany aswell.

A homegrown gk would be fantastic.",Liverpool,Yes,j6xrz17,t1_j6wzgzc
"I think Milner staying is good for a year, Hendo can go, and I think being captain, if he left it would really help change this foolish loyalty culture. We'd need a new captain, let alone a replacement. Milner seems to execute as he's required to, more so than Hendo.

I'd prefer Kelleher to stay, but accept it's asking a bit much. All the others can go, along with Gomez. I think bellingham and Florian Wirtz or Sucic.

We'd need more, but I'm not sure who else, and who would be a reasonable price. Hopefully we could build with the above, plus Morton back in the fold.",Liverpool,Yes,j6x3zx2,t1_j6wzgzc
No chance we get Chiesa as a BACKUP for Salah! He‚Äôd be his replacement if anything.,Liverpool,Yes,j6wxmz4,t1_j6wvfft
I‚Äôd love him. But we‚Äôd need to let firmino and one other forward go. Can‚Äôt see it happening I‚Äôm afraid.,Liverpool,Yes,j6ww4f6,t1_j6wvfft
"I‚Äôd rather just get the midfield sorted we do need a long term Salah replacement but attack is the least of our issues at the moment

We need to prioritise midfield and defence he‚Äôd still likely cost around 50m so just not worth it",Liverpool,Yes,j6wxsfe,t1_j6wvfft
We signed the immovable midfielder Copium,Liverpool,Yes,j6xwnqe,t1_j6x6ltv
"Doubt we‚Äôll get 4 at bernabeu, but good to see some optimism",Liverpool,Yes,j6wbcsf,t1_j6wb4xr
"2-0 at Anfield, 2-2 at the Bernabeu. The reds knock Madrid out.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wbatf,t1_j6wb4xr
We are currently shit so we will definitely shithouse through Madrid and lose to Wolves or something either side of it,Liverpool,Yes,j6wcvsu,t1_j6wb4xr
"Nothing in between, either what you said or we hammer them 3-0.... then lose 4-1 to Palace 3 days later.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wiz8p,t1_j6wb4xr
We‚Äôll go through 2.1,Liverpool,Yes,j6x0460,t1_j6wb4xr
Can't we just play like how we played against City at Anfield? Bring back the 4-4-2!,Liverpool,Yes,j6wdf4x,t1_j6wb4xr
"4-2, narrow first leg and we capitulate in the 2nd leg",Liverpool,Yes,j6wf2lb,t1_j6wb4xr
"it's actually nothing like the Ox/Keita situation. Both were signed and given big contracts as first team, starting 11 type players. Due to their injuries they never quite hit the heights they should have, and as such, were impossible to sell, and so difficult to replace in the squad until their contracts ran down. Their presence impacted Liverpool's ability to bring in other first team midfielders. Re-signing James Milner, for instance, does none of these things, as his wages and squad position mean the club can still go out and bring in the midfielders they want, in theory, once Ox and Keita go.

Firmino has already been effectively replaced. He is an experienced, quality player who will be accepting a reduction in wages to remain as a bit part of a front 6 - so if he gets injured, or loses form, it doesn't affect the team's wider ability to perform, or affect the club's potential depth in the front line for the next few years.

Jorginho, same age, a DM with less mobilty and less commitment to Arsenal, was just signed for ¬£12m and was deemed a sensible transfer. Holding onto Bobby gives Liverpool options for how to play, while keeping one of the most committed and positive presences around the squad. And it ultimately won't affect their ability to sign new forwards - as is evidenced by the fact that Liverpool just signed another forward that they look to be attempting to mould into a similar position.",Liverpool,Yes,j6w65on,t1_j6vwgz7
Agreed. Won't get much love for it tho.,Liverpool,Yes,j6w3q71,t1_j6vwgz7

Cos Mane has pulled up trees at Bayern. All our players are suffering from last season and getting injuries. Mane had an injury as well. Salah is in a team that barely gets the ball forward quickly anymore. Also he‚Äôs off form and confidence is low throughout the team. Class is permanent as they say.,Liverpool,Yes,j6w6be6,t1_j6w5zty
"Mane hasn't been the better player since 2020, he had a awful 20/21 season and then he was average for most of 21/22 until the last few months where he went on a scoring run

Getting rid of Mane was the right decision, we miss the 2020 Mane not the current one who is half the player. Our attack is only a problem because we have Diaz and Jota out, and Nunez the big money signing hasn't had a instant impact.",Liverpool,Yes,j6w6gjr,t1_j6w5zty

Salah has not

Salah > Man√©",Liverpool,Yes,j6w6qvg,t1_j6w5zty
"For the 900th time MANE ASKED TO LEAVE, we didn‚Äôt just flog him off.

The choice to keep him against his will after everything he‚Äôs done for this club would have been fucking shitty.

"How many times are we gonna bring up this argument ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Mane left because he wanted a change, he had informed Klopp in summer of 2021 that he wanted to leave after 21/22 season. Salah wanted to stay and Mane wanted to leave, that‚Äôs why Salah was offered a new contract. It‚Äôs really simple to understand.",Liverpool,Yes,j6w6gdg,t1_j6w5zty
Lol really nailed it with the ‚Äúunpopular opinion‚Äù haha,Liverpool,Yes,j6wcndt,t1_j6w5zty
"Even more unpopular opinion, I'd have sold both. And Bobby too. Think the legendary front three had run its course and we needed a clean break.",Liverpool,Yes,j6w7dml,t1_j6w5zty

"I know it's Indy, meaning it's likely to be complete bollocks, but it would be funny to get behind the scenes and watch the arguments between John Henry and Tom Werner over selling the club.

"As a Sevilla fan, he shouldn't even be considered here. He was decent with us, but he didn't see eye to eye with our Sporting Director, Monchi, and he doesn't really offer much at his Current Level. He's headed to the Middle East imo.",Liverpool,Yes,j6z26gf,t1_j6z0y8o

">Granted, it‚Äôs very hard to reach a conviction without the victim testifying.

"and yet for years people have insisted how superior they were to the Glazers who were just using the club for money. without Klopp and Barcelona being reckless with their spending a few years back, we'd be a top 4 side at best and FSG would have been satisfied with that",Liverpool,Yes,j6w58b2,t1_j6w4rw4
"Why on Earth would you buy a business if not to profit? I get that people see football as different, but it's not. If I buy a distressed business and put in the time and effort to make it better and generate money, of course that money is mine when I sell!",Liverpool,Yes,j70pckh,t1_j6w4rw4
"Exactly this. They may not take dividends, but that doesn't make them much better than other American owners; what they do is choke off cashflow available to the manager for on-field success in favour of paying down debt used for hard/infrastructure assets, which directly increases projected revenue and asset valuation. Is that also good for the club - yes, of course, a new stand is important, as are new facilities etc. But there's a point at which single-minded fixed asset investment is counterproductive - there's no point in having 100,000 seats if the football is dire and the squad is knackered and you're sat in 10th. It's a balancing act and they've gotten it badly wrong, like an obese man doing a man on a wire thing. The last straw really has been this winter window, where they're not even allowing the manager to spend club cash flow + a tiny amount for net spend in the middle of a bonafide midfield crisis - because they only look at player purchases as an overvalued/undervalued asset with resale value (which is why they'd approve a Gakpo purchase but not a Caicedo).",Liverpool,Yes,j6w4725,t1_j6w1x8c
"So sad that so many people don‚Äôt see it. We should be out there protesting and flags in Anfield every week, but so many people are happy to let it go.

I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs taken so long for so many people to realise. The sooner they‚Äôre gone the better,Liverpool,Yes,j6w1t07,t1_j6w19rb
It was mentioned in Lynch's article that after the Gakpo deal we prioritised debt repayment. I don't think it was mentioned where he got that information from though.,Liverpool,Yes,j6wb4sb,t1_j6w9b2r

"We lost 530m in Covid? The season after we won the UCL? The season we won the league? Yet no other club seems to have suffered as badly? It‚Äôs a joke that you swallow these lines they feed you, telling you that they just don‚Äôt have any money",Liverpool,Yes,j70tlko,t1_j70p71p

"tbh im the same in that im finding myself not wanting to watch our games, and its precisely *because* I care about the club lol

If I didn't care about the club or only in a minor way, I'd have no problem watching our midfield get outrun and outgunned by everyone and conceding within the first 10 mins like clockwork

I didn't get a chance to go see us at Anfield this season, and I've seen us live once in August; my not watching will have no tangible effect on the team, and will save me a tonne of anxiety and stress",Liverpool,Yes,j6wf22n,t1_j6we941
It does seem to have become more accepted now to stop watching when we‚Äôre shit which is mad to me because that just seems like textbook fair weather support. Like the definition of plastic. Fair enough if there‚Äôs something else on at the same time as games but otherwise‚Ä¶,Liverpool,Yes,j6y29vn,t1_j6we941

">but we should have spent all that money on Mane

Mane can barely keep himself fit nowadays, and Salah has still been better for the past 3 years at least than Mane.

"just follow @lfcapproved. Im still skeptical about others people consider not total bs (Tristan for example) but approved knows stuff Im almost certain and isnt just looking for attention/engagement. He barely tweeted on deadline day either when the fanbase wouldve eaten everything up.

"Mount's contract isn't up till the following summer

Gvardiol looks like he's signing a new contract, I do think we will be in for him the following summer though with Matip likely to leave on a free.

Jones could be moved into the homegrown section if needed yeah but I think we'd still need one more possibbly.",Liverpool,Yes,j6x38yl,t1_j6x2t6r
"The issue we have is Kelleher, Phillips and Ox are all homegrown so letting go of Milner would be 4 homegrown players gone in one go which is too much. Bringing in Zieler makes up for Kelleher but we still need another two after that.",Liverpool,Yes,j6x2f7y,t1_j6x1js5
"I'd also rather Milner stay over Hendo but don't think that'll happen.

I think the club would rather keep Kelleher as well but from what I've seen it's him that wants to leave to get more game time.",Liverpool,Yes,j6xat0h,t1_j6x3zx2
why cant we rotate them?,Liverpool,Yes,j6wzqsb,t1_j6wxmz4
"Idk we do really need a backup/long term replacement for Salah, unless they see Doak as that then I don't know why we wouldn't go and try get one if the price isn't too much.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wwwg7,t1_j6ww4f6

"Real and Ancelotti are adaptive above all. They knew they'd lose in the CL Final if they went toe-to-toe and got in our faces, so they played like an expensive Burnley and won (with some flukey heroics from Courtois). 

Pep has City play *his* way *always*. They had multiple warnings before Salah scored the winner that day but didn't change a thing. If its Real doing the same, they'll back off and close off the opportunity to counter - they still have a 2nd leg at home if they need it",Liverpool,Yes,j6wepfi,t1_j6wdf4x
"Mane has 10 goals for top of the league Bayern in 22 games, Nunez has 9 goals in 22 goals for us, and we're miles off the level of Bayern this season. People seem to forget how fucking terrible Mane was when out of form.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wbn2t,t1_j6w6be6
People who judge Liverpool players on our 20/21 season need to rethink life,Liverpool,Yes,j6wehyi,t1_j6w6gjr
Injured Mane putting up better numbers than a fit Mo tho. Obviously a lot of nuance between the caliber of the leagues.,Liverpool,Yes,j6wd5jk,t1_j6w6qvg
Still don‚Äôt understand who‚Äôs idea it was to keep ox/Keita and let go of Gini. Even 3/10 Gini performance would massively improve our current midfield,Liverpool,Yes,j6weab4,t1_j6w9eha
Yeah but the thought is that he asked to leave BECAUSE of the long drawn out Mo Salah contract show. Everyone talking about how important Mo is and Mane feeling like he‚Äôs not getting equal recognition. You‚Äôve also gotta imagine now that Mo is earning double anyone else in the team thats gotta leave a bad taste in everyone elses mouth. Especially when he‚Äôs been as shit as anyone this season.,Liverpool,Yes,j6wcyu4,t1_j6w9eha
People seem to forget how much rumbling was occurring before the UCL final due to Mane. Or how it came out after his move he actually wanted to leave in 2021. May I forget that he himself said he thinks Senegalese people want him to move away from LFC,Liverpool,Yes,j6w8lo1,t1_j6w6gdg
"They were 2nd highest scorers, pretty sure we essentially scored our way out of trouble seeing we had the same midfield issues last season. We were 17 points behind city don‚Äôt forget, we‚Äôre only 16 points behind now, but no chance this current attack drags us back to within a point",Liverpool,Yes,j6wefqo,t1_j6w7dml

"He's a much better player than Jones, but that isn't hard tbh. Jones doesn't have a single decent attribute.

"They're selling, what else do you want them to do?",Liverpool,Yes,j70p8vj,t1_j6w2fhs

"Correct; Klopp's method really needs rhythm to work, and that rhythm only really comes from playing every 3/4 days.

"Very good point. Midfield should be the priority. Ndicka on a free would be a fantastic move, but idk how much competition there will be and how big his wages will be.

He was getting goals in the first half of the season sure but his general performances really weren't that good and he was never seen as a goalscorer so I think its more just a small purple goalscoring patch than anything,Liverpool,Yes,j6wrpch,t1_j6wradj

Idk football just doesn‚Äôt make me anxious. It‚Äôs a entertainment at the end of the day and it‚Äôs not impacting any of our lives. However it‚Äôs not supporting a club if you only rock up if we‚Äôre winning. The owners being cunts have no bearing on anyone‚Äôs supporting of the club and the people continually saying they‚Äôll be back when we‚Äôre winning again won‚Äôt be missed.

"Yeh I get that I just think offering a near 38 year old a new contract on around 100k a week just because he's home grown is the exact kind of reason we are in this mess with our midfield as it is haha. 

Like I said if we didn't have Hendo who also is no way near good enough I wouldn't mind but I just think It's time we get a bit more ruthless and less sentimental. 

I'd rather just go for another homegrown player. But I get it might be more difficult doing that. Just shows how much it's messed us up hanging onto all these players for so long.",Liverpool,Yes,j6x780a,t1_j6x2f7y

"Taking a pay out instead of getting justice is basically saying rape is ok for the right price.

"This isn't about their conduct now - it's about their lack of spending since 2019, when they categorically were not selling. And no, if you were an owner who cared about the club and also just a good businessman who wanted to give the CL places a good go, the payoff from buying a midfielder or two, either in the summer or winter, to secure CL revenue would make it a worthwhile investment. At this point their miserliness is actually bad business as well, because it'll affect valuation. The house analogy doesn't hold up when there's a binary CL/no CL event hinging on spending a bit.",Liverpool,Yes,j70r1xf,t1_j70pgkj

">What does he bring right now? He‚Äôs living of a couple goals.

">It‚Äôs a entertainment at the end of the day

That's the thing - it isn't entertaining. I wouldn't care about us being shit but playing with heart and energy, its probably what 90% of football fans in England go through anyway seeing as most don't support top 6 PL clubs, but every single club's fans would be (rightly) fuming, and crucially *not* entertained by players putting in barely any effort.

I've seen my local team live as much as I've seen Liverpool, and they've only been in the top flight 8 seasons since I was born - it's fine, because they put in a shift. 

Can you honestly say many games this season have actually been entertaining from a partisan LFC POV lol. Fewer than 10 at the halfway point of the season most likely

Shankly's line is about support. I'll never not support Liverpool, and any game I see them live I'll be as loud as humanly possible. But for games when its just on TV and I'm at home? Doesn't really factor into Shankly's line",Liverpool,Yes,j6wnqvh,t1_j6wigll

"He must have read a random link somewhere that morning and latched onto it with a gif that no-one would have tied to Arthur Melo so if it didn‚Äôt happen, people would be none the wiser. It follows his pattern of only speaking about something after someone else reports it first.

"An abuse victim is not just as bad as her abuser because she opted not to go to a highly public trial, testify against him, have her whole personal history exploited by high-powered defense attorneys, have it all splashed all over the media, subject herself to vicious attacks online, and possibly decided to accept money for her apparently working class family.

This girl would have gone through absolute fucking hell in testifying.

To say nothing of the psychological elements of abusive relationships, considering the rumors that they're back together, and the fact that her FATHER was supporting Greenwood and pressuring her to shut up about it. This isn't on her.

Deciding not to press charges is the fault of everyone *except* this girl. Greenwood, the court system, the media, her family. But not her.",Liverpool,Yes,j6yhat7,t1_j6yfra3

"We could just keep him for another season.I seriously doubt that he holds enough value that selling him would be worth it. He will be 32 in august and is injury prone. Clubs interested in him would probably just rather take him in a year for free?

He also knows the team/tactics, has experience, was usually always quite good. Hard to judge all our players on this absolute crap season. 

Would rather just sign a new CB for the future and have him still on board. Helps to bed in the new guys and we still have additional cover. I would rather sell Joe Gomez if we get a good offer. I feel like he regressed heavily and is pretty average and isn't a guy you can count on staying fit either. 

Ownership needs to be sorted out before all of that anyway. Doubt they even think too much about summer transfers right now. Our club is insanely dysfunctional right now lol. Too much uncertainty. If FSG is still here in the summer and we miss CL, we will do fuck all lol. 

My dream would be 2-3 midfielders and a CB, maybe we can develop Doak into the RW cover Salah needs as well.",Liverpool,Yes,j6ysx23,t1_j6ykw31
">They did that under Fat Frank last time too. I'm not sure if they'll be harder to beat I think their team is just crap atm.

"There‚Äôs a big difference between being annoyed at performances and it ruining your life though. That doesn‚Äôt sound like an interest/hobby, it sounds like a chore. 

That‚Äôs exactly what the line means though, your support shouldn‚Äôt waver because we‚Äôre having a bad year, and as I said, the owners aren‚Äôt the club. It‚Äôs not about the difference you‚Äôre personally making, if that was the case then none of us matter at all.",Liverpool,Yes,j6wonic,t1_j6wnqvh
I think both come as a package. Each one frightened the other will supersede them. Mo is too relaxed at the moment. I‚Äôve never seen a player smilie  every time when he misses !!

"The thing that I find most perplexing is I just don't get from a business perspective letting the first team erode.  By strengthening the squad, there are both short and long term benefits.

You get a 20ish games for the player to bed in and integrate into the squad.  It's one less player to buy during the summer.  If somehow everything goes well, you can make a push to get back into the CL, which is a MAJOR financial incentive worth somewhere between 50-100m.

The market isn't going to get more sane.  100m+ for Enzo was seen as a ridiculous price and in the end, Chelsea paid it.  50m for Caicedo this summer was deemed way too much for a player with such limited first team experience yet 6 months later, 60-80m was deemed a price 2 clubs were willing to pay.  The market is crazy and somehow, we think we're going to land the best young player in the world for a ""reasonable"" fee.

I'm just confused how the club haven't evaluated the situation and said ""Let's be honest, we can't put all our eggs in the Bellingham basket.  Let's sit down and figure out something else.  If somehow we do sign him and we've already signed a few other players, it's not like we couldn't sell a player or two to balance the budget / squad balance.

"So what can we expect in the next window? 

We clearly need at least two, but more realistically three midfielders given the expected outgoings in the midfield (Keita, Ox, maybe Milner but at this point I wouldn't mind him staying as a deep rotation option) as well as the loss of form from former mainstays (Fabinho, Henderson). I'm actually still optimistic Bellingham will come *if* he wants to, and I don't think one poor season will disuade him, but the thing that worries me is Bellingham alone won't cut it and won't help us out of this tough situation in the midfield. We need at the very least one more, but preferably two more.

But add to that defense is also looking like an area of the squad we'll need to spend in as well, namely center-back. Matip doesn't look like he is at the level he was a couple of seasons ago and Gomez only provides versatility positionally but he isn't good at this point. Besides, Gomez might be one of the few players who we could sell on for a decent fee (Kelleher and maybe Curtis the only other two). We'll need to also invest in the defense at this point, and that'll be costly as well. Someone like Gvadirol would be a dream, but forgive me for being too skeptical we'll spend on Gvadirol on top of Jude or whoever Jude's back-up is (which clearly isn't Enzo now despite it being the easier deal to be done compared to other back-up targets).

So work definitely needs to be done for sure. Midfield is the clear hole and clear issue that needs to be resolved in the summer, but with defense looking like an area that can't be ignored as well, it does leave me with a bit of worry on whether or not we can spend enough to be able to replenish the squad and add new pieces.",Liverpool,No,j6r16gl,t3_10qm41m

I'm starting to believe that the reason why we didn't buy anyone after the CL win was because Klopp didn't want anyone. If he was happy with the team this summer then he must have been ecstatic with the team after the CL win and didn't see a need for new players.,Liverpool,No,j6rqbgs,t3_10qm41m
 The enzo deal hurts. Very smart from Chelsea. Chelsea signing him feels like how city signed KDB because it‚Äôs so obvious how good the player is. He can play the ball beautifully and is so physical. He loves himself ground duels but is so technical. Better than Jude at this moment in time (I know I might get downvoted for that). Take me back to December when we were dreaming about him.,Liverpool,No,j6qu8n9,t3_10qm41m
The club flexing about being environmentally sustainable when we just had an embarrassing  transfer window amongst terrible form is as infuriating as it gets,Liverpool,No,j6sdxyl,t3_10qm41m
"Curious, when we went for Ox and Keita were they part of the ‚ÄúLiverpool only go for the right players‚Äù move?

Maybe Karius too?",Liverpool,No,j6r5zdn,t3_10qm41m
"I don‚Äôt think money is an issue when it comes to signing midfielders. At this point I am confident that we are not signing midfielders because we already have enough even though they are not contributing as well. We signed Diaz, Nunez and Gakpo to replace Mane, Origi and Minamino and had no issues spending money on them.

The problem with midfield is we haven‚Äôt gotten rid of our deadweights. Milner should not be here anymore. Tangibles on the pitch is more important than tangibles off the pitch. His wages could‚Äôve been used on someone else. I don‚Äôt know if we have ever tried to offload Keita and Ox. And Hendo should not have gotten a new contract which looks very bad in retrospect. 

Klopp should be partially blamed for this as he his loyal to his players. Another issue is that we have three homegrown players here so we just can‚Äôt sign anyone to replace them without compromising another place in the squad. It‚Äôs just poor planning overall.",Liverpool,No,j6qvad4,t3_10qm41m
"Why do people hold Pep lijnders in such high regard? He's the tactics guy right? He's got a huge say on transfers no? He advised we back out of a deal for nkunku only to end up singing gakpo correct?

"I genuinely believe a good holding midfielder, our players back from injury, and a pre-season fixes our first team.

"This shit doesn't make sense thinking back. We paid more for players that are not even performing and we could have just kept Mane for like 2-3 years and paid him this.

Sick and tired of this club being mismanaged in so many ways from the backroom staff to the suits to the actual work on the training pitch to whatever bullshit Klopp comes up with next week as an excuse to play more players out of position and fucking bury us with questionable subs.

There‚Äôs a LOT that needs to happen very fast if we‚Äôre not looking to sink into mid-table obscurity while other teams overtake us. We‚Äôre realistically looking at needing five midfielders next window and an extra defender.",Liverpool,No,j6s7pyy,t3_10qm41m

"I love him to bits both as a manager and as a person but I'm starting to wonder if maybe he's having second thoughts about how far he can push this team. Maybe he's like Mary Poppins, he comes in to a broken situation, instills his philosophy on all levels, transforms the mentality and style, everyone rises to the best version of themselves as they revel in triumph ... and that's it, cut the cords and float away. Then it's time for everyone to evolve again instead of being babysat forever. It feels like we're in a *rut*.

Weird thoughts I'm having...",Liverpool,Yes,j6rbsml,t1_j6r9xu8

"That was the big one for me as well, I loved him haha. Since then I don't get too sentimental over players. Players come and go.

"Is it too late to recall Tyler Morton? I don't think he is the overall answer, but would offer more legs and has been impressing at Blackburn.

Also, with Konate being injured, I would actually start Phillips ahead of either Gomez / Matip. He never does anything to let us down and seems to actually enjoy defending. We are a soft touch.

And sod it, a 3rd option is to play a 4231. Thiago and Bajcetic in the 2, Elliott as a 10 with Gakpo left and Nunez in the middle. Can't be worse than the shower we've been seeing lately",Liverpool,Yes,j6r39nj,t1_j6r1zg0
"Low block, shit-housery, Nunez up top, Nat in defence.",Liverpool,Yes,j6r60ze,t1_j6r1zg0
"One is Bajcetic to keep playing regular minutes and see what happens and stick with it if Bajcetic hits a wall. That's key for our future. 

Would love to see Carvalho get more time too at least in attack and Elliott to play as a winger more often.

"The only theory I can come up with is that they think they'll have sold the club by the summer and so can get away without spending the money at all. Nothing else makes sense.

"Pearce put one out yesterday saying Klopp turned down any MF options in favour of signing Gakpo and after the summer, he thought he had enough depth. So Pearce is still in the pro-FSG column for now. But I‚Äôm sure Joyce will be releasing one soon saying big summer planned! 250m plus, doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs still FSG.

"I think it's a far less important factor for bigger clubs.

It's the West Hams, the Leicesters, the Brightons that suffer from not having that assurance.",Liverpool,Yes,j6uz3ty,t1_j6ulykc
"It really depends on the sporting project. Can we offer Bellingham an attractive proposition that we will build around him and challenge for major trophies? Robinho joined City instead of Chelsea at the start of Abu Dhabi's takeover. Then the likes of Dzeko, Yaya Toure, David Silva, Kolarov, and Tevez joined even though City had no CL football. You need an attractive sporting project plus offering good wages and playing time. That and a top manager (although Mark Hughes isn't what I consider a top manager).

We can offer that if we got new ownership and investment. With FSG? No chance in hell.",Liverpool,Yes,j6uni0c,t1_j6ulykc
"Aren't the rules of Champions League qualification changing next year too? I don't know much about what that means but I keep seeing people say we will likely qualify from 2024 regardless. 

As Klopp said, if a player is deterred by not playing in 1 season of Champion's League, that's not the player you necessarily want. That was directly after he praised Jude so publicly, so makes you wonder if that's been a conversation had BTS. 

If the project is good and you can see it's just because of a bad season for example and not an abject failure all around, I don't think it's a problem. Casemiro still went to United.

Unless you're going to RM, you can't guarantee CL every single year for anyone. With Arsenal, Chelsea, United and Newcastle all coming back, City may be fighting for top 4 in the next few years too.",Liverpool,Yes,j6uoony,t1_j6ulykc
"it depends.

If this was Liverpool 7 years ago before Klopp where we made CL like 2 times in 5 years, thats too much risk for top players to come to us because there was no merit. Bang average squad, bang average  coach, and no CL in sight.

The Liverpool now despite having a shit season is different. We might lose out in CL but for the past 7 years we have always been in CL, won it once and went to the finals 3 times.

We have one of the best coaches in the world and also an okay to good squad (minus the midfield) so there is way much merit for players to come here so a year without CL wouldn't be an issue for the players.

Now would our finances with current circumstances allow signing big players without CL would be a separate issue and likely would be a no.",Liverpool,Yes,j6uurrh,t1_j6ulykc

"Champions league will always have an impact for most players since playing in it will be the dream of many.

Probably when Boehly gets bored.,Liverpool,Yes,j6s9jj5,t1_j6s4akv
It already has. They screwed over Ziyech who is furious with the club. Boehly isn't middle east oil rich and is using bank loans to fund these transfers that the club will have to pay back. People think he's just out there cutting personal checks. Boehly expects to make a profit from all of this. Chelsea aren't to be revered.

"I honestly believe Klopp looks at the roster and is fine with the players he has. Why do we constantly make excuses for him? I believe that if he wanted a midfielder, he would have used the Gakpo money and got one.

"Honestly, I don't think it will be that big of an issue in the end.  I have absolutely no issue with Brighton saying no to a player with a contract and no release clause, but in all fairness, the offer(s) for him were more than fair and a player with ambition to both play at a higher level but also make a ton more money, it's also reasonable for him to push hard to get the move to happen.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rgodb,t1_j6r6ior

Not saying we‚Äôll make top 4 but we‚Äôre not in a relegation battle and not all is lost.",Liverpool,Yes,j6reaa0,t1_j6rcji1
"with how the market is shaping up, there‚Äòs no possible way to sustain success with a sell to buy philosophy.

"You know there was a good bit of time where I was delighted that we had become a ""destination club"" rather than a ""feeder club"" for Barcelona/others. 

Now i feel that has become a bit of a thorny crown. Especially now that feeder clubs like Brighton and Fulham are above us in the table.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rf3jv,t1_j6rcji1

Not too big for a relegation scrap.,Liverpool,Yes,j6rgdr0,t1_j6rcji1
"I expect a rough couple of years, followed by a fall from grace from some of the clubs up there now. Arsenal won't continue investing at the rate they are. Chelsea have taken on a huge gamble on their future finances that may end with them flat on their face. United look good now but we'll see whether ten Haag can handle it when the entitlement starts to creep in from the fanbase.

Plenty of teams looking and playing well at the moment, but everyone has downturns. We're not in a good spot right now, but I'll be very interest to see what happens to some of these clubs when they're not in their honeymoon phase. Combine that with how a bit of smart business can do a lot for a club, and while things look bad right now, they don't look bleak.

All of the above of course goes out of the window if we get sold. At that point who knows what happens.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rlaii,t1_j6rcji1
"Sums up a lot of how I feel also. Really hard to take. Had Klopp just been backed that bit more theres a fair chance we'd have at least 1 more league title and who knows with another CL. 

If you add on top, the fact we clearly need some what of a rebuild, which I'm fairly certain FSG won't adequately deliver. Then it paints a depressing picture. 

Not even going to get into the ownership and who'd be a good fit but I can't see us getting back on top without new owners willing to spend more than we have been over past few years.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rdatw,t1_j6rcwi4
"I'm with you, I started supporting during Rafa's reign. 

I thought with Klopp we've finally arrived back to our perch and ready to build a dynasty or at least a legacy. 

We need owners to match our ambitions. It doesn't need to be an owner that spends for spending sake. But someone with ambition who will spend to at least try to win.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rdtgw,t1_j6rcwi4
"Ditto. Been a supporter for a similar timeframe and feel the same. Only transfer failure before all this that I remember is only if rafa had gotten David villa to go with torres, we would have won the league in 08. That was just one though, this feels worse.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rjbgy,t1_j6rcwi4
"FSG's model of self sustainablity just isn't (ironically) sustanable, you get to a point where all you're players that were succesful all get old at the same time due to the transfer profile they go for in terms of age bracket which leads to you not being able to sell them for good money which then leads to there not being enough money to consistently make transfers to rebuild.

There's other issues mixed in with this not just their model but it definetly only gets you to a certain point before a drop off.",Liverpool,Yes,j6romgj,t1_j6rnnxb
This is a conspiracy I can get behind,Liverpool,Yes,j6rzy8f,t1_j6rwlmn
"What's more likely? A group who consistently have the same issues, bringing those issues everywhere they go... or an intangible curse that no one particular person or group can be blamed or held accountable for?

"Wait, how does that even work? How would an algorithm create an injury crisis?

And why didn't we have an injury crisis last season, when we first started using Zone7's services?",Liverpool,Yes,j6s4zj8,t1_j6rwlmn
"Tbf, we were injury for most of last season thanks to Zone7 but like our ex-physio said on twitter, they‚Äôre still not good in certain areas.

I think the main culprit is that we are still on the same program that led us to a quadruple charge with the same set of players that were involved in a quadruple charge the year before.",Liverpool,Yes,j6sb04g,t1_j6rwlmn
">Forest can even spend more than us despite being in the championship a year ago.

That's not really true though. They've spent more in transfer fees *because* they've just been promoted, not in spite of it, and have a shit tonne more money to play with than they did previously and had very low wages.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rs1t5,t1_j6qw3rj

The issue is Jude alone isn't enough. We'd need two more midfielders and honestly another center-back as well. That'd be a lot of money to spend even if FSG authorized a larger budget for the summer.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rco07,t1_j6rcazg

Winning trophies is great, but to me what is more important is that I enjoy watching us week-to-week, for that reason my personal favourite seasons to watch were 13-14 and 17-18. I just don't think that in today's competitive environment we're ever gonna have seasons like that again under FSG. 

We might have a few great CL nights and win a cup, but if it comes at the price of a long-term collapse into dull mediocrity then count me out.

And pretty sure Karius was young player of the year in Germany before he came. So again on paper not the worst signing.

">I don‚Äôt think money is an issue when it comes to signing midfielders.

I doubt it too. We all thought we didn't get a midfielder because we were broke but money for Gakpo someone came into existence. 

>At this point I am confident that we are not signing midfielders because we already have enough 

That is not a good excuse since we know we were strongly linked to Tchouam√©ni and since we got Arthur in on loan as a panic signing. Its clearly mismanagement and poor squad planning.

Besides all that, we always hear Klopp talking about prospective midfielders needing to be ""the right player"" whilst hyping up the midfielders he already has when he doesn't ever do that for other positions. We also know that regardless of their form this season, he's picked Hendo and Fabinho to play more minutes than almost any other midfielder he has and only changed things around in January. Above all, with the way we get linked to Bellingham and the fact we haven't gotten any midfielders despite being in a crisis where we've already made a significant signing makes me think those in charge only want him. Perhaps Matheus Nunes as well. And knowing Klopp's stubbornness, i think its a reasonable assessment. 

I may get downvoted but i really don't think people put enough blame on Klopp for the situation of this particular season.

On Keita and Ox: I do think we tried to sell them but they are injury prone and on a combined ¬£240k. Its probably proven too difficult to move them on.

Milner: Is actually playing well right now and not even in Midfied. The bigger question would be why he's playing RB and why Calvin Ramsey seems to not be getting chances.

Hendo: In retrospect, it looks bad because its a 4 year contract. Don't forget, he was one of our most important players in 19/20 (we tendes to play worse without him) and was very dependable in 20/21.

"Well, it's injury monitoring/prevention software that gives you stuff like ""injury risk forecasting"" and ""load management"". 

So, I'm not saying this *has* happened, but it's certainly possible that their algorithm, for example, is optimized (intentionally or not) for single-season performance in a way that actually raises the risk of injury over multiple seasons. 

To be clear, I know nothing about their algorithm or the data that it's trained with. I'm just saying that kind of thing is possible ‚Äì it certainly wouldn't be the first time a machine learning algorithm produced an undesired long-term result.

And that is one of the common pitfalls of ML: it will optimize ruthlessly for whatever ""goal"" you give it. So if it was (for example) trained with the goal of ""minimize injuries this season,"" it might well make recommendations that would have a negative impact in later seasons, because it doesn't *care* about later seasons. 

(That's kind of an oversimplified example, I imagine that Zone7's algo is probably quite a bit more complex than that. I'm just using it as an example of how this kind of thing could happen, theoretically. Not saying it did. Chances are it's just a coincidence.)",Liverpool,Yes,j6sawoy,t1_j6s4zj8

"I can almost see the logic of it to be fair, spending 30-40 million on an average midfielder probably wouldn't have made much difference to us getting past Madrid or somehow clawing our way into the top four.

Next summer is the last chance though. That's plenty of time for the club to equip themselves better to handle the rising fees for players and to nail down targets. Plus the midfield issue is so noticeable on top of the likely outgoings in Keita and Ox (and maybe Milner but I don't mind him staying on lower wages as a deep rotation option) that it's hard to avoid making additions for the midfield even beyond Jude or whoever the Jude back-up is.",Liverpool,Yes,j6r5jm8,t1_j6r59mn

15/16 isn‚Äôt a bad season. We had the EL run, some great wins in the league and a league cup final.

20/21 isn‚Äôt a bad season either. We secured top 4 and took the end of season momentum into 21/22 where we nearly completed football.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rblct,t1_j6rawpp

"I don‚Äôt believe Karius was budget option, we needed a goalkeeper and he was identified as the one and we know that turned out which led to us breaking the transfer record for a goalkeeper on Alisson.

"Well the attack would be Diaz, Gakpo, Nunez, Firmino and Jota. Elliot and Fabio could also serve as back-up.

We have seen before how it effects players when the top scorers leave (Cavani, Benzema).

I'm not saying it is easy, but if there is one part of the team where we actually have enough players to sell our best one it is definetly the attack. His sale could fund a midfielder and possibly another winger to replace him down the line. If we actually are serious about reviving the team, we can't only talk about getting rid of Hendo, Milner, Keita etc. Those won't bring money in. Out of Salah, VVD and Ali personally I think Alisson will stay at top level the longest with Salah and VVD on second place because of VVDs injury.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rxlmy,t1_j6rwobz

"> We need more than a holding midfielder, we need probably 2 more at least and another defender 

Not in terms of our first team we don't. Bring in a holding midfielder and we can play a two man midfield then 4 forward players in whatever combination we fancy.

The problem lies in when injuries or schedule force changes to that line-up. That's where we'll need players to replace our outgoings in midfield, and the defender you mention.

"The only reason 40million will get us 'average' midfielders is because we aren't savvy enough to get business done at the right times.

I wouldn't want Jorginho personally but ¬£12m this window, Sabitzer moved on loan, Mckennie moved on loan not world beaters but you don't need much to improve our midfield atm.

It just makes me laugh because we genuinely have one of the worst midfields in the league but people on here saying there's no point signing someone for ¬£40m because they'll be average. Diaz, Konate, Thiago, Salah, Mane, Robbo, Jota, Fabinho, Gini were all signed for under ¬£40m. Signing players for under that and turning them to world beaters was our thing for 6 years. Now all of a sudden It's there's no point signing someone if it's only gonna be ¬£40m haha.",Liverpool,Yes,j6s1fhh,t1_j6rxgz0

>AND you and your SOS pals want to disqualify most of the interested buyers from the bidding process with that owner review plea.

There are hundreds of different ways to run a football club and whatever Liverpool do will always be unique to Liverpool. There are people who are currently unhappy with FSG but have a tonne of reservations about a sale, people who are unhappy with FSG and want a specific kind of sale, people who just want new players and don‚Äôt care about anything else and, yes, some people who are broadly speaking happy with the last 10 years as a whole.

We desperately need to sort out a midfield, I‚Äôd actually say if we got midfielders that have the legs, keeping Bobby around would be useful.

"I think you've misunderstood my point a little here. Yes, we should have done more sooner to not end up in this position and yes, there are plenty of players who could improve the squad. I'm just saying that from their perspective that this season is a write off regardless. The 30-40 mil price point is arbitrary. Bringing in Jorginho, Sabitzer or Mckennie isn't going to win us the Champions League or get us top four this year. They're not enough to remedy the underlying systemic issues. Yes, we'd play better and win more games but from FSG's cold horrible bastard perspective that doesn't matter. Why bring someone in whose impact will be, in their eyes, immaterial? 

Then you've got another mediocre midfielder (that we'd have overpaid for as everyone knows we're desperate) clogging up the squad next year instead of Ox and Keita. More spending and more deadweight so that we can come fifth instead of seventh?

The club just uses him to try and sway public opinion in favor of them. John Henry has a history of doing this, he bough the biggest news outlet in Boston so he could control the local narrative around the red sox. No Boston Globe journalist writes bad pieces about the red sox. He's using a similar playbook here. 

One of the many Perace agenda examples was when he spent all summer defending the club and saying that we weren't going to spend because we were ""Saving up for Bellingham"". Then less than 36 hours after the summer window closed he wrote a piece saying that the club is worried the competition and price may be too high for Bellingham. It was clear as day the directive was to dangle the Bellingham carrot out to the fans to quell any complaints about spending and then once the window closes to now start the PR train of slowly walking the fans off of the Bellingham train.

He definitely is. He does actually write stuff but that's on the Athletic so no one will actually read it. 

[Here he is criticising the Super League which FSG were one of the chief architects of.](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Liverpool+simply+cannot+entertain+European+Super+League+plans+-...-a0561716518) 

This is a thread where someone is excusing abuse against him. I said that that's a ridiculous thing to say and you come in with a ""but"" it's just not the place to do it.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rzz3s,t1_j6ruhwl
And yet his comment is being downvoted at the slightest attempt at addressing the nuances of a topic of conversation....,Liverpool,Yes,j6rk1mt,t1_j6rdot0
What bit is wrong?,Liverpool,Yes,j6rixk4,t1_j6rhrpr
"No he's no underrated, why do people go to extremes just to put their point across. He's loved by all of us and there are times when he has quiet and ineffective games, but he seems to always make a goal contribution",Liverpool,Yes,j6r80x1,t1_j6r7u62
"It's so tricky, on the one hand I like that they are trying to stop Scalpers, on the other hand it really does make it hard if you can't make it to a game.",Liverpool,Yes,j6reuvr,t1_j6r8i80
">What happens if Jude doesn't sign for us, do we just throw our head in the sand like last season after Tchouameni.

No in that case then I think we have will go for an alternative because there is no other choice we literally have to, but the issue is we're so hell bent on waiting for Bellingham that its stopped us from getting someone this window.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rlmts,t1_j6rl73s
"100%, but Edwards definetly had more power and influnce over Klopp than what Ward currently seems to have.",Liverpool,Yes,j6sa336,t1_j6s8n1v

">Lol what is wrong with you?

>Why are majority of your comments anti Klopp and defending FSG?

Its amazing how some of you's can completely miss the point that I make and twist it like im Klopp out or an FSG defender when neither is the case lmfao",Liverpool,Yes,j6sing7,t1_j6shz4x
">They don't have that kind of option in midfield, especially with the Gundo/Bernardo situation.

They did sign some Argentinan kid who's supposed to be Gundogan's replacement, only way I seen them going Laivia again is if they are looking to sell Phillips but I doubt they'll give up on him when he's barely played yet.",Liverpool,Yes,j6s1mm0,t1_j6s18c8
"Yeah you always have to take it with a pinch of salt but from scrolling his account you can see he gets a fair amount correct, especially when it comes to the youth dept. seems to hit the most on loan deals / contract extensions. He's a tier above most ITKs but he's certainly no Joyce.",Liverpool,Yes,j6ubzo5,t1_j6uazd4
That is exactly what happened during his 2nd season at benfica. The team started playing better and he netted 26 goals in comparison to the 6 in his first season.,Liverpool,Yes,j6s8h9o,t1_j6s88ky
Keita's injury record was great though. It was only after signing for us he became Mr Glassman.,Liverpool,Yes,j6r7cko,t1_j6r6xof
"As I said before, Keita‚Äôs injury record was perfectly fine when we signed him. Even ox‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt bad, he only missed 5 games to injury the season before we signed him. They were the right players, they‚Äôve just been unlucky which we can‚Äôt control",Liverpool,Yes,j6r88lh,t1_j6r6xof
">I think that if we actually invested the Salah money on a decent playmaker we could see Mane + Salah numbers up top with Nunez and Gakpo in 2-3 yrs. Just look at Odegaard, KDB, Modric, Kroos etc.

This is one of the reasons for wanting Bellingham, right now halfway though the season he has 10 goals and 4 assists and this is him at 19 so he's more than capable of being a 20+ goal contribution CM for us.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rzm6w,t1_j6rz0o3
"When people start mentioning Keita being decent or playing a run of games, it's got to be bad!",Liverpool,Yes,j6swrgk,t1_j6sdwnn
"I don't think inventing a complicated conspiracy around why he actually left is really in line with Occam's Razor, mate.",Liverpool,Yes,j6t50yp,t1_j6sxln4
">highly doubt Dortmund are keeping the same valuation after the market inflation for midfielders.

There's only been 1 big money midfield signing and it was due to a release clause.",Liverpool,Yes,j6sc4ns,t1_j6savrf
"If no club wants to pay the 150m you‚Äôre saying, there simply won‚Äôt be a bidding war. Dortmund need to sell him this year because he has 2 years left on his contract so they definitely won‚Äôt be pricing any teams out of a move. Neither Us, Madrid or City will be paying 150m for him",Liverpool,Yes,j6sa31u,t1_j6s92mg

"Joined the space. One seemed confident its happening,  another one said that he doesn't see Qatar and Saudi Arabia cooperating, he also said the British media is too racist and won't allow it. They started to argue a bit and other the guy said we will see.",Liverpool,Yes,j6udz4j,t1_j6ubqs5
">I just think it's ridiculous to criticise him. You know what his job is so why criticise him for doing his job? 

If he's an opinion journalist doing his job, he's subject to criticism just like any other opinion journo surely? Once again, not insults, criticism. He gets things wrong and editorialises and feeds club PR, and he deserves some criticism for it, same as I'd criticize Barry Glendenning or someone for a shit article. It's not that deep, he's honestly just not a very good football writer and he clearly has no sources besides what the club feeds him.",Liverpool,Yes,j6t5wpd,t1_j6rzz3s
"I upvoted it, can't do much more than that.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rkcb1,t1_j6rk1mt
Considering the amount spent by the club on other attacking options when we have Jota instead of on the midfield then it feels like the club underrate him,Liverpool,Yes,j6r8oj2,t1_j6r80x1
He is underrated and I see it practically every time I'm on here. The amount of people that I've seen say he's only good for rotation or something along those lines is mind-blowing.,Liverpool,Yes,j6r89s2,t1_j6r80x1
"I like the change. I just think that it should apply to everyone or no one. I don't think season ticket holder should be able to get rid and keep their ""credit"".",Liverpool,Yes,j6rfa1m,t1_j6reuvr
Totally agree with that.,Liverpool,Yes,j6saa89,t1_j6sa336
You honestly think Edwards had the ability to overrule Klopp?,Liverpool,Yes,j6sz90d,t1_j6sm1lw
"Also, literally happened to us 2 seasons ago. It's almost like psychology, rhythm, volume and not having to create them out of nothing... makes players more likely to score.",Liverpool,Yes,j6sbnma,t1_j6s8h9o
"Understood, every player we sign is the right player, I just pray Bellingham isn‚Äôt as unlucky if we get him.",Liverpool,Yes,j6r8inh,t1_j6r88lh
"Inventing a conspiracy theory by repeating what reports stated that FSG will not commit to Mane but still use the same amount of funding and resources for duds??

Sooooooooo you have no idea what Occam's Razor means huh.

Caicedo going for 80m after being valued at 39m?,Liverpool,Yes,j6sdqka,t1_j6sc4ns
"He‚Äôs the most sought after young talent on the market next summer. He‚Äôs not going for less than Enzo. 

140-150m and both City and Real can put those numbers up.",Liverpool,Yes,j6sat28,t1_j6sa31u
"LMAO, no it wasn't me but I'm sure the reason was valid

Any way, welcome back, we missed you",Liverpool,Yes,j6t7s8z,t1_j6t7lab

"I assumed as much, just pointing out the irony.",Liverpool,Yes,j6rl14r,t1_j6rkcb1
Are there still people questioning why we bought Gakpo and Nunez?,Liverpool,Yes,j6r8yxg,t1_j6r8oj2
"And there's nothing wrong with that? Doesn't mean he's underrated. He's rated completely fairly in my opinion. A fully fit squad has Diaz, Nunez and Salah leading the strike, and this season Bobby was having one of his best seasons when he was fit.",Liverpool,Yes,j6r8wbf,t1_j6r89s2
"Caicedo hasn't went for anything yet, Brighton are just in a postion where they don't need to sell unless its insane money like ¬£90m but they would rather keep him since they have a good shot a Europe this season.",Liverpool,Yes,j6sfsi2,t1_j6sdqka
"He won‚Äôt go for less than Enzo but the only reason Enzo was that much to start with is because he had a release clause and they wanted to get him in January. It‚Äôs not that Enzo is worth 120m, in reality his value is probably around 70-80m whilst Jude‚Äôs value is probably around ¬£120m. No club will overpay for what they value him at and Dortmund knows that",Liverpool,Yes,j6sbxr9,t1_j6sat28
"I disagree and when I asked for an explanation I got threated without :

But ah well, my crusade continues

"I'm questioning why we only brought them, if we had limited resources then I would of thought starting the midfield refresh was more important than signing both of these players",Liverpool,Yes,j6r94e1,t1_j6r8yxg
You're literally underrating him here lol,Liverpool,Yes,j6ra4id,t1_j6r8wbf
"80m is already insane money for a player, even if the bid was rejected. I just don‚Äôt see Bellingham going for 110m anymore. The Caicedo bid shows that clubs will pump it up when needed and Bellingham is the mostly highly sought after midfield talent next window.",Liverpool,Yes,j6sg81h,t1_j6sfsi2
"Klopp has already answered this though? Agree with it or not, I don't care (and no, I don't agree with it either) The team bought Gakpo because he was at a much cheaper price right now due to PSV's financial issues, and Klopp expected him to help out the midfield (somehow). Also partially because of our current injuries. They didn't sign a midfielder because the team did not expect such a huge drop off in form from Henderson/Fabinho, they missed out on their initial targets Tchoumeni and weren't able to get Jude. Huge oversight obviously. I have no idea why they didn't sign a midfielder in this window, but Klopps reason is ""the right player wasnt available"".",Liverpool,Yes,j6ranwi,t1_j6r94e1
"Okay so in your opinion, Jota starts ahead of Bobby and Nunez when they're all fully fit?",Liverpool,Yes,j6raaz5,t1_j6ra4id

How many games this season have we had ‚Äúplayer x deserved to be sent off but wasn‚Äôt‚Äù and the press and club do absolutely nothing about it. And this isn‚Äôt new, as I‚Äôm well aware. I remember KBD almost having his leg broken against Palace during our centurion season and it was barely a foul. Rudiger breaks KDBs orbital bone and dodges a booking because he pretends to be injured too.   

Rashford is offside, everyone knows it, the crowd, the pundits, the players, but it‚Äôs still given and changes the game. Follow that up with ‚Äúoh yeah, next time (and every time before) that‚Äôll get blown back for offside. Whoopsie!‚Äù bullshit that we continue to get.

"He should be starting every game the rest of the season unless he can't. Guy literally had to have surgery in the summer because he played on an injured leg to get us over the line last season.

I don't think Bernardo wants to work for us tbf,Manchester City,Yes,j7cb9yn,t1_j7cb4ij
With inverted fullbacks we need number 10s. Bernardo doesn't have the final ball to play there. He can play as an 8 or as a winger. He's not a number 10. Neither is Gundogan but he's slightly better.

We move the ball so slowly that every time we manage to get the ball to a winger there's 2 opposition players in front of them which they have to take on by themselves as we don't have fullbacks.

Man all i'm trying to say is I want to see the City of the past four or five years and how we played then instead of whatever the fuck this is. The playstyle is unrecognizable to anything we've done under Pep before.,Manchester City,Yes,j7cc9j7,t1_j7cbuj0
"Yeah I think he's trying to plaster over the *teams* weaknesses, but by doing so he's sacrificing our ability to play to our players individual strengths. 

Grealish being a prime example. If you gave him support we saw at Villa what he can do if you keep leaving him in 1-on-1s but Pep is not willing to use an overlapping LB or have the 8 overlap him instead and he's just always double or tripled up on. All he can do is pass it back inside because we don't want to lose the ball above generating threat. 

Similar with Haaland. He makes so many off the ball runs but most of our team deem almost any pass too risky in the moment and prefer to keep hold of it and wait for other players to form up. 

The real shame is the players that could begin to solve these kinds of issues are the ones really out of form, injured or not currently trusted. If we could get Laporte, KDB and Foden back into the team and purring I feel like we'd be miles better. Really crap about Stones getting injured again too, and the fact Bernardo's heart just isn't in it anymore it seems.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cgco0,t1_j7cbuj0

"yeah this system potentially could work with some tweaks. A pacy, creative winger who could stretch things out and make it less narrow might elevate the system. A better back 3 who can actually do something going forward might add another dimension. (honestly this system with Laporte and Stones in there could have potential, but Stones can't stay fit and Laporte has been sent to the shadowland for some unexplained reason) that 3 ATB today was inexcusable. no wonder we didn't create shit. that line up should only play if everyone else is injured. 

A consistent line up needs to be sorted out. No one plays together anymore so there is no chemistry.",Manchester City,Yes,j7ccbkh,t1_j7caipx

No it doesn't. But its worth a try. If we don't change anything we are not going win the league forget the champions league. Gomez is technically a good player. Defensively he's bad but that's what we have. Bernardo is class when he's next to Rodri with traditional fullbacks. He doesn't have the final delivery to play in his current role. What's the point in playing Haaland if youre not going to find him.,Manchester City,Yes,j7celnp,t1_j7cdxta

"In possession it makes sense to play both on the right? unless you're throwing someone else forward to contend with a back 5. 

The issue is out of possession, if Lewis is a RB that puts Walker at CB in our block, which in theory isn't a problem but it is a different role. More space to track, you can't use the sideline, something I think Walker relies upon a lot. 

And Pep mentioned Lewis at LB not long ago so it could legit just be LB Lewis. I hope it goes well for him if it is though.",Manchester City,Yes,j7bin55,t1_j7bhot6
"For a second I thought you meant to all be sold I was like WHAT

But yeah, I mean. If it's really really needed we could do that, double pivot of Gundo and Bernardo for a game or two to give Rodders a rest. 

Perrone was on the bench which is a good sign. Hopefully he is to our level already.

We've chopped and changed the back line way too much also this season. Really shit that Stones is injured again, I feel like he's the only other player, bar Walker that Pep plays in the RCB position. 

I can understand Ake is playing well enough to keep Laporte out of the team atm, and Pep doesn't seem to want him in the middle, it's LCB or nothing (For Laporte).   
But Dias should've probably been in there instead of Akanji, not that he was particularly woeful tbf. 

But it feels like the RB situation has really fucked stuff around. Walker has had an off (mainly through injury) season, Lewis has been great but is so young Pep doesn't want him playing every game. But Pep can't play both of them on the right so things were changed again to get Lewis in at LB which changes things for Ake etc etc

Feels like we need stability. I think he should probably, at this point say ok. Lewis is our starter. Ake-Dias-Akanji-Lewis will be our back 4 for the next X amount of games and let it meld for a while. 

Laporte can come in for Ake just fine. If Stones is fit I'd prefer him over Akanji. But the fact Walker can only really be this static RB is a pain, he can't invert and he struggles with being a full CB. The only other way I can see him playing is you let him off the leash as a flying attacker, but you have to have Bernardo in midfield to drop next to Rodri if you do that. You need to get Mahrez the ball, have him stand up his man and let Walker overlap constantly.

Which is what Grealish has never had btw. He's constantly on his own and more than anything, I feel like getting in a LB might unlock Jack even more than just solidifying our defence.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cezc8,t1_j7ccgnu
"Lol I listen to all kinds of music when I'm happy, sad, angry, etc. It definitely helps me get through the hard times for sure though. Maybe we all need to listen to some music for the rest of our games.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cauf1,t1_j7ca9y4
That's the thing though. Peps not going to give up all the control just for Grealish to be running at players with Ake overlapping.,Manchester City,Yes,j7cbahw,t1_j7canmy
"The 3-2-5, 3-2-1-4 shape is fine. Just don't have the perfect personnel for it.

Like, that back 3 needs Laporte. Build up is awful without him.

Using Bernardo as a 10 kinda ruins it because he doesn't compliment Haaland too.

We didn't use the half spaces too well.

Squad balance right now is bad and that's on the club and him too. Cancelo's departure could be explained tactically but doing it now with 0 replacement is baffling. 

And I like Palmer but replacing Sterling with someone like him is simply surprising. And don't say Sterling's final action is bad, Palmer's is worse, his profile was valuable and wasn't replaced.",Manchester City,Yes,j7ccv6q,t1_j7cc9j7
">the fact Bernardo's heart just isn't in it anymore it seems.

Can't say it's reflected in his performances, today's at least. As a 10, he's simply lost the ability to penetrate with passes. 

Anyway, do agree. There are players who can solve some of our issues but aren't favoured or injured. 

1) City's build-up without Laporte is inferior. Use him, and City can construct attacks better.

2) Foden's verticality is what City need, play him in advanced positions near Haaland.

3) Gundogan too. As an advanced 8 he offers verticality and movement. 

Other issues but the summer can only solve them.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cgu7n,t1_j7cgco0

"I think our defense is fine tbh, we aren‚Äôt really leaking too many goals. Its not perfect but not a crisis. I would say all the goals against Spurs were due to stupid mistakes and completely avoidable. However, unlike the game at the Etihad we didn‚Äôt score goals. Haaland and Alvarez were just completely frustrated by Spurs‚Äô defense, who are a bunch of cunts tbf. Our greatest strength has been creating chances but we‚Äôve just been missing that for some reason and until we bring that back we won‚Äôt get the job done in the future.

Might be wrong, but I think it‚Äôs down to KDB. He finds form, starts unlocking opponents, and we will win games. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up with him, maybe the WC really fucked with his head, but I hope he starts doing his thing again.

What do you feel Laporte does specifically that Ake doesn't? because it feels at the moment like Ake is playing really well and is keeping Laporte out the team. Pep seems to trust him a lot and really rate him highly at the moment and when I watch him play his passing is really great and I think he is better defensively than Laporte. But I also feel like Laporte just has something Ake doesn't but I'm not sure what it is specifically. 

Off the top of my head I feel like he sits wider when he passes down the line to the winger, and has more of a threat to find the 8 as well than Ake does. And perhaps picks 'safer' passes, meaning to players that aren't as pressured. But I'd like your insight. 

I agree on Gundogan and Foden. It's just a shame Gundo is probably tired and Foden is so out of form at the moment.",Manchester City,Yes,j7ciy6q,t1_j7cgu7n

"Rico? If you're not going to play inverted fullbacks he would be just as bad but right footed. He's a few years away from being a starter. Reason for playing Gomez is that he's a good crosser, technically decent and most importantly left footed.",Manchester City,Yes,j7ci4lk,t1_j7ch87u
"https://preview.redd.it/s63v85tsvgga1.jpeg?width=1031&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=82b7b1d4ddd080040f5259edab717699973f567d

I'm suggesting this lineup (dropping Haaland, playing bernardo deeper and switching to traditional fullbacks) so we can move the ball quicker and have some fluidity. The reason those players have been so bad is that we are static.",Manchester City,Yes,j7civy8,t1_j7cgcqi
Gomez being a failed winger was the reason he was converted into a LB,Manchester City,Yes,j7cgelv,t1_j7cf041
I don't know if he has the dribbling tbh. But I don't think he's that much worse than Rico/Zinchenko/Cancelo defensively.,Manchester City,Yes,j7cfo95,t1_j7cf041

That's awesome! I need to listen to those some time üíô,Manchester City,Yes,j7cbxub,t1_j7cbfx5
"Yea, totally. We were probably not ready for Haaland. All of our team was geared towards a false nine system. Maybe Alvarez is a better fit for us. I'm not so sure.

Maybe we could play Gomez and Foden on the left and Alvarez through the middle as he's more comfortable on the ball. If we move the ball quicker and switch play more often most of our problems could be solved.",Manchester City,Yes,j7ccgf2,t1_j7cbtxk
"Judging by the way we're playing, and the way that Leipzig are playing atm in terms of their style and personnel, I wouldn't be surprised if we lose by a 2 goal deficit in the first leg.

As it is, we have to go to Arsenal before that, so good luck to them on that, I guess...",Manchester City,Yes,j7cyhlr,t1_j7cdkt5
"You are right, Ake's a phenomenal pure defender, which is why I love him, but the biggest difference between him and    Laporte is the ability on the ball. Switches of play to wingers, clipped passes to runners to progress play, tidy progressive passes from first to second play. 

Remember Ake's back pass to Ederson v Spurs a few weeks back, where Ederson makes a terrible blunder. But put Laporte in that situation, and City might not have conceded that. No Ake hate though, crazy defender. 

>I agree on Gundogan and Foden. It's just a shame Gundo is probably tired and Foden is so out of form at the moment.

Yes.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cjfzn,t1_j7ciy6q
">What do you feel Laporte does specifically that Ake doesn't? because it feels at the moment like Ake is playing really well and is keeping Laporte out the team. Pep seems to trust him a lot and really rate him highly at the moment and when I watch him play his passing is really great and I think he is better defensively than Laporte. But I also feel like Laporte just has something Ake doesn't but I'm not sure what it is specifically.

It's pretty obvious tbh. The weightage, choices, and directions of pass are varied and most of the time correct, and he isn't all that fearful of playing a driven ball to break the lines.  Watching Ake's passing most of the time is futile as he's always playing the same safe options, which while in theory should have us keep the ball better against teams that aren't interested in engaging with our backline, doesn't help in games like this against quality opposition. It's not obvious since alot of our CBs will have many sideways passes as a result of our system, but you can see when he plays as to his capability of playing a line breaker, or even pass in a way where the midfielders play forward without needing to do much to clean up the initial pass received. If you notice, he gestures quite a bit during the build up to help the team progress or retain the ball at the back successfully, especially when it comes to encouraging our players to use Ederson more.

Tbh, I also have the same criticism of Stones at times, but unlike Ake, he does have the ability to be more incisive on the ball.

I actually thought we found a great role for Ake in this flexi LCB/LB shutdown wide defender role where all of the burdens in possession aren't on him, but it seems like we essentially reverted to the United gameplan in the back, albeit with Lewis inverting, instead of Joao out wide, which meant alot of the burden fell on Ake to break the lines.

For a coach who rates passing ability so highly to a fault, it is surprising that Pep's actively played our worst ball players in the back in so many big games this season, let alone, in many of the other games.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cwjak,t1_j7ciy6q
"Absolutely, too afraid to spend. Who cares what's people are going to say they are going to say anyway so just spend.",Manchester City,Yes,j7ceyih,t1_j7ccmq7
"Nah. If they spent 100m on Jack because Pep was getting turned on by his ball-retention and foul baiting, then I don't think you can blame the spending. 

If anything, what's clear is Pep's made a choice by going for this style of play, and the club serve him on that in terms of the recruitment. I wouldn't be surprised if he genuinely comes out and believes that this personnel is fine in playing in this way.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cz1h3,t1_j7ccmq7
I was talking about Haaland. Without him we would be midtable,Manchester City,Yes,j7cjtrr,t1_j7ci4lk
"Definitely need to see more Foden. I don't think Pep trusts Gomez and I wouldn't mind Alvarez having a good run of games to prove himself. 

But yeah completely agree about moving the ball quicker and switching the play. Nothing makes me more upset then having a counter attacking opportunity only for us to pass back to the half way line and then lose the ball anyway.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cd864,t1_j7ccgf2
I lowkey agree but I didn't want to say it.,Manchester City,Yes,j7cymwr,t1_j7cyhlr
"I said it in a reply to OP, but it is weird that Pep's all of sudden actively playing his worst ball players at the back, when to a fault, he used to rate the passing ability of his players too highly at the expense of their other flaws.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cx196,t1_j7cjfzn
"I do think Ake does those things, just maybe not as consistently or as often as Laporte can.",Manchester City,Yes,j7d1bel,t1_j7cwjak
We've been alright without him in the last 2 seasons. I don't blame him but we don't have the player profiles to make it work at the moment and pep won't give up the control to get the best out of Haaland in transitions. Alvarez is more comfortable on the ball. With him we can lean on last 2 years winning formula.,Manchester City,Yes,j7ckjvt,t1_j7cjtrr
"Hmmm

I don't deny that he has improved somewhat in that aspect, but we'll agree to disagree on his capability of doing it, since it's very clear against the bigger teams that it does hinder us on the ball.",Manchester City,Yes,j7d1k0l,t1_j7d1bel
I'm not disagreeing that Ake isn't as good. But I think he's maybe not as far behind Laporte as pictured. But against the bigger teams maybe that is where he tends to play safer etc.,Manchester City,Yes,j7d3zcj,t1_j7d1k0l
"From what I've seen, his shortcomings aren't exposed against crappier teams or teams that play more fearfully against us teams due to obvious talent gaps. So he's able to look better.

That same playstyle however looks much meeker against bigger opposition, which requires him to do more on the ball, which I suspect he's hit his ceiling on imo.",Manchester City,Yes,j7d4yqi,t1_j7d3zcj

Honestly thought they had signed the perfect manager when I heard about allardyche. They need someone to steady the ship after the revolving door of managers they‚Äôve had since moyes left. Everton used to be so tough to play against. Hopefully they won‚Äôt be against us though!,Manchester City,Yes,j76rzcr,t1_j76qpg8
"His YouTube masterclass was one of the more eloquent ones there. Very clear and unapologetic.

Bernardo I can understand. But why do they want Laporte? They already have decent CBs,Manchester City,Yes,j7ao26t,t1_j7al3rw
"Wouldn't be surprised at this tbh. 










Barca have been flirting with Bernardo for like at least two seasons now, and it's well known he wants to move closer to home. The interesting thing, is I'm not at all surprised if the Laporte thing has some truth behind it, I think he would fit their style of play perfectly and he's been unhappy whenever he hasn't been starting every game. 








I think this would indicate we're going for another CB (hopefully Gvardiol?) since Stones/Dias/Ak√©/Akanji would not be enough depth given Dias and/or Stones are usually out for periods of the season and Ak√© is seeing more and more minutes at LB. 












Youth leaving is never nice to see, but I'm not surprised either. Imagine being a young academy player trying to break into our first team with the quality of players we have. I'd imagine it'll be similar to Lavia + Bazanu where we sell them but have a reasonable buy-back clause. 












Can imagine we're gonna be spending big in summer if we move on Cancelo, Laporte, Bernardo + youth players.",Manchester City,Yes,j7av3te,t1_j7al3rw

Yeah cancelo to Madrid makes sense to me also (would then have a good shot at winning all 5 top leagues). They're definitely in need of a younger RB or a less injury prone lb. A nice buy one get one 10m off deal for real would be good for the 2 Portuguesers.,Manchester City,Yes,j77fe14,t1_j77earg

Yeah if we could get...¬£100m our of Madrid for Cancelo and Bernardo? it's a bit of a discount for Madrid for two players of that quality but we'd also get these players who don't want to be here off the books and that would almost pay for Bellingham itself. Then we can spend big dealing with LB and winger.,Manchester City,Yes,j77gw9v,t1_j77fe14

"I'm feeling confident Gundo will stay for a bit longer recently. But I agree we should try and get cover there anyway. A lot depends on what level Perrone is to be honest, he's the one factor I can't really equate with anything. 

But right now it feels like the dream window would be selling Bernardo and Cancelo. And bringing in Bellingham, Kvara, Davies then bring in Tielemans and Guerreiro on frees for added depth. 

You can add Laporte leaving for Gvardiol and even Phillips for Lavia too. But that's the kind of window I think would really transform the team and shore up our weaknesses.",Manchester City,Yes,j77i2sv,t1_j77h73f

Grealish and Foden are not wingers at all and they're one dimensional. We need a direct pacey winger this summer. The attack is too stable. And yes Leao is not a pep player but he is pretty young and can develop more under pep. On paper Haaland is also not a pep type no 9 but under pep he will develop more and more.

I don't think he's going to be out of form forever and even Grealish has improved now. Personally I would rather wait for the right player. Midfield and Left back are more of a priority.

"No worries at all! I‚Äôm American as well but I‚Äôll do my best to describe it

I shredded some carrots and chopped an onion and seasoned those and cooked all the moisture out in a pan. Once that was looking dry I added a few pounds of ground beef and seasoned that as well. Once the beef was browned I added a little tomato paste and cooked that off for a minute. Then I added a half cup of flour. The flour helps the meat base stay thick for the remainder of the process. Once the flour was cooked off after a minute or two I added a large amount of beef stock, some Worcestershire sauce, some garlic powder and a squeeze of some stone ground mustard. I let that simmer for a while and added a full bag of frozen peas to lower the temperature of the beef and get the base set. Once the peas were mixed in the base was looking thick, it was done.

In a separate pot, I had peeled and been boiling 4 large potatoes in some salty water. Once the potatoes started to fall apart (just past fork tender) I drained all the water and added the potatoes back to the same pot. I added a a stick of butter, a splash of milk, 2 egg yolks and a full block of aged white cheddar to the potatoes and started mashing. I got a micro plane for Christmas and also mixed in a clove of garlic to the mash with some rosemary. 

Once the potatoes were mashed and the texture was smooth, I spread the potatoes over the top of the meat base in an oven friendly dish. I used cast iron. You want to try and get the potatoes as even as possible and spread from edge to edge in the pan. Once it looks relatively even, I started on the outside edge with a normal fork and worked a spiral going inwards. The more cracks and crevices in the potato top means more crispy brown bits in the final product. I baked it for about 30 minutes til the I could see the base was bubbly around the edges and the potato top looked puffy. Last thing I did was put it under the broiler/grille for about 90 seconds and it was done!

It tasted like a slightly looser meatloaf topped in super cheesy and a bit crispy mashed potatoes. For a first try at it I was insanely satisfied with how good it turned out but I think I might use less tomorrow paste next time to go for more of a ‚Äúbeefy‚Äù flavor. Absolutely recommend it.

I see a lot of david silva's qualities in wirtz though which neither phil or bernardo really turned out to have. We're on the brink of a generational shift either way so there's no guarantee that our system is going to stay the same in a season or two.,Manchester City,Yes,j72nfhw,t1_j72jtz5
"Yeah I saw that too. Looked up his stats after seeing it haha. Normally with players like KDB or Odegaard their passing numbers, in terms of completion and pure numbers, are actually kinda low but their key passes, through passes xA and all that are like elite of the elite. 

It's players like Gundo and Silva and Bernardo who have that full green passing stats, just good at it all, involved a lot, and that's what Dominik has. 

David Silva even comes up as a match on FBREF but that's obviously current Silva not at hie height our Silva (although he's still doing very well for Soceiadad) 

Seems great at set pieces, and for a midfielder, although he doesn't seem very successful at tackling people he tries to quite a bit. As long as the work rate is there I think we can be somewhat happy as we press in numbers. 

Doesn't seem great at dribbling but doesn't get dispossessed a lot which is great.

So yeah. Looks very promising, looking forward to watching him. Just hope all that xA doesn't fall to Nkunku's feet tbh. It's going to be a super tough tie, Leipzig are flying atm.",Manchester City,Yes,j74efhb,t1_j747erb

"True the system will change when Pep leaves. I disagree about Wirtz personally, he might have some qualities of a Silva but I think he's a very creative risk-taker like KDB, loses the ball too much to be a Silva or Gundogan in our team.

He is super young though so he could definitely be trained up, the talent is there. But if that's how you see him fair enough. Would be fun to get someone like that for sure, I'm just not sure this summer is the time if we're going after one or two LBs, a winger, and potentially fighting for Bellingham.",Manchester City,Yes,j72p4bp,t1_j72nfhw
"Yeah that's maybe the issue. Since he's already been out on loan it might be difficult to convince him to be third string. I think we keep both Ederson and Ortega obviously. 

I'm not sure about the Bazunu buy-back honestly. Maybe we just sling it with two keepers?",Manchester City,Yes,j73meaf,t1_j73hjqh

"I wonder if the reason we're going for Chilwell is because Carson might retire, Sterling was already sold, Palmer might go out on loan and Phillips/Walker have been linked with potential sales. 

Means out home-grown quota would only be 5 players? Jack, Ake, Stones, Foden, Rico. 

We're only at 14 of our 17 non-homegrown quota but That could be one reason our squad is so small, we have to buy home-grown to make it substantially bigger. If Cancelo and Bernardo are sold that's gives us more space though.",Manchester City,No,j6zhnkx,t3_10rqhkp

"The way I see it is how I saw things with Klopp going to Liverpool. When he went, I thought how can city seriously let Klopp go to Liverpool? We had to have something better in the pipelines (and we did).

From a personal standpoint, I think this is a similar situation. Rice is a top player and English too so he adds to our homegrown quota, which will be important if we lose the likes of Walker/Carson/Phillips in the next season or two.

"If you're talking about them as a CB pair then nah I don't agree. Great pure defenders but against high intensity teams and in bigger games you'll want an elite ball playing cb like Stones or preferably Laporte.

>>***A rating of 1-10***, *10 being the safest, and 1 concerning. No 10 and 1 on the list, because nothing's certain in football.*

**Mahrez**: **8/10**. A good example for players on bench that their time to perform will come. 


**Ederson**: **9/10**, **Ortega 9/10**


**Walker:  5/10**. He is disgruntled at losing his place in the team since the World Cup, also is getting old.


**Ake: 9/10**. His attitude when not picked by Pep last season delighted Pep. Been one of our most consistent starters.


**Laporte: 6/10**. In Jan 2021 he asked to go, but nothing really materialised. Also been unhappy with his game time in recent weeks. His future is dependent on how much he starts until the next transfer window.


**Dias: 9/10**. He is a *key* voice in the dressing room. He is not on Pep's list of concerns. 


**Stones: 8/10**. Pep blamed Stones for his injury against arsenal, but nothing's out of ordinary. Safe.


**Akanji: 9/10**. Getting plenty starts. 

**Cancelo: 3/10**. Very unlikely that he will be back in the city squad next season. 


**Gomez: 4/10**. Not yet at City's level, and considered by City as somebody who could be moved on in the next transfer seasons. Loan likely, transfer not off the table either. 

**Rodri: 9/10**. No issues with him. 


**Kevin de Bruyne: 9/10**. No issues with him either.

**Gundogan: 6/10**. His contract expires next season, is 32, is he is attracting suitors from Barcelona among other European clubs. Gundo himself is keen to stay, however. His wife about to give birth, so he would want stability.


**Silva: 5/10**. Would leave if we get a good offers for him, ""preferably from Spain"".


**Phillips: 5/10**. Rumblings from the club that a transfer is not off the cards. He has to prove himself in the eyes of the club if he wants to stay. 


**Foden: 9/10**. Ofcourse. He is city through and through. 


**Julian: 9/10**. Might sign a new & better contract here, if anything. 


**Haaland: 9/10**. No concerns whatsoever. 


**Jacky Grealish: 9/10**. He is a key part of Pep's plan, and is more than happy at City. 


**Palmer: 6/10**. Fewer minutes under his belt compared to last season. City has noted a drop in his confidence, possibly due to injury that kept him out of second half of the season. City are looking for a winger, so palmer's future is uncertain. Might go on a loan.",Manchester City,No,j6whscf,t3_10qwrpb

Sick of the sight of him in that kit already,Manchester City,No,j6tjoz6,t3_10qwrpb
Cancelo great assist within 20 minutes for Bayerns opener. I'm hoping he plays to such a ridiculously high level for them that they'll just pay the 70M option. Not a high chance of that happening but they did spend 80M on Lucas Hernandez (who was a lot younger than Cancelo though),Manchester City,No,j6tk279,t3_10qwrpb

2] They fully trust whatever pep decides with regards to holding LB down until the Summer.",Manchester City,No,j6szor2,t3_10qwrpb
Bayern getting a world class player capable of reviving their season for free is annoying. Couldn't we have signed Coman on loan or something? They've got so much pace in their squad.,Manchester City,No,j6tm657,t3_10qwrpb
"Saw Moneyball again yesterday and hope anyone that thinks all we need is a world class player in XYZ position to solve our problems watches it too.

"The issue with that is Txiki was sure we could get our CB target Koulibaly. Napoli didn't play ball. He was sure we would get our striker target Kane, Spurs didn't play ball. He was sure we would solve our LB issues by getting in Cucurella. Brighton didn't play ball. 

I don't doubt they have replacements in mind but I think Txiki maybe overestimates our position sometimes and seemingly thinks things will easily get done, and when it turns out they don't, they turn to the 'don't panic buy' mantra, which is fine but if it keeps happening, you end up where we currently are, where you haven't had a nailed LB starter since Kolorov. 

I think he needs to have a shortlist of several players we would be happy to get because he misses out on our primary target quite a bit. Maguire, Sanchez, Jorginho, Fred. Whatever you may think of the players they were big targets for us and we didn't get it done. Maybe we don't get Bellingham done either? 

Maybe Pep can get away with not having a plan B and sticking to his philosophy, but I think Txiki needs a plan B and C if we're going to strengthen the squad in the way it needs to be.",Manchester City,Yes,j6tj7bf,t1_j6szor2

"Before WW arrives, EtH practically had no strikers for most games of the first half of the season. He is so good at getting the best out of players at his disposal.

Yesterday was a showpiece of team spirit atm, from the beautiful moments that led to the second goal to the way that the team sticked together and ran their asses of in the last 20 minutes. Not having Case for the next 3 games is a problem for sure, but if the team continues to believe in themselves and keep working hard, I have high hope that they will be able to pull off good results.",Manchester United,No,j7a7mec,t3_10u5d5h

Towards start of game in opening 10 mins, he put in a wonderful cross in the box using a technique I didn't think he had. His development has been brilliant to see in his overall attacking play. He also played his part in that second goal in which he kept the momentum going. Often times prior to this season he'd have potentially been the player slowing that phase of play down.

He's always going to have his haters and because some people don't find him easy on the eye, will jump onto any opportunity to shit on him like the Arsenal match where people wanted him gone.

But, to me, he's more than proving his use and has had another fantastic turnaround. ETH has worked wonders and ABW's attitude also seems brilliant. Not the type of player to sulk when he was given no chances pre-World Cup and once he got his chance in the League Cup match v Burnley, has not looked back. With Dalot returning who was also brilliant pre-World Cup, we have two very good rights backs for the rest of the season who depending on the game, will have their uses.

"The selective bias of VAR is absolutely shocking.  

VAR is supposed to intervene if the ref has made a clear and obvious error.  If a punch had been thrown or an elbow or a kick, or if Casemiro really *had* attempted to throttle Hughes, then fine.  But the MOTD replay last night shows this was not the case.  And Casemiro and Hughes were hugging each other about 3 seconds later, does this really happen if Casemiro was throttling Hughes?

If it were the other way around, and a Palace player had done what Cas did, even with the misleading slo-mo angle I would have fully expected to see ""VAR checking for possible red card""  flash up on screen, and moments later seen the old ""VAR check complete"" message, and the game moves on, and I and everyone else would have been fine with it... as long as it is consistent!

Read someone last night criticising United fans for their use of ""whataboutism"" arguments.  But how else are you supposed to point out hypocrisies or inconsistencies without using ""whataboutisms""?  Really hate that term, because 9 times out of 10 the term is used as an attempt to delegitimise perfectly legitimate arguments, as if it to say ""aha, you used a whataboutism, therefore you've lost the argument"", as if that's the trump card or something.

VAR was supposed to make the game fairer, but it's actually doing the opposite.  The completely inconsistent and selective way in which it is being applied is making the game worse, not better.

And the worst thing is, it's very unlikely they will come out and say they got it wrong, they never explain any of their baffling decisions... most the time they bottle making any kind of decision, so I'd like them to come out and explain why they chose this particular incident, based on one angle (that turns out to be highly misleading) and just a few frames of motion to come to their decision.  If it was a human error in the heat of the moment, then fine, come out and say that!  Otherwise justify why Casemiro was singled out here.

However, I would like to ask people who think he should continue being our number 1, do you really think he is good enough on the ball? I know he is somewhat doing the job right now, but Ten Hag had to sacrifice some parts of our game to accomodate him.

We have had 156 goal kicks in the Prem this season and Martinez has taken 58 of them, that's around a third of all goal kicks we had (De Gea himself with 94). That's a crazy number and it's quite a clear indication Ten Hag doesn't trust De Gea under pressure. You won't find such high number anywhere else, the second highest number of goal kicks taken by an outfielder is Gabriel from Arsenal at 14.

In comparison, Man City outfielders have taken 5 goal kicks for Ederson while he himself took 92. 

De Gea's passing doesn't seem to be a problem often because Ten Hag doesn't allow him to get into risky positions with the ball. That's not a good thing though, a good passer could play through the risk and get us a big advantage 9 times out of 10.

"I really wish people wouldn‚Äôt view criticism of de gea as hate. I love the guy, he‚Äôs for sure a United legend, however I think it would be best if we got a new keeper this summer. It‚Äôs not a coincidence that often the final signing a team makes before winning major trophies is a goalkeeper. 
Liverpool - signed Alison won the league
City - Signed Ederson became centurions 
Milan - Signed maignan ended a 10 year wait for the league 
Arsenal - signed Ramsdale look to be on course to win the league.

I think part of it has to do with many old school fans on this subreddit, who view goalkeeping as being primarily shotstopping, everything else comes next. But this isn‚Äôt true, preventing shots is just as important as making a save.

"We are in a great spot right now compared to previous years, but I just cannot shake this idea that the Weghorst experiment caused a confusion in our attack for the Palace and Arsenal games, games which I if we won we'd be in a serious title race right now.

I know we have to use PERSPECTIVE, where we have come from, but the difference in performance when Martial came on towards the end of the palace game was levels different. This is simply because Bruno is 3 times the player with 3 fast forwards in front of him. 

I honestly worry about Weghorst not being able to fit in our side simply because he is not fast enough to keep up with the play.

Weghorsts first chance vs Palace came with a very nice through ball from Bruno, a ball played well, that Weghorst was not able to get on the end of simply due to pace, he's quite slow.

People wont like this, but these performances he's putting in are frankly like playing with 10 men, or just no striker.

"We're still in 4 competitions. If we stay in them all, we have 3 spare mid-weeks and 3 weekend clashes (e.g. Feb 26th was supposed to be PL vs Brentford but now we have the League Cup final).

If we stay in all 4 competitions, we have to play 2 matches a week for the rest of the season.",Manchester United,Yes,j7agd9w,t1_j7a4u0u
"Yeah the wise thing here was not to complain about Casemiro's red but to ask why other cases aren't being treated the same.

There's general displeasure about refereeing right now and managers should band together to complain.",Manchester United,Yes,j7amnfz,t1_j7am136
It's a shame Bielsa isn't still there.,Manchester United,Yes,j7ca0ww,t1_j7c58cu
"Rashford after his eighth hatrick: ""I could do this all day"".",Manchester United,Yes,j7c7tp1,t1_j7c58cu
"that's part of football, you take the good with the bad",Manchester United,Yes,j7c69k2,t1_j7c5tpu
All part of the learning curve. Probably would've dropped points yesterday if we didn't drop them in Selhurst Park,Manchester United,Yes,j7c686n,t1_j7c5tpu
"Ehh, that's the same but saying the start of the season instead. Had we not shit the bed, neither would've Arsenal or City done that. It's the beauty of the game that all games matters, only you don't know which one will be the heaviest result.",Manchester United,Yes,j7c8zmm,t1_j7c5tpu
"Yeah. All Antony needs to do to become truly world class is develop his right foot. He's elite cutting in on his left and like you said his defensive work rate is top tier. Once he can fake inside, go outside and put in killer crosses with his right from the touchline, our front line will get a massive level up",Manchester United,Yes,j7afijz,t1_j7aedzl
"Agreed..i might be wrong, but that slope is there to accommodate heating n drainage since 1980‚Äôs
But when i try to find photos of newer stadiums, they don‚Äôt have slope like OT, meaning they are old tech/design
OT need some major renovations and catch up with the latest tech/inventions",Manchester United,Yes,j7a6yg7,t1_j7a661j
"They should find a way to make it less dangerous for sure. At the same time, the closer the stand is to the pitch the better because that can help improve engagement between fans and our players while put more pressure on visiting teams.",Manchester United,Yes,j7a843a,t1_j7a661j
Weren‚Äôt we the comeback kings the season before last? Then mentality totally went to shit the very next season,Manchester United,Yes,j7acfqi,t1_j7ac1ng
"He and the VAR team had a really poor game yesterday, like embarrassingly bad.",Manchester United,Yes,j7aie88,t1_j7ahhqp
Did you see him even tackle Bruno?üò≠ on my life he‚Äôs a garbage referee.,Manchester United,Yes,j7ajcps,t1_j7ahhqp
"Yes he was terrible yesterday, but I don't think the red card is on him. He was only shown one angle of the incident. The VAR crew should be blamed for that.",Manchester United,Yes,j7akeyi,t1_j7ahhqp
I can‚Äôt believe we have to play barca 3 days before the cup final. Worried it will be like the arsenal game when we played palace midweek and they had a week off. We couldnt keep up for 65 minutes+,Manchester United,Yes,j7aqf8s,t1_j7alx8a
looks like we are gonna win all 8 obviously,Manchester United,Yes,j7apkgv,t1_j7alx8a

Genius,Manchester United,Yes,j7b3sbp,t1_j7b3asc
Unfortunately we have to hope City win today as well so that Tottenham can be further from the top 4. Feels sick to do that but that would cap off a perfect weekend in terms of the table,Manchester United,Yes,j7acj6q,t1_j7a93tk
But Licha will miss that Barca fixture,Manchester United,Yes,j7a9q9o,t1_j7a93tk
Far from perfect. We lost Casemiro for the next three matches. It‚Äôs a pretty good weekend but not perfect.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b25sf,t1_j7az9a6

"Sabitzer's highest ratings in his past 50 matches have come playing as defensive midfield.

It'll be Sabitzer, Fred and Bruno in midfield",Manchester United,Yes,j7alebl,t1_j7al97p
Sabitzer seems to have more directness to his play but yeah them two with casemiro behind will run the legs off any team,Manchester United,Yes,j7at41p,t1_j7arz0s
Loved seeing his tenacity. That tackle and pass to Rashford is exactly what I'd want to see of him. Someone who can press and play to the pace we want to play.,Manchester United,Yes,j7agwjs,t1_j7ag1hi
Sad it is only a loan deal tho not buy out option :(,Manchester United,Yes,j7aitpv,t1_j7ag1hi
The pressing and anti-press of Sabitzer's cameo got me drooling.,Manchester United,Yes,j7agtru,t1_j7ag1hi
"Something I noticed is he actually won a back post header! Considering it‚Äôs been a huge criticism of him, even when he‚Äôs been playing well so that was great to see, hopefully he just keeps getting better and better!",Manchester United,Yes,j7asfw3,t1_j7aknjk
"Bro they just have a legitimate goal an offside against Wolves just a couple of weeks back.

There is no competency here. It‚Äôs a group of hippies.",Manchester United,Yes,j7afzrn,t1_j7add5q
Our confidence surging with him coming back into the team will happen in the first Barcelona game. That's ideal timing.,Manchester United,Yes,j7aj57c,t1_j7aj0sg
"As annoying as it is, it gave me great joy seeing the whole team swarm together to back Antony. It's night and day compared to last year. They are together, and this will just build the mentality like you said. Hopefully it's not the worst games to be out for and Sabitzer looks we up for it. Something special is brewing up here!",Manchester United,Yes,j7aoove,t1_j7aj0sg
"I feel like sabitzer is gonna help. But without both Erickson and Carlos, it feels unpredictable since they have been our main guys this season, winning in the midfield consistently.",Manchester United,Yes,j7akaio,t1_j7aj0sg
Arsenal also have a game in hand,Manchester United,Yes,j7arjig,t1_j7ar4ro

"Yeah livramento looked absolutely incredible for his age before his injury

Another Chelsea masterstroke letting him go",Manchester United,Yes,j7b3f2q,t1_j7b2jgv
Bella kotchap looked pretty good in some matches I saw,Manchester United,Yes,j7b5mdq,t1_j7b2jgv
I think Lavia is from the City youth and they might have a buyback/ refusal apparently,Manchester United,Yes,j7bagj4,t1_j7b2jgv
I love the fact that this applies to both Leeds and Liverpool this season,Manchester United,Yes,j7blw5b,t1_j7bkr0q
"It shouldn't concern you too much. Points are what matter more than anything. We conceded 6 in the first two matches of the season and 6 in one match against City. That's 12 goals across 3 matches, which means we've only conceded 14 through the other 18 matches in the league this season.

Defensive solidity is always the first priority for new managers, and we've come a long way since Erik joined. Our attack has been suffering from injuries and other issues yet we're still winning matches, that's what's most important. We'll get better and better in the attacking phases the more time we have on the training ground (and when our players get back to full fitness).",Manchester United,Yes,j7cy6q2,t1_j7chku2
who cares? Points matter first and foremost and it's not like the rest of the pack have superior GD so at the worst we'll be 4th,Manchester United,Yes,j7cxhit,t1_j7chku2

"That's the thing that gives me the most positive outlook with Ten Hag. We went on crazy runs under Mourinho and Ole as well but then we loose one match, and we just started dropping points left and right. Under Ten Hag, we don't do that anymore",Manchester United,Yes,j7auvot,t1_j7as83h

"It‚Äôs a good thing with this red card because I think he won‚Äôt have rested much at all without it. He may not need it but it‚Äôs always good to have some rest to keep players fresh and sharper than without I think. 

Hope Bruno gets subbed out in games too and we lead comfortably by 60 min.",Manchester United,Yes,j7a9bmq,t1_j7a2jze
"he really thrives when he‚Äôs asked to be a rotational, energising piece in our midfield, rather than having to constantly shoulder the burden of our midfield.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ac211,t1_j7aacaa
I mean we've been doing that pretty constantly this season and i love it.,Manchester United,Yes,j7a7o7d,t1_j7a3gw4
Precisely the opposite of Garnacho who plays for the team.,Manchester United,Yes,j7beg6m,t1_j7bcp5k
There were a couple of attitude issues. The incident with England when breaking covid rules and I remember Ole having an issue with him staying up late on his Xbox or something.,Manchester United,Yes,j7bo91k,t1_j7bcp5k
I think Ole and Southgate knew more about Greenwood‚Äôs issues than they revealed. Withdrawing him from England seemed strange considering the reason given for withdrawal.,Manchester United,Yes,j7burt2,t1_j7bcp5k
Rather Tottenham lost or drew we can think about city when top 4 is beyond doubt.,Manchester United,Yes,j7c25n1,t1_j7c1n4f
"It‚Äôs mental how well ETH has done so quickly, he was my top choice back when the Ole era was clearly over but I never thought we‚Äôd be playing so well this soon into season 1, winning a cup and finishing top 4 would be an unreal achievement",Manchester United,Yes,j7cf1z6,t1_j7ca86t
"For sure. It‚Äôs not his fault. He‚Äôs working hard to be fit and even tried to play while not as sharp as he wants to play and believes in the team and all. 

He‚Äôs just not reliable and it‚Äôs sad when players succumb to injury issues. We do need to move on from him unfortunately. 

I don‚Äôt at all fault players who are injury prone and try anyway. Just very unfortunate.",Manchester United,Yes,j7a92od,t1_j7a4jzj

"This is an average City team (by their recent standards) whose weaknesses have been masked by the brilliance of Haaland.

Still a dangerous team who can beat anyone on their day, but also very much beatable themselves.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bsdp2,t1_j7bqoqd
They went all in on Haaland & he's made then easier to play against,Manchester United,Yes,j7bugrb,t1_j7bqoqd
r/soccer mods seem a bit too sensitive and trigger-happy which tbf seems to be pretty common on reddit,Manchester United,Yes,j7bszqq,t1_j7bs6kf
I feel like his tinkering has cost them at least 1 CL (final Vs Chelsea where he inexplicably decided not to play a holding midfielder),Manchester United,Yes,j7c89ot,t1_j7c6y5p
"They might, or they might experience a drop in form that gives other teams an opportunity. We just need to concentrate on our own games and see what happens.",Manchester United,Yes,j7cq6y6,t1_j7cofqk
"No chance they sack him this season unless he loses every single game and loses the dressing room. He's earnt the right to fuck most of these players off and rebuild. 

If he's shit *next* season it's probably time for him to walk.",Manchester United,Yes,j7awifo,t1_j7av9rc
"No matter how much goodwill a manager has, they can be sacked.

The fans and also the players will determine that. Usually if the players stop putting the hard yards in then there‚Äôs no way back. I‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs the case yet, but there‚Äôs definitely a way for any manager to be sacked especially these days.",Manchester United,Yes,j7awmot,t1_j7av9rc
"Yeah but who can they get to come in after Klopp is the bigger question, can they afford that sort of upheaval?

Not that I care but from their perspective there's no one available that can improve the results, it is likely he'll stay put and write off this season and focus on the next one.",Manchester United,Yes,j7axch8,t1_j7av9rc
"7 goals conceded because of Kounde, Araujo, Christensen (who were all injured for the CL). Wouldn't have high hopes",Manchester United,Yes,j7cz501,t1_j7cy1gc

"The more people try to meme him for him ‚Äúclaiming‚Äù it, the more it becomes his. Some of the banter is funny, but the people getting genuinely wound up over it is a bit weird. Besides, it‚Äôs obviously not new, but he also does the head point in a specific way.",Manchester United,Yes,j7as28d,t1_j7arts3
"When did he first adopt the celebration? Does it coincide with him going on an absolute tear of scoring?

In my head the first time he did it was after getting dropped for being late to a team meetings which wasn't quite at the start of his goalscoring run",Manchester United,Yes,j7atnjk,t1_j7arts3

"I don‚Äôt think Sancho has enough match fitness, but I think he‚Äôs coming on the second half.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b36zf,t1_j7b2qch
For the inevitable price he'll cost I genuinely think we could probably be able to get Kane or Vlahovic AND a young prospect to offer a different profile/backup,Manchester United,Yes,j7b98aq,t1_j7b66kv
Could also go for vlahovic if he's available. Always good to have options.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b6x95,t1_j7b66kv
"Everyone keeps saying this but I simply don't see it. Even ETH said he crossed the line.  Maybe they would reduce the 3 match ban, but it's still a red",Manchester United,Yes,j7blgks,t1_j7b6ywq
If City do the double against Arsenal things get really interesting,Manchester United,Yes,j7c4yl0,t1_j7c3el2
I'd argue we could sneak 1st in the last few days of the season if Arsenal drop more points and we keep winning. City will drop points too.,Manchester United,Yes,j7c5t27,t1_j7c3el2

No surprises. We are the biggest club in the world.,Manchester United,Yes,j7as88z,t1_j7as0yl
"He didn‚Äôt want specifically Ajax players, just winners. He knew Antony and Martinez were winners having managed them for a few years. The added benefit is that they filled two positions we needed filled.

"He like players with tenacity if we see his signing mostly it's player with desire to win, I like the sabitzer signing not watch him very much in bayern but when in leipzig he is amazing very hard working midfielder and maybe ETH realize if we go against team with high intensity it's almost useless using eriksen so he need anothee option...",Manchester United,Yes,j7c9oko,t1_j7c7j4i

Very promising that we're 2/3 way done with this. Tough away games to come of course at places like Anfield but should hopefully make for a decent run in to end the season strong,Manchester United,Yes,j7c60ya,t1_j7c5ltc
"I never felt bad ‚Äúrooting‚Äù for Man City to be honest. Whenever they play Liverpool, I always want Man City to win. They‚Äôre a fake soulless club without fans - wanting them to win doesn‚Äôt feel wrong. I just don‚Äôt care about them and neither do their own fans lol.

I hope they smash Spurs. We need to get as big of a Cushion in the top 4 as possible. 

Spurs are probably gonna win now - they bottle it when I want them to win and win when I want them to lose.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b52py,t1_j7b2efw

EL takes the life out of you with the travel and fixture congestion. Mourinho had to throw the league away to win it. Ole suffered massively due to fatigue in the final.,Manchester United,Yes,j7d6qtq,t1_j7d06y2
No chance we could beat Barca and its better if we can focus on Prem and Fa cup.,Manchester United,Yes,j7d2jlz,t1_j7d06y2
"I 100% agree. It‚Äôs possible that EL tests the limits of the squad in both PL and EL and we end up missing out in both. 

Some will argue it‚Äôs a second chance at CL football but our league position is decent. If we weren‚Äôt in both cups and weren‚Äôt playing every 3 days since forever we‚Äôd obviously all think otherwise.",Manchester United,Yes,j7d3ggs,t1_j7d06y2
"I think it's a reasonable take. 

My view is that I'll always support the club in every match they play but IF we were to get knocked out of the EL then I wouldn't dwell on it either. Yes I'd be disappointed but I'd move past it relatively quickly.",Manchester United,Yes,j7dfzcd,t1_j7d06y2
Agree. Obviously want to beat Barca just for the pride but if we're gonna win the Europa League then it's another 9 games all over Europe for a competition I haven't even thought about for months. Hopefully our league form means we don't need it for CL qualification.,Manchester United,Yes,j7dm0jg,t1_j7d06y2
First thing that came to my mind too. That should‚Äôve been a red too but I‚Äôm happy with how that turned out,Manchester United,Yes,j7aswqo,t1_j7arnvd
He was calling ETH‚Äôs head after the first 2 games. He is a dumb mf,Manchester United,Yes,j7aywmp,t1_j7ayofb
City losing points will actually lift our players much. Always go for teams above you to loss points to gain moment. This league is taken game by game. Being 3 points behind city is massive,Manchester United,Yes,j7bwncd,t1_j7bv68e
Eriksen is a temporary fix who would ideally be a rotation option himself and I strongly doubt ETH wants his replacement to be the same profile. De Jong his ideal type of midfielder and I‚Äôd be looking on some similar and realistic midfielders of Frenkie profile. Barella comes to mind first,Manchester United,Yes,j7aeyii,t1_j7aeaim
"I think we were looking at Neves, championship side not idea. But I do have a suggestion on a Casemiro understudy or rather replacement. I watched the whole Chelsea vs Fulham match, I really liked Palhinha, he looked reckless albeit very similar and high intensity with Case. He did tackles in the right places (which he seems to use as his main ball winning trick) he had positioning, pressure and good anticipation as well.

Maybe was a 1 game thing but idk...felt very instinctive",Manchester United,Yes,j7af05z,t1_j7aeaim
"I've always felt JWP would do well as Erisken's replacement. If Southampton get relegated, we should try to get him",Manchester United,Yes,j7af83n,t1_j7aeaim
Would a player like Enzo Le Fee fit?,Manchester United,Yes,j7afido,t1_j7aeaim
"There's this kid called Garner, oh never mind.",Manchester United,Yes,j7anbpg,t1_j7aeaim
"I disagree, if we beat them, they‚Äôll be less confident the next game",Manchester United,Yes,j7at3b3,t1_j7aql5z
"The Match of the Day angle from last night is probably the best one, and further illustrates that it wasn't nearly as bad as it first looks.",Manchester United,Yes,j7avgec,t1_j7audoi
"Unfortunately raising your hands to a players face or neck is always going to give them grounds to maintain their decision. Raising your hands isn‚Äôt always a red card offence, but to overturn one that was given in that scenario would be difficult. They‚Äôll also argue about precedent setting and all that crap.

Ultimately it just shines a light on how shitty some of the arbitrary rules are. They should be able to retrospectively review the ban, as clearly missing 3 games for that is nonsensical. Much like the rule that if you get a yellow you escape retrospective action is dumb too, as Fabinho was able to escape punishment for hacking down a player with his studs up last week. 

Also‚Ä¶.  VAR being able to show the ref a loop of one distant angle is proper fucking weird and incompetent. Instead of showing further context it just distorts it to show the VARs own context and agenda.",Manchester United,Yes,j7av441,t1_j7audoi
"The club will not appeal, imo. Casemiro clearly has his hands over Will Hughes' neck. If the appeal fails then Casemiro is suspended for an additional game I believe.",Manchester United,Yes,j7aurda,t1_j7audoi
"Is there any precedent for opposition players supporting a red card appeal? Will Hughes didn't look particular mad about the 'violent conduct' and they were even hugging it out a couple seconds later and some angles it looks more like casemiro is pulling him away from the main shoving match

Ultimately most of the angles are somewhat subjective. Some support the opinion that it's violent conduct and red card, others look like he is more restraining Hughes and will Hughes / casemiro are the only ones that really knows what the contact and intent was

Wonder is there any precedent or has an opposition player ever supported an appeal with a signed statement or similar that they didn't feel at the time there was any violent conduct and the red card was unjust

Maybe if Hughes sees some injustice in the red, neither him nor his club stand to gain anything from casemiro missing games, he could be a key witness here! Not that I think this will happen, I'm just curious if there is any precedent for opposition player supporting a red card appeal against a violent conduct charge",Manchester United,Yes,j7az7de,t1_j7audoi
"Short answer is yes.

Long answer is yeeeeeeeeees.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b119b,t1_j7b0hso
We would be absolutely unstoppable if we add Kane to this team,Manchester United,Yes,j7b2hb5,t1_j7b0hso
"Because there's only 2, maybe 3, others in the world like that?",Manchester United,Yes,j7bqbx0,t1_j7bq4jv

"Knowing our bad luck + their scummy luck, they will get a bullshit offiside goal because there are not enough cameras at Anfield to provide evidence for VAR even though it;s visible to naked eye from International Space Station, and we would have to work hard for an equalizer, all this while Thiago will keep rolling on the floor after each misplaced pass so they will keep getting the possession back.",Manchester United,Yes,j7anpc8,t1_j7al28g
"Not going to happen. It's at Anfield. The last we beat Liverpool by more than one goal at Anfield, Spice Girls were at their peak.",Manchester United,Yes,j7andx3,t1_j7al28g
All I care about is 3 points. They arnt a top 4 rival. Its just another game to win.,Manchester United,Yes,j7amc1y,t1_j7al28g
"It would be nice, but it's all about us. Get into the top 4 and finish 20 points ahead of them would be better for me and beat them by a goal",Manchester United,Yes,j7am0tz,t1_j7al28g
I was one of those who didn't want him but you can't judge players like Gakpo and Nunez based on their first season in the most dysfunctional team in the league. I'd prefer they flop ofc.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b146w,t1_j7az8rd
"Gakpo might come good but physically he doesn't look like he has the tools to be a top tier striker, really slow whenever I've watched him.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b3z7s,t1_j7az8rd
"Was worried when we got linked to Nunez for mega money, was even more worried when we were looking at spending a big chunk of our limited money on Gakpo.

I was ecstatic when they got snapped up by someone else. Even better that it's Liverpool.

They're both just not good enough with a football.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b99d2,t1_j7az8rd
It was always going to be a transition season regardless of whether we took a long time to build a proper setup that was serviceable or if we overdeliver as we currently are doing though.,Manchester United,Yes,j7a8jla,t1_j7a7sks

The frustrating thing is that if we hadn't had such a shitty start we'd be right up in it,Manchester United,Yes,j7auh8b,t1_j7atsvb
"Honestly, I think our midfield is too light in depth and we are a top CF short

Defensively we look great and have good depth, our starting midfielders and attackers are probably good enough when on form but martial is so unreliable, antony not yet consistent enough and we are a casimiro, Bruno or rashford injury away from being massively weakened

I think this year is too soon for this group of players but that shouldn't take away from a season of great progress on the pitch and if ETH is backed in the summer and strengthens a couple of key positions plus adds depth then we can be a real threat next year

It's clear we are moving in n the right direction",Manchester United,Yes,j7aulfi,t1_j7atsvb
"Nah, we would have to have a flawless run, that's not going to happen with us still in four competitions and still raw in a few areas. An injury to Rashford or Bruno and its over. Martial being made of glass also doesnt help.",Manchester United,Yes,j7au9el,t1_j7atsvb
If we sign a top striker in the summer we will be in title contention next season imo,Manchester United,Yes,j7avyvm,t1_j7atsvb
This season? Nope,Manchester United,Yes,j7ay2o2,t1_j7atsvb
We're gonna need Arsenal and City to drop a lot more points that we are not gonna concede. Focusing on top 4 doesn't get your heart broken but I too have a small glimmer of hope. Its not every season Chelsea and Liverpool are a shadow of themselves.,Manchester United,Yes,j7au4j8,t1_j7atsvb
We just don't score enough.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b0hzr,t1_j7atsvb
"Deffo underachieved given career path and trajectory in 2016/17, PSG ain't the place for him, had he continued at Barcelona or anywhere else, imo Balon d'or for sure",Manchester United,Yes,j7azx4q,t1_j7ay7oq
"All those amazing stats and I still think he hasn't, and perhaps will never, reached his full potential.

The most talented since Messi IMO",Manchester United,Yes,j7aztur,t1_j7ay7oq
"Probably the 3rd best player of the last 15 years and in other era could have won at least 1 or possibly multiple balon d'ors

However he decided to take the ¬£¬£ and play his prime years in french league which I think hurts his legacy a little. His resume reads like he should be in conversation as one of the greatest ever and not too many would make that argument about him

He has a skillset that should make him hugely popular, goals + assists machine, great dribbling and incredibly skillful but he isn't that well liked due to playacting / showboating etc and seemingly his inability to stay fit on his sister's birthday :)",Manchester United,Yes,j7azvhg,t1_j7ay7oq
"legacy-wise he shot himself in the foot by mpving to psg. Whether you like it or not, ligue 1 stats don't count for as much in most people's eyes with PSG farming that league like that",Manchester United,Yes,j7b02ra,t1_j7ay7oq
"On ability? Probably 3rd best this generation behind Ronaldo and Messi. Overall? I'd say 6th behind Neuer, Modric and Lewandowski also. Like you said, injuries have been an issue for a while which drops him down the pecking order.

He's played 169 games for them since joining in August 2017 (all comps) whilst Bruno (who joined us 2 1/2 years later) is close behind him on 158 games. The talent has always been there for him but injuries has left him missing the biggest occasions too many times.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b3152,t1_j7ay7oq
pretty ok for the past 5 seasons. when was the last time he hit 30 goals a season?,Manchester United,Yes,j7b0n8q,t1_j7ay7oq
He's insane but he went to play in the french league. Should have moved to the PL.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b0541,t1_j7ay7oq
"I‚Äôm fairly confident about Leeds. Shame McTominay isn‚Äôt there, weirdly he‚Äôs always good against Leeds!",Manchester United,Yes,j7c5y39,t1_j7c5adi
"this is why it's hilarious when people were saying we're in a title race AND when people laughed at us for not being in a title race  anymore. 

It's so early in the season, everything is still up in the balance",Manchester United,Yes,j7c5pvn,t1_j7c5adi
"We are dependent on arsenal going on a bit of a spell where they drop points

So far they haven't looked like they will do that however they need a big reaction after their first big setback of the season yesterday where they were heavy favourites to win and didn't perform

Their next game is massive (Brentford at the Emirates), of they don't get a bounce after Everton result and fail to win that one then it's 2 without a win going into man city game and the jitters may set in

But think realistically we are a bit too far back and squad probably isn't quite there yet with depth and the amount of games we have that we can make up such ground against a team that so far has been very consistent",Manchester United,Yes,j7c9958,t1_j7c6v1i
"If arsenal lost both games to city, we are in the race. Otherwise, we are just outsiders.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ceqne,t1_j7c6v1i
We have no clue on how to score them though.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b6mnc,t1_j7b5u4p
"Spurs will Spurs my man, nothing to worry about.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bzhwk,t1_j7bvcvy
"It will be good to see a bit more of Sabitzer I guess, made a decent cameo yesterday, and if Fergie can make Phil Neville, John O'Shea and Phil Jones look like half competent defensive midfielders then anything is possible!  

Thank goodness we got Sabitzer though, who I would assume is a bit more competent than the aforementioned names, although of course, I will reserve judgement till I've seen a bit more of him.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bdakh,t1_j7b8lpe
I get what you are saying but then whats going on in the games where he scores hat tricks for what looks like fun,Manchester United,Yes,j7cc7jm,t1_j7c5g89
"Christ, people need to stop with this Antony agenda",Manchester United,Yes,j7aflir,t1_j7af41u
"Imagine if we won the game vs Arsenal, we'd be in a serious title race rn",Manchester United,Yes,j7cm5uv,t1_j7cjw7w
I remember Real Madrid fans having similar complaints about Ruud Van Nistelrooy. They were annoyed that all he‚Äôd do is score goals.,Manchester United,Yes,j7cg4qz,t1_j7cc85q
"In fairness we were saying the same things about Ronaldo last season. From the outside, people look at stats and see he was individually successful but watching week in week out, you could see the team struggled to shoehorn Ronaldo, when forced to play to his strengths. 

City are in a similar position now with Haland and I don't think those comments are that crazy. He started off very strong but after a while, teams are able to stifle it out and City haven't been to adjust or find a different route.",Manchester United,Yes,j7chhba,t1_j7cc85q
They won‚Äôt have to worry too much. They‚Äôll bottle the CL and he‚Äôll be off to Madrid in a few years,Manchester United,Yes,j7d9oy9,t1_j7cc85q
Fucking hell. Joke of a club and a joke of a fanbase,Manchester United,Yes,j7ccx2y,t1_j7cc85q
"Don't want to agree with a city fan but he's right, we'll see how they look next year but it's clear at this point that Haaland and Pep aren't each others ideal pairing.",Manchester United,Yes,j7d6iva,t1_j7cc85q
"They paid his release clause, there was no ‚Äúunder the table‚Äù deals.",Manchester United,Yes,j7cgt1b,t1_j7cc85q
"Under the table? Thats not fair. Every transfer has addons, bonuses and agent fees.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ciaig,t1_j7cc85q
we don't have eriksen so this call will never be proven,Manchester United,Yes,j7apgf7,t1_j7aoieo
We already did under the GOAT,Manchester United,Yes,j7c53ul,t1_j7c47kn
"To be fair they are lol. Haaland is on pace to absolutey shatter the single season goalscoring record and De Bruyne is on pace to match or break the assist record (which he already shares with Henry).

City are worse defensively and not playing any better as a team, but the Haaland-De Bruyne connection specifically is still the thing of nightmares for opponents.",Manchester United,Yes,j7cyz8u,t1_j7cffh0
"I mean to start the season they really were. No clue what‚Äôs been wrong since, they have all the tools in the world",Manchester United,Yes,j7cjn2g,t1_j7cffh0
I transferred Haaland in my FPL few weeks back. Given how unlucky I am the dude is having a hard time since then,Manchester United,Yes,j7cn5y9,t1_j7cffh0
"Don‚Äôt undersell the massive Club Brugge, the second best team in the world*



*if the world consists purely of Belgium",Manchester United,Yes,j7a2w5s,t1_j7a2k2a
"Bayern, they were rusty after a long break but they are amazing and are getting warmed up.",Manchester United,Yes,j7a4taa,t1_j7a2k2a
"I still have the years between Schemichel and van der Sar way too fresh in my mind to ever want throw away a great goal keeper. Sure, distribution is all the rage these days, but Dave is a magnificent, reliable, goal keeper, and an awesome guy. That's enough for me.",Manchester United,Yes,j7c4snx,t1_j7c3tp7
"I‚Äôm a huge DDG fan, and I don‚Äôt think he should be sold, but I do think it‚Äôs time to get in a new GK. If he will accept a backup role, I hope he stays. 

My problem is the options people on here are suggesting we bring in. I‚Äôm not interested in Raya, Sanchez, or Sa ffs. Bring in a world class GK. Not an okay keeper. Not saying the aforementioned guys wouldn‚Äôt be a potential step up, but for the money, I‚Äôm interested in acquiring the next big name in the position.",Manchester United,Yes,j7c6gvp,t1_j7c3tp7
"City. 

1. Good for our top 4 chances
2. I hate Spurs and would like Kane to leave (for us ideally, or else abroad)
3. Arsenal fans are loud arrogant wankers and city fans dont really exist.",Manchester United,Yes,j7augou,t1_j7asgft
"City. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I hate them, but we need top 4. It‚Äôs a must. Europa isn‚Äôt a given, so  whatever it takes to secure champions league football next season is all that matters and a City win today helps that cause tremendously. 

Also, I hate Arsenal and their arrogant fans. This lot isn‚Äôt shutting up about anything. Arsenal winning the title will make them even more insufferable than they are now. Would love to see them start to get really nervous with City breathing down their throats.",Manchester United,Yes,j7aw00d,t1_j7asgft
Draw seems good.,Manchester United,Yes,j7asl5t,t1_j7asgft
City,Manchester United,Yes,j7aslov,t1_j7asgft
"City. Top4 is the goal. We still have a congested future list and a really thin midfield. 

Summer we fill up those holes and make a proper push.",Manchester United,Yes,j7atbmo,t1_j7asgft
"City win which helps to propel them to a victory against Arsenal. Even with a game in hand on City, I'm curious to see how going 2nd psychologically affects this Arsenal team. Becos the games will also be coming thick and fast for them with Europa R16 looming",Manchester United,Yes,j7atvao,t1_j7asgft
"Depends. If you think we‚Äôre in a title race then Spurs. If you want us to be clear in top 4 asap without worrying which position that is, City.
Healthy disdain for both clubs, a draw with a bunch of red cards.",Manchester United,Yes,j7asuum,t1_j7asgft
"If it's not obvious as a general rule I find draw is usually best

A win for spurs gives them massive confidence and something to really build momentum from, apart from very very specific scenarios I can never root for city so my rule of draw being best seems to hold true here for me at least",Manchester United,Yes,j7atwre,t1_j7asgft
City for this game and then rooting for draws in both the city arsenal games coming up,Manchester United,Yes,j7b95ol,t1_j7asgft
Last week Erik said it was 1-2 weeks,Manchester United,Yes,j7cg8ua,t1_j7ce9da
Not really that helpful given their midfield can easily be Gavi-Pedri-De Jong,Manchester United,Yes,j7clnfi,t1_j7ckgko
"He doesn't have high demand I don't think, should've sold in the summer if we were sticking with De Gea, but yeah, we should be getting Raya.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b2aos,t1_j7b1mk1
We should call him back and start him instead of being stuck with DDG,Manchester United,Yes,j7b3vb8,t1_j7b1mk1
"The game vs Arsenal at the Emirates was the game it was the most evident that DDG wasn't going to cut for us if we want to challenge for the top trophies.

The difference between him and Ramsdale was staggering, the latter being able to put his team out of pressure by picking out passes that would completely go over our entire initial press, or would allow arsenal to move up the pitch quite easily. 

Meanwhile DDG would constantly make bad decisions of the pass, put the ball out for an arsenal throw-ins, launch it long to saliba-Gabriel and allow Arsenal to just absolutely lock us in our own half and have wave after wave after wave of attacks.

DDG is a legend of the club, and that fact will never change. But like Rooney, like Rio, like Vidic, like Evra, like Ronaldo, he's just not at the level anymore and moving him on will be the best for the team",Manchester United,Yes,j7anp66,t1_j7al6iz
Giving the example of Ramsdale is laughable,Manchester United,Yes,j7alqek,t1_j7al6iz
">I think it would be best if we got a new keeper this summer

Who is available on the market that is Ederson- or Alison-tier?",Manchester United,Yes,j7allty,t1_j7al6iz
We should stop this discussion altogether. You can never convince old school reds that De Gea is a net negative for us and has been for quite some time. We're winning most games so there's no room for criticism on this sub.,Manchester United,Yes,j7ali6s,t1_j7al6iz
"Your argument is definitely legit but if your point comes from the recent post about De Gea punching the ball away then is it a fair criticism?

Sure, the one in Arsenal match is bad, but this one is a curling ball to the far post from a free kick. In my view, it‚Äôs just a routine punch and people making a post to criticize him, if it‚Äôs not on the more level of hate, I‚Äôm not sure what is.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ao0rb,t1_j7al6iz
"The way i see it, is if we signed a keeper in 2018 and they played the exact same as de gea did over those 4/5 years then everyone here would be desperate to sell him, the only reason you want to keep a player shouldn't be because they were world class 4/5 years ago and have been poor since",Manchester United,Yes,j7ar22b,t1_j7al6iz
"I don't really want to argue this because I think the criticism towards De Gea is fine. He's a shotstopper and not much more than that and obviously the team could improve by replacing him. The thing that bothers me, though, is that after United wins 8 games in a row people instantly go to the match threads to complain about every little thing that went wrong. There's a time and place for it and some people are absolutely spamming criticism of him in February when there's just no way the club can do anything about it. Like, relax for a second and be happy the team is doing well. At some point it does become hatred. One user in particular has said it is literally his mission to convince everyone that De Gea has to go. It's ridiculous. 

Another thing I want to point out is that it is absurd to say there are old school fans here who don't appreciate a modern goalkeeper. The older fans are the ones who experienced players like Schmeichel and Van der Sar do everything a modern goalkeeper should do ages ago. Do you really think people didn't appreciate them and only cared about shot stopping? The concept of a modern goalkeeper wasn't invented in 2023. The rule changes in 1992 that keepers couldn't pick up passes from teammates is what led to the necessity of goalkeepers to play with their feet. Van der Sar started doing that shit 3 decades ago. Any older fan will have witnessed two CL wins with keepers like that being a huge factor. Newer fans like you should look up Schmeichel and how he came off his line and collected crosses. That's been a criticism of De Gea since day one and older fans obviously noticed that too.",Manchester United,Yes,j7avido,t1_j7al6iz
"Lots of 'good' goal scorers in lower Leagues, the gamble is if they are the real deal or not.",Manchester United,Yes,j7aaa4j,t1_j7aa65m
Kane is likely to leave Tottenham this summer and I think we'll go all out for him.,Manchester United,Yes,j7abu0f,t1_j7aa65m
I'd definitely take him for a few mill. Anything over ¬£12M I'd be a bit put off though. But he's a great squad option and does well to create space for our other attackers.,Manchester United,Yes,j7ahd80,t1_j7aa65m
"Not sure why you're being downvoted, a  backup DM is a must in the summer. ETH obviously sees Fred in the Eriksen role and McTominay isn't good enough.",Manchester United,Yes,j7axpxd,t1_j7ax1jg
"Definitely, however I'd like to see how Sabitzer does on there. If he works out we may not have to go hunting for someone else",Manchester United,Yes,j7axyhw,t1_j7ax1jg
"We did sign Sabitzer because of Eriksen injury. 

Would love to see Sabitzer + Case combo

But true we do need a backup CDM next season in case Case got red card again",Manchester United,Yes,j7aygc0,t1_j7ax1jg
It's definitely needed but it's probably lower on the priority list compared to other positions,Manchester United,Yes,j7b1vu5,t1_j7ax1jg
"If Sabitzer proves himself then I wouldn't mind keeping him because he can play as all of CAM, CM and CDM quite well. Another option could be getting a young understudy to Casemiro. There is plenty of talented DMs in Ligue 1 so we could get one there.

I wouldn't mind promoting someone from our academy but I don't really see a DM there. Iqbal and Mainoo are midfielders that play deep, but I wouldn't call them DMs. Iqbal is a ball-carrier and seems somewhat similar to De Jong in playstyle while Mainoo has some of those Pogba attributes (some good, some not so good).",Manchester United,Yes,j7bk62z,t1_j7ax1jg
That'll be the Irish in him,Manchester United,Yes,j7avakv,t1_j7ati5s
Agent Sancho needs to get this done,Manchester United,No,j7bbtjv,t1_j7bbit3
"I think I said a few weeks ago it would be funny if Haaland did a Tevez and switched to Old Trafford to spite City and Pep. I don't believe it could actually happen, but a man can dream.",Manchester United,No,j7bgwfg,t1_j7bbit3
Link?,Manchester United,No,j7bdgic,t1_j7bbit3
FdJ will play Eriksen's role and I reckon we go him again.,Manchester United,Yes,j7cpdp3,t1_j7cghbf
"One thing I've noticed about really good managers is that they are able to spot when players start diminishing on a performance level and act first, something you could argue we have NOT done over the course of the last decade. 

You don't always have to make a 10 year investment on a player, spotting when a player comes into their 3-4 year 'prime period' is what great managers do. And in turn move them on when they stop offering that.  This isn't true with Eriksen and Cass, however in signing these players he has demonstrated he has an awareness of what we were NOT doing. Something which the general fan struggles to see. 

The football performance comes first, which is why everyone loves this guy, he knows ball, properly gets football. Understands movement or lack of, understands why we lost, the specific reasons as opposed to a general mentality statement. 

Basically what I'm saying is, ETH will sort it, he has a great eye for the levels of the game and which one we are currently under.",Manchester United,Yes,j7cny60,t1_j7cghbf
"Yeah wish we were in the timeline in which they got ronaldo and we would have a shot at getting him. But oh well, everything turned out good now, cant wish for more with how the past few years have gone.",Manchester United,Yes,j7buuxl,t1_j7bt4h9
What about Osimhen and Bellingham? It'll cost an arm and a leg but then in theory our spine will be set for 5 years or more. Rice is also on the move. Why are top strikers in such short supply nowadays?,Manchester United,Yes,j7bxj7n,t1_j7bwi1d
I would be okay if we just signed those two and Sabitzer on a permanent deal and Weghorst maybe,Manchester United,Yes,j7bzwa3,t1_j7bwi1d
What's your question?,Manchester United,Yes,j7d0qbz,t1_j7cqlj4
You most definitely could not tell he was running on low.,Manchester United,Yes,j7agmny,t1_j7agab6
">you can throw in Lindelof

If any CB is to move into that DM role, it‚Äôll likely be Martinez. He‚Äôs played there before.",Manchester United,Yes,j7agl7c,t1_j7agab6
"The eye opening stat (which Carragher among others have mentioned) is that they‚Äôve scored the same amount of goals as last season, even with Haaland getting 25+. 

It‚Äôs just that they‚Äôre all going through him and as you said, the tactic becomes give to to Haaland and if that doesn‚Äôt work they‚Äôre low on ideas. 

It feels strange to say that about a Pep team, but then again he‚Äôs never been the most endearing towards target man number 9s.",Manchester United,Yes,j7d3x7d,t1_j7d1h6l
"There‚Äôs more to Man City‚Äôs apparent demise. Too many changes. Pep is at his best when he fields as many midfielders as possible. 

It‚Äôs hard enough for a Pep team to play one striker let alone two strikers plus two wingers. Also, Ikanji and Ake are playing way too much. On talent, those should be his 4th and 5th choice central defenders.

Anyway, long may they suffer‚Ä¶",Manchester United,Yes,j7d72wj,t1_j7d1h6l
"Really? I felt its the lack of service.

They aren't finding his runs. 

He didn't even have a touch in the penalty box today iirc. 

Its the opposite of Ronaldo where we'd find him but he'd fuck up the attack.",Manchester United,Yes,j7daxl2,t1_j7d1h6l

"This sub had several wanting us to lose game at the end of Ole's tenure,Football fans are loyal to none and will turn against anyone no matter what that player/manager has achieved for them

"Feel like ETH has a clear preference for right footed RCB and left footed LCB given his use of Shaw on the left at times even when we had established CBs available for the bench so in that sense our CB options are a bit imbalanced

Of our 1st team options varane, Maguire, lindelof are all right footed so I think if 1 or Maguire (most likely) or lindelof move on we will possibly try to replace with a left footer that can provide competition / backup for licha

I have used transfermarkt to help filter for leftfooted centre backs...

Bastoni / gvardiol would be the rolls Royce options, but they are likely off limits as a backup/competition/ development option

Feel like badiashile, botman, schlotterbeck would all have been great options but it's too late for those by virtue of moving clubs this season and current clubs wouldn't sell

Maybe someone like ndicka but he has expiring contract so there will be alot of competition from Europes top clubs, or hincapie from leverkusen fit the bill of quality left footed centrebacks that with some development could be elite and we have been linked with him in the past too

"He broke his leg skiing recently so at his age there is no guarantee he comes back from an injury like that at all (he will be 37 come the summer window)

Would represent a massive risk for any club putting faith in him returning to top level after such an injury",Manchester United,Yes,j7axres,t1_j7awmlx

We have more than enough wingers,Manchester United,Yes,j7adj9w,t1_j7adfmu
So far is looking immense for Brighton but hard to know of its a purple patch or a sign of his full ability just yet. Not to discredit him he looks class,Manchester United,Yes,j7advh5,t1_j7adfmu
He‚Äôs a winger and we don‚Äôt need more wingers.,Manchester United,Yes,j7afphk,t1_j7adfmu
"Mitoma is really good, but he plays in the same position as Rashford and Garnacho. If we take any player from Brighton it should be Mac Allister.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ah6sf,t1_j7adfmu
I think part of the winning mentality is to not look behind but ahead (especially not after 20 rounds),Manchester United,Yes,j7cnj4y,t1_j7cfptk
"I want a Spurs loss today, I'd be happy with a draw. 

The title would be lovely and we should try and win every game. But trying to remain grounded then top having our closest top four rival lose today would be huge",Manchester United,Yes,j7aoopb,t1_j7ao7zk
Nah man fuck everything I want Spurs to win. Will only make City play extra good to defeat Arsenal twice later.,Manchester United,Yes,j7ar9lt,t1_j7ao7zk
"If in doubt, a draw will do.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ap3zt,t1_j7ao7zk
I root against Spurs by default because that's the most reliable way to avoid disappointment. They've been absolutely pathetic in the big games this season. And I need to see Arsenal fans meltdown it's been so long.,Manchester United,Yes,j7aohi5,t1_j7ao7zk
Tottenham. I want the last game to come down to us needing a win to take the league and have Rashford bang on a last second goal so that I can erase the City title nightmare from haunting me.,Manchester United,Yes,j7as64v,t1_j7ao7zk
I don't consider us to really be in the title race. We're gunning for 3 different cups so I want to be as secure as possible in the top 4,Manchester United,Yes,j7aqxn8,t1_j7ao7zk

"Man I'm not seeing this as a bad thing. Spurs have not been consistent enough this season to be worried about, always good to see City lose and hopefully deny them another league trophy on the trot, and maybe, just maybe, this is the timeline where we go on to win it ourselves. Pie in the sky? Maybe. But who knows.",Manchester United,Yes,j7c7h95,t1_j7c5jdw

"I watch football for the love of the club. I do have connection with the players but part of supporting a club is saying goodbye to those players who were great servants. The numbers are a tool which provides additional insight and certainly can't be discredited.

I was blessed to see likes of Keane or Ronaldo play for us, but I can't deny that they had to go by the end, and their exits makes the exits of likes of Neville and Scholes, who retired with us, much more sweeter. There were also likes of Giggs and Mason who were world class but, their actions were simply inexcusable and will forever be remembered with their crimes.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bq40q,t1_j7bmybp
I don't think we get close to 45. Probably closer to 30 tbh. Last good season was 2 seasons ago. Probably pretty high wages as well.,Manchester United,Yes,j7cvoue,t1_j7ct9gg

"Pace isn't the only thing that matters. Weghorst has been great in the build up, great as a focal point to play off of, great for set pieces, and great while pressing. It's insane you think he hasn't been performing well because he's slow. He's been very solid since he joined and hasn't had a single ""bad"" game yet.",Manchester United,Yes,j7cxkhf,t1_j7cpwh8
"We get something with him and we also lose something with him. Against Crystal Palace last match in the first 30 minutes, his energy and workrate caused 3 turnovers in dangerous areas that could have resulted in a goal if we were more clinical.

He definitely disrupted some flow in his debut match, but at the same time Martial hasn't really been available for most of the season because he is constantly injured.

I wouldn't really blame him for either of those matches. We drew against Crystal Palace because Rashford wasn't passing to anyone since he was desperate to continue his goal streak and against Arsenal, McTominay was completely invisible and AWB's bad positioning along with Bruno not tracking back for Arsenal's winner caused two goals for Arsenal.",Manchester United,Yes,j7cxtfm,t1_j7cpwh8
"Well obviously if Wout's performances in the next games aren't up to standard then ETH just won't play him, thats the best part of being a loan.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ctfzm,t1_j7cpwh8

Good luck pitching sale to any club on Martial. I have a hunch that he will stay with us.,Manchester United,Yes,j7beujs,t1_j7bejiz
You put Martial twice. Maybe add Jones? Or is he out of contract in the summer?,Manchester United,Yes,j7bnkvb,t1_j7bejiz
"The club shot themselves in the foot when they extended his contract after that final, I think last season would have gone much better if he knew he had to prove himself for a new contract.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ae0s7,t1_j7acs8f
"No it wasn't lmao. So let's brush aside all the semi finals he lost, that CL group stage elimination, him consistently picking his favourites despite them underperforming, that awful run in the league from April 2019-January 2020. How was everything going well in any way, shape or form? He got the most time, patience and money and won fuck all. I did enjoy that post lockdown football but that's it",Manchester United,Yes,j7aebkx,t1_j7acs8f

">De Gea has been mediocre/terrible for almost 5 years

Somewhat unfair to single out DDG when the whole team has been poor over this period. DDG has actually been our player of the season many times which says alot for any club if your goalkeeper is voted your best player.

...but this is not to say we shouldn't upgrade to a keep that takes better command of his technical area and is good with his feet. If that player comes along by all means let's buy him but STOP hating on DDG like he hasn't helped us in the past. He is a good shot stopper and that's has always been his best asset. This is why Fergie got him in the first place and that's what his given us all these years so cut him some slack!",Manchester United,Yes,j7d2q1n,t1_j7d0663
"Come one, how his overall game still needs to improve? 

He is always in right place, participates in build up, prssses when we need, gets assist and goals every game. Theres always something to improve but have realistic expectations. 

He will get even better once we have actual number 9 and RW becomes more dangerous so he doesnt get 3 manned every game due to lack of preassure from other forwards.",Manchester United,Yes,j7d7rfo,t1_j7d6cvi

"And he's having a better season than Klopp and, with the squad he's got versus City's (and the amount of time he has been here versus the years Pep has been there), you could argue he's having a better season than Pep.

Arteta is obviously doing well at Arsenal, probably over-performing for what they have but I do believe it'll all come crashing down the next couple of months. Conte deserves a mention as a top manager too but he's obviously underperforming with Spurs at the moment. 

Can't wait to see what ETH's team looks like in 2/3 years.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ab5j2,t1_j7aaujx

"We all agree it was a blunder from the ref but at the end of the day you dont put your hand around the neck area or grabbing someone by the collar, whatever the intention is. Those areas should be off limit for any sort contact especially during a scuffle. Visually, Casemiro just gave the ref free ammo. A player as experienced as Casemiro should know better. He couldve just hug Hughes if he wanted to restraint him. It is what it is. Another important lesson learn.",Manchester United,Yes,j7av6sj,t1_j7ato2z
"In fairness, he said ‚Äú*when you freeze the moment he‚Äôs crossing the line‚Äù* so imo there is room for him to elaborate and change his opinion on that. 

I‚Äôm thinking that he generally means ‚Äúit looks bad in the images we saw‚Äù. 

But yeah, I‚Äôm sure once the videos and angles have got back to the him and the club they‚Äôll feel slightly differently like all of us.

Last few transfers will tell you that the club is now better at keeping it quiet until final details of the deal are about to be done so no chance you get any credit links. Anything you see before we get new owners is just click bait,Manchester United,Yes,j7de68r,t1_j7dd5v6

"Yes, last season they would just give up, it was infuriating to watch.",Manchester United,Yes,j7aclwy,t1_j7acfqi
"The only thing about a comeback king mentality is that although it does show a good mentality to come back it also highlighted the Ole era inability to prepare properly for games, we spent a lot of matches starting badly and either not scoring or allowing other teams to score and then that set off a reaction. 

That team also played well every time ole was about to get the sack right up until the end. It was a sign of weak mentality I always thought as needing to have our backs to the wall to focus was never sustainable.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ae3z1,t1_j7acfqi

"Not to worry too much. They're bringing in Laimer in the summer. He almost surely will leave. 
There was an interview on Stretford Paddock with a journalist from Germany who is very certain he will leave given he will be competing with Kimmich, Goretzka, Gravenberch, Musiala, Muller and Laimer.
If he does well here he thinks there's a strong chance we will do a deal with him.",Manchester United,Yes,j7arx1e,t1_j7aitpv
If he does well and wants to stay I‚Äôd say a permanent can be arranged,Manchester United,Yes,j7ardk4,t1_j7aitpv
"Yeah I noticed that too and was surprised a bit. In fact, he's actually seemingly becoming more alert in that regard. I know he did have that big switch off against Arsenal for their opener. But, I'm willing to give him benefit of doubt in that because he was in an unfamiliar left back role. As a right back, he's improving and becoming more alert to those back post crosses and hopefully keeps getting better like you say.",Manchester United,Yes,j7av3iy,t1_j7asfw3
Sabitzer cameo looks pretty good to me. He has the tenacity to make decisive tackles which is what Casemiro is very good at.,Manchester United,Yes,j7alnt1,t1_j7akaio

Against Man City tho.,Manchester United,Yes,j7aru9p,t1_j7arjig
"Think he'd be a great backup/rotation option for Varane, with the expectation of taking over eventually. 

He's absolutely rapid, loves defending, is aggressive, and super physical. He's not silkiest around, but neither is Varane. I think he'd be a great partner for Martinez over someone like Lindelof or Maguire.

We'd just need a left-footed younger, cheaper option (or an aging backup option, since Martinez hopefully has a long time left) and we'd have 4 quality CBs with a real succession plan in order.

Could get a bit of money in (or even just getting rid of their wages) for Maguire, Lindelof, Tuanzebe, Bailly, and Phil Jones, and be left in a much better position.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b8urw,t1_j7b5mdq
"Shouldn't be that big of an issue. If I'm not mistaken, City had some sort of clause on Sancho as well but they didn't activate it because they didn't feel the need to bring him in.

That's something that has to be respected about City, they act smart and use logic instead of emotions. Not like Woodward who overpaid on Sanchez, Fred and Maguire just because City wanted them too and we needed to show off our financial strength for no reason.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bj7b3,t1_j7bagj4
"How did you leave out Dembele? 

I think there is something up with the national team physio. They skip traditional recovery if it includes surgery for alternatives with a small chance of working out and it always backfires.

"I do hate when people make comments like this. As Ten Hag says, the aim is to win every game. That is the philosophy, it should not matter about those below only that we look up. We have taken 3rd from Newcastle, gained ground on both City and Arsenal with the potential to be second in two games time. Nothing we do can change what teams below us do, and if they beat those above us then even better.",Manchester United,Yes,j7c9clp,t1_j7c25n1

"I hope he starts. Antony didn't play for weeks before he signed for united. Let's not forget he even refused to train with Ajax in order to push the move, but Ten Hag started him straight away against Arsenal",Manchester United,Yes,j7b6sp0,t1_j7b36zf
A city win over arsenal and then a draw really would be ideal,Manchester United,Yes,j7c5siv,t1_j7c4yl0

Fuck schlupp that dirty piece of shit. A body slam like that with no intent to win the ball and that throws the player off the pitch like that should be a red card offense. How is something like that even allowed is just mind boggling.,Manchester United,Yes,j7d8bkn,t1_j7cr6o1
"Liverpool are dogshite, fancy us against them even with out congested schedule",Manchester United,Yes,j7c69kw,t1_j7c60ya

Iirc wasn't he immediately brandished a yellow card? In fairness that home town against PSG was a disgusting match to watch.,Manchester United,Yes,j7augzu,t1_j7aswqo
Why is he acting like he used to play for one of our rivals for? I swear the level of hate he has towards our club is senseless.,Manchester United,Yes,j7az3ns,t1_j7aywmp
He would be excellent for now but ideally we should be targeting someone younger.,Manchester United,Yes,j7agueq,t1_j7af83n
People are only talking about Le Fee because Stephen shows on apple about him in a video.,Manchester United,Yes,j7afnzn,t1_j7afido

"I don't think that's true. An extra game is only added for frivolous appeals whereas a) we have new evidence and b) stand to gain nothing from making a frivolous appeal.

Of course I wouldn't put anything past the FA to fuck us over.",Manchester United,Yes,j7auvxc,t1_j7aurda
Imagine if he broke Alan Shearer's record as a Man United player.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b1cqj,t1_j7b119b

Na fuck em I'll chat shit about them even if they start banging in goals.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b17jk,t1_j7b146w
"No it was necessary.

Don't think we were getting Casemiro or Antony.

"Another DM as well - be it a Case or Eriksen mold, we need another DM",Manchester United,Yes,j7b0rfs,t1_j7avyvm
Where else could he have realistically gone to? It‚Äôs not like Barcelona have been this amazing team since he has left.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b0nr4,t1_j7azx4q
"He hasn‚Äôt at PSG because of injuries. His best goal scoring record is 28 goals in 30 games in 17/18 season, and this season he has 17 goals and 15 assists in 25 games.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b18xu,t1_j7b0n8q
"No other club was willing to pay that release clause. Either he stayed at Barcelona who have been on a downward spiral ever since he left, or he makes that move to PSG. Lets be honest, with Messi on the same team, he was never going to win the Ballon D‚Äôor there.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b0d31,t1_j7b0541
"Yeah they were so shit today, granted they'll be a lot more up for it on the pitch with it being their cup finals but yeah, we should be able to do them.

"Haha yep, it's as if people forget how charging through the 2nd half of the season was essentially Fergie's MO to winning all the titles.

"Weirdly I'm going for a City win, not because I'm worried about Spurs but because I'd rather eat a shit sandwich than watch Arsenal win the league. And if we are in a title race then if we're going to overtake Arsenal then we'll need to overtake City en route anyway.

But will look on the bright side of any result tbh.",Manchester United,Yes,j7atch2,t1_j7asuum
"Agree with you‚Ä¶ really depends which way you want to look at it. 

However, preference on City unfortunately. Gives us some breathing room for 4th place as well as putting pressure on Arsenal. Let see how the Gunners cope with the hounds right after them.",Manchester United,Yes,j7atf91,t1_j7asuum

"I don‚Äôt see Napoli selling Osimhen this summer. They‚Äôll have just won a scudetto, will want a tilt at Europe, he‚Äôs still young and they have him locked in for a few more years. Same with the Georgian winger who‚Äôs name I can‚Äôt spell.",Manchester United,Yes,j7by3c9,t1_j7bxj7n
"It‚Äôs the daily discussion thread not the daily question thread, its just an observation, it‚Äôs obviously been done for a reason",Manchester United,Yes,j7d0xkx,t1_j7d0qbz

Ten Hag told Carl Anka that Lindelof has played DM in training and for Benfica ‚Ä¶,Manchester United,Yes,j7ahmu3,t1_j7agl7c
Lindelof got a run at cdm vs forest while Martinez was on the pitch I believe,Manchester United,Yes,j7ahs6j,t1_j7agl7c

"So do I, but I also have a clear main XI. I have one team for the league and one for the domestic competitions, and the Europa League in the first year.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bq9uq,t1_j7b6l9t
"Think Arsenal are perfectly capable of being the architects of their own downfall, even without pressure from City",Manchester United,Yes,j7bvaj6,t1_j7bpejs
Don't want City to do a Threepeat either really.,Manchester United,Yes,j7bq66p,t1_j7bpejs
I much prefer a player that throws his toys out because he's not playing to a player that's content to sit on the bench and coast with a cool paycheck,Manchester United,Yes,j7cf9v6,t1_j7cbbjo
"Cut to the opening. Piano playing, ting ting thing",Manchester United,Yes,j7akhwe,t1_j7agp5i

"> RC of 45M euros in the summer

False, his RC scales with club revenue and can go up to 80M iirc. Given United ranks top 3 when it comes to revenue he'll likely cost that much.",Manchester United,Yes,j7anhd3,t1_j7an8xl
"Isnt ndicka right footed? I know he plays on the left, maybe he‚Äôs adequate with both feet but on my eintrakt frankfurt save imm sure he was right footed",Manchester United,Yes,j7aqio1,t1_j7aq2gv

"It's going down, we're getting Timber",Manchester United,Yes,j7an0oq,t1_j7alus1
Naah can't play with two CBs under 6 feet. Disasi I think more likely. Seen more solid links with him than Timber in the last few months,Manchester United,Yes,j7amy17,t1_j7alus1
"To be fair, either the player or the bits of wood would be an upgrade.",Manchester United,Yes,j7an1g0,t1_j7alus1
"They‚Äôre 5 points clear with Brentford next. Brentford are in good form but I think Arsenal will easily beat them at the Emirates.

I guess we just have to hope Pep remembers how to win when he goes back to the Emirates in a couple of weeks.",Manchester United,Yes,j7c8g9b,t1_j7c89ok
[deleted],Manchester United,Yes,j7adp8n,t1_j7adj9w
"Agree with your comment but with Brighton's recruitment record, I expect it to be a good indication of his ability. Who we really need to sign is their scouting department. They've rarely laid a foot wrong.",Manchester United,Yes,j7agqhb,t1_j7advh5
"The bigger the gap between us and the teams behind us, the better. We've got a crowded schedule and we're going to drop points, here and there. I still think a trophy and top four would be an incredible season, given where we started.

Also, for those who have bigger ambitions, City putting pressure on Arsenal is beneficial to us too.",Manchester United,Yes,j7arc85,t1_j7aoopb
"Bloody hell can you imagine "" RASHFOOOOOOOOOOORD "".

I might be able to hate QPR less if that happened.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ay7c1,t1_j7as64v
"Still it will be interesting to see how he acts out there once Keylor Navas is firmly embedded. 

Keylor Navas is the sort of goalkeeper Dean rates himself as highly as. With the key difference Navas is world class, and has only been benched at the world‚Äôs biggest clubs by keepers who are far better than Dean Henderson, and who would probably have been first choice over de gea if they were United keepers.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b6b8j,t1_j7b5i3s

"My point is that I don't believe we have the time to experiment anymore with him now that the league has slightly opened.

Those 'next games' you refer to that we could lose, could now be the difference between a good season and challenging.

I would not risk any more games like this now and play the players I said.",Manchester United,Yes,j7cu5ba,t1_j7ctfzm
Damn.,Manchester United,Yes,j7dh06b,t1_j7dggb0
Because they're miserable rn and I derive pleasure of their misery,Manchester United,Yes,j7bg2jg,t1_j7bfjo0

Nothing wrong with this IMO. Honestly it is lot fun",Manchester United,Yes,j7botnj,t1_j7bfjo0

"How did Cas go too far?  He had his hands on his shoulder, he wasn't throttling him like the VAR pictures were suggesting.  Eric ten Hag said in the very same press conference that he was happy his players were defending each other because you have to do that in those situations, so it sends a mixed message if you are saying Cas crossed a line, but at the same time you are ""supposed"" to defend your teammates.",Manchester United,Yes,j7auvyi,t1_j7au1bz
"Watch the Match of the Day angle from last night.  He had his hands on his shoulders, then as Hughes comes forward, the momentum from Hughes coming forward moves Casemiro's hands closer to his neck for a split second.  It's not a red card, it's not violent.  It's just an unfortunate freak angle that makes it look way worse that it was.  Next time, yes, make sure your hands are nowhere near even the shoulder, but still, never a red card imo.",Manchester United,Yes,j7awklf,t1_j7av6sj

"He's a very good defender but he struggles to move the ball forward. Very poor passing. A manager like EtH wants all of his players to be good passers which would rule him out. Think he has a career in the PL with a smaller side though.

It's a sign of a fan knowing jackshit and assuming what a player does based on very-very limited amount of information and rumours.

"It's not true you are right, extended suspension is for frivolous appeals I believe. Most likely outcome if we appeal is either it's upheld or overturned, extended seems very unlikely given some of the camera angles making it look very innocuous

HOWEVER and reason I think we will not appeal... it won't get heard immediately so if we appeal he is likely available for Leeds on Wednesday but then if the red card and 3 game ban is upheld he is out of league cup final as currently that would be his first game back

If we were guaranteed appeal would be adjudicated before the 1st Leeds game then appeal would be very reasonable as it seems is certainly not frivolous appeal and we could at least present a strong appeal with additional camera angles, but the risk of him missing league cup final for me is too big of a risk if the timeline of the appeal means it won't get adjudicated until after Leeds game",Manchester United,Yes,j7avo3o,t1_j7auvxc
The extra ban rule has been removed since 2020. I guess we will appeal just for the sake of it.,Manchester United,Yes,j7awppl,t1_j7auvxc

Highly reliable Telegraph already said they want to buy Henderson in the summer permanently and he wants to stay as well. Navas is just there to cover for now. Not really an issue,Manchester United,Yes,j7b6ij2,t1_j7b6b8j
">Keylor Navas is the sort of goalkeeper Dean rates himself as highly as. With the key difference Navas is world class, and has only been benched at the world‚Äôs biggest clubs by keepers who are far better than Dean Henderson, and who would probably have been first choice over de gea if they were United keepers.

Let's not take things too far. Dean is a good keeper and he knows that. All he wanted was a fair chance of becoming our number 1 because De Gea certainly wasn't irreplaceable (and still isn't) but he didn't really get it, so he got frustrated. However, he has been very good for Nottingham Forest this season once they got their shit together.

Navas obviously had a great career and he is still good, but he is also 36. I don't think he is as good as he used to be and if Nottingham were to buy him, I think he'd be Henderson's backup.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bipx9,t1_j7b6b8j
Yea but Navas is only there because he's injured. And Forest want to buy him in the summer so he won't be worried about Navas much. Doesn't seem like a man who enjoys competition and doesn't seem like Forest will give him any long term. Good for all parties involved,Manchester United,Yes,j7b6o6q,t1_j7b5v5a
"De gea needs to leave the club for his betterment. Unless he is okay playing second choice from now on and reducing his wages to by more than 50%, I don't see why he should stay. And any sensible player won't accept that at all.

He is obviously not good enough for our ambitions.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bv24a,t1_j7bsdm6
"I mean he has his qualities , but he doesn‚Äôt fit a team that likes to progress the ball with short passes from the back

He‚Äôs a good defender for a team that relies on their CB‚Äôs to be stoppers and who‚Äôs primary goal is to clear danger instead of looking to play it from the back.

"That‚Äôs my point. You‚Äôd be spending 70mil (starting XI level money) on a squad player.

Going off last summers budget, that means spending 1/3 of it on someone who doesn‚Äôt improve your starting XI.

You may as well spend that or a little more and get someone who is good enough for the first team rather than wasting it on him.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bnhyo,t1_j7blm0z
"Yeah but he is a world class talent. Mac Allister for 70mil would be a better value than Rice (and a better fit) but I still think it isn't a great value because I don't see him as elite midfielder. Maybe he will prove me wrong, but I believe he is ""only"" a good midfielder and for 70mil, we could do better.

If we have new owners willing to splash the cash, then Bellingham is a no-brainer. Real Madrid are the only big competition I see for him because Liverpool has fallen apart while we seem to be capable of offering an interesting project.

We also don't need that many new players to take the next step. Raya for 15-20mil would be a cheap upgrade in goal, Bellingham would fit perfectly alongside Casemiro and Bruno to create one hell of a midfield and with our good wing depth, we could get away with a striker that's good, but not necessarily world class. Even if we were to go for someone world class though, Kane shouldn't be as expensive as usual because his contract is running out next year.

Then, what else would we need? Maybe a young understudy to Casemiro, a backup RB or a backup CB instead of Maguire but some academy kids could probably fulfill those roles.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bhmoz,t1_j7bh27p

"You argument has evolved a bit here from saying a GK is often the final link in building a title winning team to using arsenals improvement from 8th to 5th (and seemingly giving ramsdale the credit for that)

He is a good go and had improved arsenal, but I'd say there gradual improvement last season and more dramatic rise this year is the result of 3 seasons of solid squad building (getting rid of the older overpaid players) and building a core of young hungry players maturing well at the same time

Yes ramsdale improved them and fits their system well, but the emergence and improvements of saliba, martinelli, saka, odegaard, Gabriel, smith Rowe, nketiah and expensive signings like partey, white, zinchenko, Jesus have all been important too.

Fwiw I think we should be looking a different goalkeeper in the summer. De gea distribution has improved alot and his shotstopping is very strong but is still wince everytime I see him punch a cross that is easier to catch and these small details can cost us, I just think using ramsdale and arsenals epic rise from 8th to 5th after signing him as an example of why is massively flawed as that improvement came with many many other important changes to the squad",Manchester United,Yes,j7axk0p,t1_j7aop56

Anyway, people tend to forget Henderson was fine being benched by de Gea in 2020-21. He got the place when de Gea went on paternity leave and did really well. Then he got covid and lost his place. That prompted his reaction. I have to say that's actually fair of him. Ole bottled that.

"This is something I don't understand. He is ambitious, he wants to keep improving, he wants to become England's number 1 and he does have the talent for him. The club simply mistreated him and he got frustrated in the end. He doesn't think of himself as better than Neuer or whatever, but Ole wasted two years of his career by having him sit on the bench instead of playing somewhere else every match and improving.

His sense of entitlement comes from Ole literally telling him he would be his number 1 keeper. Did Ole deliver? No. Did Rangnick then deliver? Also no. So, Deano told the club he wanted to go out on loan in January last year but the answer was also no.

You mention it yourself, Ten Hag asked him about a return and he refused. Why? Well, that's fucking obvious, he wants to play. If he came back, he'd play maybe like 3 games until the season if he's lucky and in the meantime, he'd be sitting on the bench wasting his career.

The truth is, Deano is a good keeper. De Gea is also a good keeper. Better in some ways compared to Deano, worse in some others. Some might argue Deano is a better fit for us though. I think Deano isn't quite good enough to be an undisputed long term number 1 for us, but that changes nothing about the fact he is too good to just sit on the bench and play once a month in less important cup games. What's more important than his quality though is his age. A good old keeper is usually fine with sitting on the bench. Same can't be said for good young keepers who want to play and keep improving. Deano is 25, he can still get a lot better than he currently is but he needs to play regularly. Someone like Navas who is 36 doesn't need to play as much.

Do I mind us selling him? Not at all, but I also understand his frustration. He was on the rise, he kept improving year after year, he had like 3 straight promotions during his loans and he was among the best Prem keepers in his first full Prem season with Sheffield United when they were chasing Top6 straight after a promotion (and stats-wise he was much better than De Gea back then). Then we called him back and let him rot on the bench for 2 years. You'd also be frustrated if you had talent and potential, but you'd be forced to sit on the bench just in case De Gea gets injured (which almost never happens).",Manchester United,Yes,j7bo6kp,t1_j7bmy5z

Number 2: Yes they were unlucky to not make top 4, I don‚Äôt think they should have got it, but for a long time they were on course to make it and stumbled at the end. 
Number 3: their two consecutive 8th place finishes came without Ramsdale.
Number 4: as well as major trophies I meant major improvements, I thought that was a given. And besides they‚Äôre most likely going to win the league meaning yes, they will have a major trophy. 

Idk what point you‚Äôre trying to argue. If de gea leaves, we will be better.",Manchester United,Yes,j7apby6,t1_j7ap1vp

"I do understand the frustration that could come with having an expectation based off a casual thoughtless promise made by a former manager. But I also expect him to be able to see that ten hag is running a meritocracy here. If it wasn‚Äôt obvious in June last year it should be obvious today. There are no sacred cows. So with this new context if he still holds a resentment over promises made by a manager 2 managers ago, and doesn‚Äôt have the actual skills to match his confidence then there‚Äôs really only just the one outcome left now. 

In fairness he‚Äôs probably in his mind done with the club and has genuinely wanted to use this last loan to demonstrate to his next club that he‚Äôs worthy of starting every week. I‚Äôll be honest, that he‚Äôs found success at low-mid table clubs is probably good for him and I hope that‚Äôs where his ambitions remain. If he cannot unseat DDG with DDG‚Äôs obvious limitations he‚Äôd likely also rot on the bench at any club where there‚Äôs a solid competition between two very solid keepers. I think he‚Äôs solid. I think he thinks he‚Äôs better than that and there‚Äôs just no evidence to support that. None of this is about stats and evidence. All of it seems to be he‚Äôs done because he thinks the club has broken promises and he‚Äôs unwilling to see it any other way. 

As a matter of fact if Donnarumma sat on United‚Äôs bench for 5 years he‚Äôd look better than both DDG and Henderson. He is obviously good. I take issue that Henderson perhaps thinks that he‚Äôs that good and therefore needs to be made promises and those promises need to be kept. He thinks ‚Äúshow me on the training pitch‚Äù is irrelevant if ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry Deano you‚Äôre my #1 I promise you‚Äù has been made. That‚Äôs absurdly naive. 

And yeah, it‚Äôs just one more stinkers of Ole‚Äôs shocking squad management. He was worse at squad management than I think Henderson is as a keeper and that‚Äôs the root cause of the resentment here unfortunately",Manchester United,Yes,j7c5nxy,t1_j7bo6kp

Oh yes, it's my first time knowing major trophies mean improvement. OMG I always thought trophy is cup, title ... Don't know ppl have the different definition as well. 

That's my point, why have to mention De Gea? I'm talking abt fucking Ramsdale.

He doesnt need to play for the club again if they so decided but just dumping then is taking the easy way out.

As Leicester always demand high sums for their players, I would consider Tielemans as a free agent in the summer given that there are suitors for McTominay,  Fred has not signed a new deal, and Donny can't catch a break + we still may have a tight budget but need a depth option. Then I recalled a point from some summer discussions about why top clubs were hesitant to move for him earlier - like Tielemans has been being overused since he was 16/17 y.o.

I checked the total minutes for club football in all competitions (fbref) - Tielemans has 32.7 k minutes in his almost 26 y.o. For comparison, Frenkie de Jong (the same age) has only 22.1k, McTominay - 12.7k, and Pogba (almost 30) - 31.3 k.

How does the Palace prick who clattered into Antony get away without any card or reprimand? Is that not a card worthy offence?

"Just a What-if thought about our summer transfer -

Since we've heard a lot of interest for Mctominay throughout this winter and last summer windows, how about we sell him and VDB and get two good midfielders - not big money or big names but just good midfielders.

If Sabitzer clicks here, then we can try to negotiate with Bayern for him for around 40M and get someone like Phalina for Casemiro backup. I absolutely love Phalina playing the perfect destroyer role ahead of the defence. Ik he is not as good as Casemiro but he is the type of midfielder which we all thought Mctominay can be. Phalina could be available for less than 50M, if negotiated right. So we will have 2 good midfielders for less than 100M + we will have Zidane and Mainoo.

Realistically we need a top CF, a gk, a RB and a Top MF but as per priority CF has to be no. 1 which will cost atleast a 100M + the midfielders market is very thin and expensive rn, our targets are Rice (Chelsea have a eye on him or maybe Arsenal), Bellingham (Real Madrid, PSG, Liverpool, City, US and maybe Chelsea too are in for him), FDJ (Barca are releasing Busqutes next season, so no chance they will be selling FDJ to us + he himself doesn't want to leave) and all these guys will be hell lot of expensive - more than 120M easily.

So I can see Mason being brought back into the fold and explicitly told to keep his head down and have no social presence and just focus on his football. 
When he does play he will be booed by everyone and rightly so until he scores and unfortunately he will be cheered.

"Wouldn't be against having three strikers either. Weghorst could be the super sub, to close out games and because he's cheap and always fit. Then have Martial as a decent back up to the main striker whenever he's fit and the main striker needs to be subbed.

"I think their players are shot mentally after being really good for a few years with not that much to show for it (one UCL, one Prem title and that's it). Still good achivements, but City always seemed just a bit better and that has to be quite draining for the players.

Their owners also did the same mistake the Glazers did - allowed the team to get old and stale because the manager was papering over the cracks and the signigns made in the meantime were short-term quick fixes at best.

Liverpool's midfield is absolutely woeful. Their attack has some goalscoring potential, but not really any creativity. Their fullbacks have regressed quite a lot too, but I think they are the victims of their midfield woes. Liverpool went from something like Wijnaldum-Fabinho-Henderson hard working in-form midfield three that allowed Robertson/Trent the freedom to attack freely into the current situation where none of their midfielders can be relied upon. Thiago is good but constantly injured, Fabinho turned to shit, Henderson turned to shit, Keita is shit (and injured most of the time).... at the end of the day, they have to rely on geriatric Milner and youngsters who aren't really perfoming. To top that, they often play Elliott despite him not being a midfielder just because they have no other options.

Liverpool fans are salivating over the prospect of Bellingham (hopefully we overtake them, we could offer a lot right now) but what they should do is take some 100mil and completely revamp their midfield three. If I were Liverpool, I'd try to get Palhinha, maybe someone from Portuguese league as CM (Ot√°vio?) and then either play Thiago, use someone from their academy or buy someone else.",Manchester United,Yes,j796iks,t1_j78xwto

For years people have been complaining that we need to grow a spine, and when we finally do everyone wants it to be a goody two shoes sort of legally clean shit. You need to have the spine to stand against and be careful of stretching the rules. Casemiro's inst a red for the same reason Schlupp doesn't get a red or Ayew.

I‚Äôd ignore the rumours and wait for more information to come out.

They need a rebuild.",Manchester United,Yes,j78nijb,t1_j78lno6
"I know what you mean, but I guess he‚Äôs also still trying to drill his system/ethics into the first XI players, particularly people like Antony.

I don‚Äôt want to burn those players out, but it is important we get our best team playing our best before we bring on the kids.",Manchester United,Yes,j769hlq,t1_j7697hh
"Makes you wonder will the Newcastle's owners do similar before the new rule kicks in? If it comes into play ?

Chelsea have some very smart lawyers in their stable and the rest of the league has to be kicking itself. Or they saw this opportunity before and decided against it due to the risk of the long term contracts on offer.

Lots of factors like injuries long term or the player just isn't living upto the potential etc too many managerial changes potentially could fuck with a players development if he is constantly in and out of a different regimes team etc.",Manchester United,Yes,j769g30,t1_j766pae
"You wouldn't do it if you had a limited budget because it demands a very high success rate on your transfers, and you're locking yourselves into big, unrecoverable losses on purchases that don't work out.

But if you back yourself to make the right calls, you do it.

And if you get it right, you're going to reap some serious rewards in the long run.

You'll be in a spot like Real, where you're not chasing teams playing catch-up needing 4 first-eleven quality signings every window, as your squad ages out - but just supplementing it with a smaller number of high quality signings.

It's mainly a question of whether those signings will be hits or misses.",Manchester United,Yes,j76714b,t1_j766pae
"How can you say you respect it though? What do you respect about it? Plenty of cool transfers yeah but what if half of them flop? What if this is a disaster. Yeah they need time but even today turned out another stinker, they have no clear play style, no defined identity, a manager on shaky ground and their results are terrible. 

Never seen a bad team get so much praise for what they might do in the future. As a United fan you should know transfers don't equal success",Manchester United,Yes,j76buag,t1_j766pae
"If Boehly loses the gamble he‚Äôs a couple hundred million poorer, but Chelsea fans stand to lose much more. It‚Äôs not even mudryk and enzo that are that bad, it‚Äôs the other spending that seems like poor moves that would make the financial risk of mudryk and enzo not working out that much greater",Manchester United,Yes,j76g83z,t1_j766pae

I think the standard of reffing is just getting worse. I think var has made refs lazy and now with this new approach of not correcting errors if it‚Äôs not ‚Äúobvious‚Äù plus the people running it still being morons makes it the worst league for refs.

"I was blown away by Sabitzer's drive to win the ball and then the way he aggressively passes it forward. Our whole profile changed. We were razor sharp in midfield with him on the pitch. For all of his genius qualities, Eriksen doesn't bring that hunting sharpness. And Sabitzer blocks off passing lines brilliantly too.

Like you, my first thought was the quality difference between him and McTominay. He could level up the team in the same way that Case and Licha have.

Pure class.",Manchester United,Yes,j7a38tg,t1_j79zlxz

"Sign a ST when? We spent over ¬£200 mil in the summer on positions that have been proven to be more important. There was no money in Jan and even if there was, a top striker wasn‚Äôt available.

Obviously the club has been mismanaged for years and I can‚Äôt wait for the Glazers to leave but since Ten Hag took over he has been backed. We can‚Äôt do everything in one summer window. The signing of a ST had to wait and it seems likely it will be Kane in the summer.",Manchester United,Yes,j794vvi,t1_j78i94u

Caicedo?,Manchester United,Yes,j78oh1j,t1_j78kidz
"The problem is it‚Äôs a specialist position. You want a DM good enough to deputise Casemiro then you are looking at spending a starting XI transfer fee on a backup. That‚Äôs even if you can convince a DM that good to be a backup.

Likely it would be someone who can play multiple positions and can just fill in there at a need.

Funnily enough that might be Sabitzer. Lindelof has also played DM in the past though I‚Äôd consider that one very unlikely.",Manchester United,Yes,j793zez,t1_j78kidz

you cannot put your hands on an opponent like that and expect to not get red carded. i love the fella but he fucked up,Manchester United,Yes,j77x2xx,t1_j77wlc1
"The issue is that he never put his hand on his throat vs grabbed his collar (scene in multiple angles ), the issue is that a ref can‚Äôt tell the difference so not doing either is ideal.",Manchester United,Yes,j789rnw,t1_j7887k4
"I get what you mean. They're not necessarily dominant in the way a team like City and Liverpool have been in recent years.

"No blame, just a sad acceptance that we need to move on from him.

Louis Saha was similar - such a good player, but injuries ruined him. Every time he'd come back and look great again, then he'd get hurt.",Manchester United,Yes,j76nqq4,t1_j76nmeu
"We absolutely can blame him for getting injured. After almost 8 years, it‚Äôs time to get rid of him.",Manchester United,Yes,j76o7o5,t1_j76nmeu
"If we let Scott and Donny go, and sign Sabitzer and Palhinha, our youngest first-team MF at the start of the next season will be Palhinha (28). We would need a younger midfielder between 22 and 27 if we look for the long-term project. Zidane and Mainoo are not there yet.",Manchester United,Yes,j7620p2,t1_j761fgo
Bayern were already trying to sell Sabitzer last summer and will be even more desperate to do so this summer with Laimer coming in on a free transfer. They paid 16m euros for him and were hoping to get that much back at best. If anyone ends up paying 40m for him they should be banned from making business decisions anywhere for the rest of their life.,Manchester United,Yes,j765z7f,t1_j761fgo
"We can get Sabitzer for less than that, I'm sure. They'll have six midfielders ahead of him next season - Musiala, Kimmich, Goretzka, Gravenberch, Wanner and Laimer. 

If he does well here, we should offer them about ‚Ç¨20m. But I do think a midfield core of Case, Fred, Sabitzer, Eriksen and another signing is pretty strong.",Manchester United,Yes,j767paq,t1_j761fgo
"VDB was obviously in Ten Hag‚Äôs plans before his injury. Plus he‚Äôs a good depth option to keep around.

Barcelona are not ‚Äúreleasing‚Äù Busquets, his contract is expiring.",Manchester United,Yes,j761jup,t1_j761fgo
"The market for top top players is always tough, every big team is looking to improve their squad, it's nothing new. Wouldn't mind if we take a punt on some youngsters. Read from shit tier source that we're monitoring Antony Booth, honestly wouldn't mind him, he looks good, wouldn't cost too much and is young, or someone like Kamada. We need to bring young blood in, our key players will start declining soon. It's not like we need a nailed on starter for every position, we are fine except CF and maybe GK. As Ten Hag said, we need smart signings as well. Wouldn't mind 1 or 2 big signings, and 1 or 2 young squad players who Ten Hag can mould into his vision, kinda like Malacia, who can get the job done if needed and have high potential for development",Manchester United,Yes,j764lc1,t1_j761fgo
"Realistically in the summer united still need to overhaul the midfield.

It's been the same for far too long we will now find out the affect of not having eriksen in the team and how we cope will be a big factor in how our summer plays out.

Casemiro Eriksen Fred I think those 3 will definitely be at the club start of next season. Fred offers the engine room and can do a job from the bench or lesser games or in a midfield 3 with the other 2.

Mctominay is done at United. He is one name that should be moved on and someone from the youth for CM takes his place. Garner springs to mind give him a run in the first team.

We still need 2 more midfielders aside with mctominay leaving. We know ten hag wanted FDJ do we even go for him when he didn't want us ?

Who else is out there? Bellingham would be the dream but will he come to united?  

Definitely need another player that's younger in the mould of Eriksen the creative spark and be the understudy to Eriksen and grow into the role and definitely need another understudy to Casemiro. Fred is a different player to Casemiro and can't even compare the 2. 

2 younger aged midfielders between 19-23 would be ideal. Who fits that category? 

A striker in the summer. I genuinely hope we aren't serious about Kane. Although new ownership I wouldn't care if we spent the money on Kane but if it's still glazere come summer? Let it be a upcoming super star. Why aren't we plucking players like Madrid have done recently?  We need to be in that south American talent pool finding these players.",Manchester United,Yes,j76a2m6,t1_j761fgo

"You underestimate fan power. Just look at the super league.

"Chelsea isn't a small club. But those clubs he mentioned are either bigger than Chelsea or much better right now and in most cases, both. So to act like this is such a puzzling question lol, it's not. Chelsea definitely isn't Madrid. They are in disarray. They are well on course to miss out on UCL football next season. They've taken a massive gamble with their finances. There are clearly better options out there in 6 months.",Manchester United,Yes,j75vop3,t1_j75u4u1
"Not saying Chelsea is a small club, but Madrid, City etc already have a much better project in place. Casemiro joining United is a bit different. He already played for Madrid, and wanted a new challenge to play in EPL. City already had Rodri, Arsenal don't do that type of signing, the only other viable option was Chelsea itself if not United, plus we had our agents Fred and Varane whispering into his ear. Enzo had the world at his feet, and right now it looks stupid decision. Of course, Chelsea may turn things around, and he may look like a hero, but seems like a bit of a weird decision right now",Manchester United,Yes,j75uiw0,t1_j75u4u1

"Because they seem to have a long term plan, they are ambitious, they don't give a fuck what other people think and the club itself has shown in the past they can achieve success like this. Just because we have been so shite at spending money doesn't mean it's a bad thing.

>what if half of them flop?

You can say that about literally every single transfer. I have the chance to sign some of the biggest talents on the market, why would I not do it? Because there's a chance they could flop?

>Yeah they need time but even today turned out another stinker

You literally just said ""yeah they need time"" and then you proceed to complain about the performance in the first game? Their best players are injured as well.",Manchester United,Yes,j76dxna,t1_j76buag

"I'll definitely be screaming for joy when one of our players score, yes. 

He's been here for 8 years. He's been the same player for 8 years. It's never going to click for him. Him scoring a few goals won't change my opinion on him being a streaky player

Also he's never scored against a Spanish team so I'm not sure why he'd suddenly score 2 against Barcelona. Since signing for us, he's played 19 games against Spanish clubs and scored 0",Manchester United,Yes,j77yogl,t1_j77xm8y
"Bruno is perennially the most slept on player cause people don‚Äôt like his ‚Äúantics‚Äù. Plus the league is just so enthralled by KDB.

His assists and hockey assists have been game changing for us over and over l. And look at the games City dropped points in against Liverpool. Or is with bad Pogba penalties. Shit on penalty jokes all you want. But reliably scoring them is a huge comfort and not that easy.

And last year people really forget Rashford carried these team and would have continued to. But then injuries bad management and all the drama of USL and the politics of COVID where he was forced to step up as PM and take on a lot of stress.

Also. Dave has been huge. I‚Äôve been rude to him for a while in the past. But sure. He isn‚Äôt a sweeper keeper. But still elite",Manchester United,Yes,j78j5oy,t1_j78in6f
Or we can get a young DM that is intedned to phase Casemiro out. It either ends with that ytoung player taking the position or a Modric situation where Casemiro just keeps playing and we sell on that younger player.,Manchester United,Yes,j799tjn,t1_j793zez
"Also Ten Hag system relies heavily on automatisms and patterns. Pep does the same thing, we see Pep bringing on world class players from the bench and think he's got a deep squad, but he really doesn't, he has like 16 real world class players, then it's a bunch of kids. His players are really versatile and can play multiple positions, I assume Ten Hag will also try to do the same thing in next 3-4 years. 15-16 really good world class players, but then that's it. People in this subreddit want 2-3 players for every position, but unfortunately it's not possible to keep a dressing room happy if you got 2 world class players for every position as they won't be getting the minutes they desire",Manchester United,Yes,j79s2dz,t1_j78rn9i
"Mate literally everyone in that brawl put their hands around every part of the upper torso, just because for a split second my hand is on your neck while your charging in trying to punch and being an aggressor isn't going to mean I have commited a card worthy offence. 

Watch the clip, Casemiro puts his hands around the collarbone edge near the shirt hem, and Hughes keeps charging in, Casemiro isn't resisting, he lets him freely move and doesn't even hold him back when Hughes turns back in to melee.

The game says that an action deemed violent conduct performed by a player is a red card, who's the rampaging violently aggressive player here? Casemiro or Hughes?

By that Standard, the Palace player who calttered into Antony should most definitely be red carded as well. Violent conduct there as well. Playing loose with technicalities is why the refereeing this country is a disgrace to the game.",Manchester United,Yes,j77y61s,t1_j77x2xx

"Not saying to not sign a young midfielder in the coming years, it's just that our current need is a top CF - Bruno, Eriksen, Casemiro, Fred, Phalina, Sabitzer is a great midfield option to have + we can rely on them for 2-3 years easily and then going big for a couple of young midfielders, since we didn't have to worry about our attack for atleast 5 years after getting someone like Osimehen since our attack will be young. Solving one problem at a time.",Manchester United,Yes,j762cbx,t1_j7620p2
"But Sabitzer if clicks like he was in his Bundesliga days, then he can be better suited for us than VDB. Phalina is a must have option, since we can't depend on Casemiro week in, week out to bail us out without experiencing fatigue. VDB is a technically gifted player but it is difficult to keep him in a role for a PL midfielder - fast, strong, energetic. He can work very well in teams like RMA, bayern, Barca but in PL it is tough. That's just my thoughts.",Manchester United,Yes,j76213n,t1_j761jup
"I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs true to be honest.

"Try looking at La Liga and Serie A attendances and tell me it doesn't affect things. England/Wales has teams in the 5th tier pulling in bigger attendances than top tier teams in Spain and Italy. There are multiple teams in the 3rd tier pulling in 20000-25000 who would have the *8th biggest* attendance in Italy and Spain's top tiers. When the difference is that stark, we don't even need to look at the tiny attendances in Italy and Spain's lower leagues. 

German is competitive for the 1st tier, and even the 2nd tier is decent. 3rd tier it starts dropping off and by the 4th tier most teams are drawing 200-300, whilst the biggest team gets 3000. In England's 4th tier, most clubs draw about 6000, whilst the biggest team gets 17000. England's 6th tier has a higher attendance than Germany's 4th. 

Maybe it's completely unrelated, but I doubt it.",Manchester United,Yes,j76ajit,t1_j764eay

"""Here‚Äôs a rundown of some of the issues that have reportedly plagued Foxconn‚Äôs factories:

‚ñ† Suicides. The company was hit by a wave of worker suicides in 2010. Other incidents have occurred since.

‚ñ† Wage and hours exploitation. In 2012, Foxconn was accused of underpaying wages and having its employees work excessive hours. In response, the company pledged to curtail the length of shifts and raise wages.

‚ñ† Serious accidents. One Foxconn worker was left brain damaged after an electric shock in 2011. An explosion in one factory killed four people and injured another 18 in the same year.

‚ñ† Underage and illegal workers. Foxconn admitted to having hired teenagers as young as 14 at one of its factories in 2012. Late last year, Apple confirmed that, at a plant where its iPhone X is made, student workers were discovered to be working overtime ‚Äî in violation of local laws.

‚ñ† Riots. More than 1,000 workers were involved in a violent disturbance at one of the company‚Äôs factories in 2012.

 Poor living standards. The New York Times reported in 2012 that as many as 20 workers could be housed in three-room staff apartments""

"It‚Äôs up to him as well. It‚Äôs clear he can‚Äôt be the number 1 striker so if that‚Äôs an issue he can leave.

You asked me how can I respect it and I gave you the answer. They took a risk, showed ambition, have the money to spend and they wouldn't be able to attract those players in the summer, so why not? This is a completely fair stance to take as well.

Extremely generic and overrated Reddit take. You only need to look at how much money Chelsea generate every season  through sales. As an example, they just bought Enzo for ¬£105m.

He still has 4 years left and terminating him will impact our ability to buy players. I read he will be paid 16 million if we terminated him and he can sue for a breach of contract and get more. Last thing we need is to be spending on lawyers and a long complex legal battle. Also, why is the FA leaving these type of disciplines to the clubs and not handling them? Man Utd is a big target because we are on the stock market and everything we do influence our stock prices. Many of our competitors don‚Äôt have this problem, I can easily see a Newcastle or Chelsea picking him up. Hell even a Benfica and they can clean his image and flip him for 100 mill. Our club will end up being clowned, like yea we did the right thing but at what cost? Also should the club not be trying to help rehabilitate the guy, seeing as his behaviour is a sign of a problem. The thing I‚Äôve noticed under ETH is that he seems to be more understanding of players, see how he treated Sancho. The Man Utd dressing room was very toxic last season, Martial having affairs, AWB having affairs, Maguire getting arrested.

"If Bruno didn't hate birds in the first few games, he'd have far higher goals in all fairness.",Manchester United,Yes,j718pjf,t1_j717w6x
I agree. I think our defenders should also start chipping in. Before Ole we could always expect at least 10 goals a season from defenders or set pieces,Manchester United,Yes,j718ght,t1_j717w6x
I think at the minute it's fairly straight forward... Either ban questions outright or allow 1 question at next presser but with ETH responding... 'I won't answer questions on that until the clubs investigation/ process is complete' so the position is clear then a ban after that,Manchester United,Yes,j715g0e,t1_j714m0v
Wouldn't it be an embargoed press conference from after the Forrest game? If so it's before the news came out,Manchester United,Yes,j718spm,t1_j714m0v
EMBARGOED Press Conference,Manchester United,Yes,j71ciu5,t1_j714m0v
"I never actually appreciated how good both of their fullbacks are

Silva has done a serious job there - their central midfield is even stronger - Reed & Palinha are just nightmare fuel to play against

Pereira & Willian have loads of creativity to feed Mitro

They‚Äôre a fantastic little side - in with a shout of European football if they keep them all fit",Manchester United,Yes,j73s90n,t1_j73rait

Had us in the first half,Manchester United,Yes,j71aooy,t1_j712te2
I think when players get injured the clubs do recoup the players wage. I could also be completely wrong on that though üòÖ but surely since the players are assets they are able to be insured some sort of way,Manchester United,Yes,j71iwp7,t1_j71i3xe
"I mean, you technically can get an insurance for anything. It would be crazy not to get an insurance against injuries. I believe the FIFA now has a mandatory insurance policy for players who play for their national team as well.",Manchester United,Yes,j71lg37,t1_j71i3xe
"The only reason why they ""backed"" Ten Hag and gave him his targets is so that the whole responsibility falls on him. 

Lisandro, Antony, Malacia flopped? Well that's on you for blowing away 200m. They were a success? Well we have all these articles coming out telling the world how much we backed you. Also btw, as a result of our backing you're getting zero money for January.",Manchester United,Yes,j71itnc,t1_j71i3xe
"Not just Arsenal game, the goal we conceded against City was also imo his fault",Manchester United,Yes,j73wuz2,t1_j73r66p
Tete has had one hell of a game tonight - he‚Äôs been up & down the pitch like a lunatic,Manchester United,Yes,j73rjs1,t1_j73r66p
Thats why he'll be never be a world class RB. Remember the Leipzig game away in 20/21? Niegelmens completely marked him as our weakest spot and he crumbled under pressure.,Manchester United,Yes,j74q7iu,t1_j73r66p

"Based off his FM stats he‚Äôs a bona fide CM, you want a player who can play between attack and defense? He‚Äôs your guy. Best role is a box to box/ ball winning CM. 

He‚Äôs got good aggression, determination, teamwork and high work rate. Fair decent at free kicks, shots from range and pens. Not the best positionally or heading but we don‚Äôt need him for that. Perfect Eriksen replacement. 

I‚Äôm going to get mocked for using FM but hey it‚Äôs more accurate that people give it credit for.",Manchester United,Yes,j71571t,t1_j713crp

Hes better than all of them bar Bruno and Case,Manchester United,Yes,j717b7n,t1_j713crp
"Very good at linking midfield and attack. Mobile, great vision, can play in multiple positions (could also cover for Bruno). I think he will link up really well with Rashford 

I'd say he is more similar to a combination of Donny/Bruno than ERiksen though",Manchester United,Yes,j718dm1,t1_j713crp

"god I would love to see the look on Liverpool fans‚Äô faces reading that we signed Bellingham instead of them

it‚Äôs almost worth the 150 million price tag just for that",Manchester United,Yes,j718ffy,t1_j717jh3
"If we win a trophy or two, finish top 4, get new owners with burning pockets, and hoping that ETH can give a hell of a convincing speech to Jude, I think we‚Äôd definitely have a chance.

City seem like they are in the latter stages of a rebuild and don‚Äôt look as dominant as previous seasons.

Madrid is Madrid but it looks like they‚Äôre not quite as good as they were last season.

I ultimately think Jude would pick a club with a better track record of recent success, but he might just be convinced by the philosophy of Ten Hag and potentially being a key player in the third coming of United",Manchester United,Yes,j7184sd,t1_j717jh3
Do we need him tho ? For more than half the budget most likely is that sensible,Manchester United,Yes,j718d4o,t1_j717jh3
"Depends on whether or not we have new owners by then and can find a way to navigate around FFP

I don't see a way we sign him under glazers as we need other positions too so 120-150m on a CM will massively limit us bringing in a top class CF, possibly a new 1st choice keeper and other squad strengthening for players that move on (replacements for Maguire / AWB??)

With new owners and if we secure CL football, I think we are an exciting proposition for big name players again",Manchester United,Yes,j717zxe,t1_j717jh3

"Bremer, locatelli, vlahovic and won‚Äôt fit into our team right now but Chiesa if rashford leaves wpuld be one of the best replacements,  obviously I would not ever want and won‚Äôt happen but there‚Äôs rumours",Manchester United,Yes,j735s2m,t1_j731jsr

Dean Henderson was having a good season too before injury. It's all but certain he's not coming back.,Manchester United,Yes,j710xor,t1_j710s49

Who's Taylor Booth ?,Manchester United,Yes,j71w9p0,t1_j71qvfm
Can bring in better players tbh but club is run shockingly so ETH has many roles at once üò≠,Manchester United,Yes,j71sr8x,t1_j71qvfm
I expect another run at FdJ. Mikel Merino could be another if he's willing to move. Highly doubt we'd go in for Bellingham.,Manchester United,Yes,j724v40,t1_j7240rd
Can't see it being someone expensive tbh. Think most of our budget will go on a striker.,Manchester United,Yes,j727y4t,t1_j7240rd
"FDJ will be a target again, he's expensive for Barca and can generate them funds for a Busquets replacement.",Manchester United,Yes,j724bnx,t1_j7240rd
"Sabitzer hasn‚Äôt even played a minute of football for us yet, so let‚Äôs avoid thinking he‚Äôll be made permanent until nearer the end of the season.",Manchester United,Yes,j737g5v,t1_j7240rd
"I've always thought Caqueret is a more defensive player, and I'd prefer someone who's got more going forward. Not sure if that's just the role he's asked to play for Lyon, but I can only go by what I see.

I'd really like us to sign Milinkovic-Savic. He's a presence in the middle and is superb going forward. Good option for set-pieces too. He'll only have 12 months left on his contract in the summer so he should be available at a non-extortionate price.",Manchester United,Yes,j72l5dm,t1_j7240rd
Bennacer would be my ideal choice after Bellingham Personally,Manchester United,Yes,j72cmpy,t1_j7240rd
"I‚Äôm crossing fingers he goes for CR7

Those two deserve each other",Manchester United,Yes,j73jrp0,t1_j73jbtf
"You think the club will cut its losses on the most prodigal footballer it has seen since 92? 

I know he's a scumbag, but its unrealistic to expect them to, eventually they will come out as a couple and it will get swept away.

I'm not saying it's how it should work, Yorke, Giggs, Best etc are all still knocking about on people's lips, and they all did despicable things too.

Shitty situation all round",Manchester United,Yes,j7171a1,t1_j716ok0
"Great, now we witch hunt for 20 yo.",Manchester United,Yes,j717urp,t1_j716ok0
"Emailed the club about taking down George Best's statue outside OT as well. Asked them to cut any and all ties to Nicky Butt and Ryan Giggs and the club, take them off the walls of the academy, at OT and erase them from our history

None of them above as well as Greenwood is befitting of the shirt or the name ""manchester united"" associated with them",Manchester United,Yes,j7193u6,t1_j716ok0

"What he did wasn't a mistake, it was the way he lived his life. He treated his girlfriend like that because he believed he was entitled to. I can accept someone genuinely learning and changing their ways. If they're willing to be educated and to understand why their thought processes were wrong and damaging, then I do believe people can become better people.

Trouble is, there's no indication that Greenwood has changed and, even if his camp start putting PR stuff out, there's no way to know it's anything more than an artifice to rehab his image.",Manchester United,Yes,j71hh1w,t1_j719r2w
"he has 100% been training while on bail. If they decide to bring him back, we will not see him before next season, after some PR exercise and probably joint-statements from the families, they will for sure wait for the dust to settle and ease him in.

Players have 1 year lay-offs due to injuries and they do not lose their abilities. Just look at Shaw.

I trust the club to do the right thing, and will be behind it whatever that may be.",Manchester United,Yes,j719sj6,t1_j718xh1
"I doubt he was just sitting on his ass for a year.
It's probably no different from getting a long term injury where massive rehab is needed.
A couple of months probably gets him back to where he was.",Manchester United,Yes,j71a0nj,t1_j718xh1
"He is a naturally gifted footballer, stood out from very early on, 2 footed, very good technique etc. His ability will still be there and as a 21year old with no injury history to speak of his fitness should come back pretty quickly. I assume he has been doing some fitness work and hasnt been sat on a couch the last year

If we were going to reintegrate him (which to be clear is not what we should do IMO) I could see him being match ready withing 4-6weeks",Manchester United,Yes,j719sd6,t1_j718xh1
He wont be back this season im pretty sure if that. He probably needs to get his head down first before touching the training ground again.,Manchester United,Yes,j7245xe,t1_j718xh1
Can you paste the contents. Not an IG user and won't let me view.,Manchester United,Yes,j71nw0l,t1_j71kkpc
Hmmmm,Manchester United,Yes,j71m915,t1_j71kkpc
"On Twitter he said:

>The last month couldn't have gone better for me.

and

>**Now it's time to look forward to the next group of games and not the past month!** We have a lot of big games starting tomorrow.

So I don't think there's anything to be read into this other than he's saying even though the last month was good, it's in the past and we move on.",Manchester United,Yes,j72so24,t1_j71kkpc
"I would imagine the players felt let down, hurt, disgusted, probably even questioned whether they could have done something to stop what happened.

He may have had charges dropped, but no one can unhear that audio. If that was someone I had considered a friend doing that, I definitely would not want them waltzing back into my life.

My view on it anyway.",Manchester United,Yes,j71sz63,t1_j71kkpc
"The thing is right thing legally doesn't always match up with the right thing morally as is the case here

In the eyes of the legal system he has no case to answer and for people that believe in that institution there are no legal grounds to get rid of him so LEGALLY we probably should be bound to reintegrate him or at least continue to give him his salary and facilities to train until his contract is up even if that is individual training away from the group

Morally though that's clearly the wrong option and the public nature of the evidence dictates that fans / sponsors / players(?) will not simply accept him resuming his role in the squad as before. however we can't terminate his deal unilaterally so the announcement yesterday that all charges have been dropped makes it more difficult for club as we are somewhat forced to make a decision, whereas before we could just park the issue and keep him under contract and away from club until the legal proceedings reached conclusion

Even the moral aspect though is grey area, for me its clear cut, he shouldn't play for us again. others thought think morally we have a duty of care to player and victim as young adults to make sure they have the support and structure around them to get past this and help rehabilitate to whatever extent we can

I feel like greenwood still has a big say in this, if he accepts he has no future and agrees to part ways on a free and move abroad (seems like best outcome?) then it's best outcome imo but I don't think club can force that if he decides he doesn't want to tear up his contract and ride out the storm in Manchester then we are in a very difficult spot

Honestly lots of factors to this one. I wouldn't wanna be deciding the next steps

I don't want him ever wearing man utd jersey again, but I think is too simplistic to say we should just terminate his contract",Manchester United,Yes,j712eg7,t1_j710zku
"Me too, and by that I mean support, rehabilitation, and easing him back into the team.",Manchester United,Yes,j712090,t1_j710zku
the right thing according to logic or morality? hehe...,Manchester United,Yes,j715s61,t1_j710zku
"Some of these people don't even care about Greenwood, they're just using the issue to push their agenda. There are people who are absolutely dedicated to normalising the treatment of women as second class citizens, or worse.

"Standard for all UK employment contracts, there‚Äôs just the issue of whether you can say he‚Äôs committed gross misconduct given he wasn‚Äôt charged (unfortunately)",Manchester United,Yes,j72p2r2,t1_j72cx5o

"If your talking about directly from United then no, it‚Äôs next to impossible",Manchester United,Yes,j7119bg,t1_j7110a3
"Hypothetical...

Would you take him back on a free if he decides he misses manchester and offered to play for free or some nominal wage?

I'm inclined to say no, he never found consistency under 3 different managers in various roles and systems and his profile seems to cause distractions and unnecessary headache for managers",Manchester United,Yes,j71ehe7,t1_j71c26d

"No matter how well he plays,Southgate seems to never pick him for some reason",Manchester United,Yes,j74j0yo,t1_j7464my
"I'm still not convinced. He has improved his abilities on the ball which is good, but he still has pretty big issues with defensive positioning. If he faces crosses, he struggles because he can't really mark players in the box which cost us against both City and Arsenal.

If Southgate was doing the call up now, then I am pretty confident he would pick Tripper (obvious), Walker (because he trusts him) and maybe White who has been doing really well for Arsenal.",Manchester United,Yes,j74tsf5,t1_j7464my
"Probably for England as Southgate prefers defensive fullbacks rather than attacking ones.   He has repeatedly opted against TAA, for example, so I could see him at least having AWB in the squad.",Manchester United,Yes,j75mfef,t1_j7464my
I can't imagine we'll see it happen. He'll likely go play in a country that still sees women as property.,Manchester United,Yes,j71cnkp,t1_j71bjag
"The leaders of our dressing room are family men, some even with daughters. I highly doubt the dressing room would vouch to have him back.",Manchester United,Yes,j719s6u,t1_j718n13
"I doubt we‚Äôre going to deal with his return this season anyway, we‚Äôll probably put him on a *training plan* i.e paid leave until at least the summer, then I think our board and Erik will sit down and decide where to go from there 

we have far too many important games the rest of the season for us to be derailed by the Greenwood circus",Manchester United,Yes,j719s3h,t1_j718n13
"I can't imagine he has any passionate defenders demanding him back... In the dressing room, at least.

Some players likely don't care that much and think he'd be an asset, but that wouldn't be enough to cause a rift with players who absolutely don't want him back.",Manchester United,Yes,j7192h2,t1_j718n13
I'm not sure the fanbase really is that divided. There have been those few weirdos posting made up stories that he's about to come back into the squad over the past year. Sadly that seems to be concentrated among fans from countries where women's safety is far lower still than in the UK. It's difficult to tell what proportion of the fans are calling for his return but I'd be surprised if it was substantial,Manchester United,Yes,j71bg2z,t1_j718n13
"He's a 21-year old English kid. Pretty sure Rashford will not be taking his side, and he wields the most influence among the British contingent in our squad so this is a non-issue.",Manchester United,Yes,j719phz,t1_j718n13
"Eh no, 97% of those accused are free - being accused does not mean you are a rapist

Ultimately that‚Äôs because we have strong principles of beyond reasonable doubt and innocent until proven guilty - these principles shouldn‚Äôt be infringed in any manner and unfortunately that makes rape very hard to prove",Manchester United,Yes,j73aprg,t1_j72wi0y

"Hopefully it'll be similar to the Ronaldo situation. Not a clear cut case so both sets of lawyers will meet, threaten to sue each other and decide that the sensible thing is to just mutually end the contract.",Manchester United,Yes,j727jq6,t1_j71o908
"Antony is far more important to our structure. He keeps width and allows the space for Bruno, Rashford and Weghorst/Martial to operate while having the mind to stop quick opposition counters.

As good as Mason was individually on the right, our right side kept drifting in and defenders could easily overload the midfield and left.",Manchester United,Yes,j71bx93,t1_j71biwk
Greenwood is on a completely different level to Antony,Manchester United,Yes,j71gxy3,t1_j71biwk
"People tend to severely overrate Greenwood honestly, he only had one really elite skill which was his finishing. Otherwise, he wasn't proficient dribbler, he was ass creatively and would never pass, his movement was bad and he was defensively bad. Antony is still adapting, but you can see his improvement in the last couple of games, I think he will be a better player than Greenwood easily.",Manchester United,Yes,j71gngp,t1_j71biwk
I wonder could Greenwoods side possibly do us legally if we where to try wait it out till the Summer without any further announcement.,Manchester United,Yes,j714bkh,t1_j71465l

It is crazy how quick the down votes are flooding in for anyone that says anything other than Greenwood is fine,Manchester United,Yes,j714eft,t1_j71465l
"I personally don‚Äôt want Greenwood to play again either. But George Best beat his wife and has a statue outside the ground, Ronaldo accused of rape yet thousands sing his name. 

Sadly there‚Äôs no morality in football, as Harry Redknapp once said ""If you go in there and start winning football matches, they would have taken Saddam Hussein in there when he was about, the fans don‚Äôt give a monkeys!

"What should the police do if the victim doesn't want to testify and new evidence was brought to light making the case not possible to prosecute?

"Agreed. I only read the articles today about the bail violations and it's mind-blowing to me. 

From what the articles say, he was violating his bail conditions by contacting the victim, which his own lawyer admitted had been happening for months. Then police arrest him in October after finding him with the victim, he's denied bail as they know he'll break the conditions again, but he gets this overturned after 2 days in a private court session and presumably continues contacting and visiting the victim up until now. And his lawyer says the police knew all this was happening. So why did they allow that to continue? Got to blame the police in part for not protecting the victim and not even upholding the conditions of bail.

5. The dressing room was very toxic last season because our interim manager couldnt stop running off his mouth in the public. Remember last few months of Jose reign? Eerily similar. ETH thankfully has shown the respect towards the club and players while maintaining high disipline.

6. Mason is a massive cunt. Theres a reason why ole and the club tried to hard to protect him in his breakthrough season, giving him ""Giggsy Treatment"" to keep media out of him.

"Everyone might want to take a break and abstain from giving their thoughts on the Greenwood situation for now.

Everyone knows their thoughts, and *nobody* will change their minds based on whatever argument the other side puts forward, because it is a discussion of principle and morals - and those are often unchanging.

I will say this: many of us heard and saw *some* evidence with our own eyes, drew our own conclusions, and already have our opinion on the matter. From there, it's not a simple case of the victim refusing to fully follow through with the process that has resulted in the charges being dropped. Apparently, ""new evidence"" been brought to the table that has been key to the proceedings - it seemingly wasn't a *lack* of confirming evidence, but presence of contradictory evidence.

So, what we're left with is this: the only facts of the matter is that someone has had the charges dropped after an extensive investigation and so, from a legal standpoint, we've got a player that's been accused of rape (+ other charges) that has *effectively* been found innocent / not guilty / not provably guilty (by way of the charges being dropped).

The only thing that stands to be seen is the club's stance on the matter and their next actions.

Off the top of my head, here are a few things to note:

 * They have to respect the decision of the prosecutor/police force/whoever else was involved from a legal standpoint and are required to uphold the contract. (The club won't win a disrepute case for someone being ""wrongly"" (as it stands) accused of something).

 * That contract provides a lot of value on an asset that either has high playing value (if he were to return) or high potential sale value (another club will surely take someone of his quality). The club could look to sell or play him.

 * Alternatively, the club could discuss with Greenwood and come to an agreement to mutually terminate the agreement - or to agree to a reduced payout if they're clear that he won't play for us again due to the club's stance on the charges.

 * However, from a social standpoint, we're *supposed* to respect the decision of the court and not ""punish"" people for accusations alone.

 * Then there are the players. Are any of them still friends with him? What do they think? Will they accept him back in the squad? And do they have a say in the matter?

 * At the bottom of the totem pole, regardless of the decision the club makes, lies the public - the fans and the watching media. Any decision will be scrutinized and there's a great deal of nuance to any decision - even if some of us don't want to see it.

I don't want to give my own perspective here because I just wanted to lay out the facts of the situation and I think most discussions will be derailed into some really, really dark corners of depravity.",Manchester United,No,j6x995p,t3_10rle43

We literally have a statue of George Best outside OT, he's hailed as a hero, his chants are regularly still sung by fans of all ages when he was complete pos that beat his wife and was an alcoholic. Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt are still labeled as United legends, and even tho Giggs wasn't charged with domestic abuse back in 2011, when stories abt him cheating with his brother's wife for 10+ years came out I've not seen this fanbase be outraged and demand his departure from the club.

"Just a thought.

Our best season, project wise, in over a decade has been riddled with off field drama overshadowing some great moments.

Great preseason, Ronaldo is missing and he walks out early on his first preseason game dominating headlines

Our best showing of Ten Hags system against Tottenham, Ronaldo walks out dominating headlines


Garnacho, our new super sub star boy comes on against Fulham in the last game before world cup. Scores a big winning goal showcasing his incredible pace... Less than 24hrs later Peirs Morgan drops the trailer for the Ronaldo interview. Again dominating headlines.

Now in just the last 24 hours we made it to a cup final, signed Sabitzer, Varane international retirement, Sancho and Martial back, Ten Hag bday... All overshadowed by that player.

3) Victim releases statement, Greenwood releases statement saying he's sorry, will donate to charity etc and go to therapy (the works).

Some clubs have in the past openly backed racists, overlooked child molestation accusations  and at the moment there are a couple of players playing for clubs who have got off rape charges on technicalities. I don't want that for my club. 


With the women's game growing and the promise from clubs that womens sport is to be taken seriously what better way for Manchester united to set the benchmark for that. 


I've heard it would cost united 10 and a half million to pay out Greenwood's contract. I think that's nothing in what it would do for the club as a whole to set this bench mark. To change the culture of football with one strike of a pen. 


Send Greenwood to a country that doesn't care of his exploits, he couldn't even behave himself while out on bail, he will be back in trouble soon enough. He doesn't deserve to wear a united Jersey. 


Let it be clear that the club isn't struggling for money because of one scumbag getting released, it's because the owners are leeches. The fan base will not overlook Greenwood's behaviour just to allow the leeches to save a few pound.

"Charges of attempted rape and assault have been dropped against Manchester United footballer Mason Greenwood.

The 21-year-old was arrested in January last year amid allegations surrounding images and videos that emerged online.

He was later charged with attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

The Crown Prosecution Service said the charges were discontinued after key witnesses withdrew their involvement.

A spokesman said: ""We have a duty to keep cases under continuous review.

""In this case a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. In these circumstances, we are under a duty to stop the case.

""We have explained our decision to all parties.

""We would always encourage any potential victims to come forward and report to police and we will prosecute wherever our legal test is met.""

Within hours of the allegations surfacing online at the beginning of 2022, the forward, who has made one appearance for England, was suspended from playing or training with the Old Trafford club.

The club has been asked by the BBC to comment.

Greater Manchester Police said it was ""only fair"" to announce Greenwood would no longer face criminal proceedings.

Ch Supt Michaela Kerr said the decision had ""not been taken lightly"".

She added: ""I would, however, like to use this opportunity to reiterate the force's commitment to investigating allegations of violence against women and girls and supporting those affected, regardless of their circumstances, throughout what can be a hard and upsetting time for them.""",Manchester United,No,j6x4moj,t3_10rle43

"I think fans are underestimating what a good PR move would be for the club. **Mason Greenwood needs to rehabilitate his name and image**. But releasing him to another club is actually stupid. First it assumes that another club would be happy with a lad accused of rape. It's also racist to think that it would be Turkey or Saudi Arabia and not some European country. Second, if you assume that another club would take him, then why not your own club?

I think the club has to be smart. **Mason is an asset that has seen his value go down through the serious allegations and the public's esteem**. It could be he isn't good enough after not training for a year, so he needs to be sold or loaned out. But the decision has to be strictly for footballing reasons. IMO, the club needs to lead a PR tour to convince fans and the public at large that he is a changed footballer. It starts with the club imposing their own sanctions for improper conduct. There needs to be the perception that he is punished in some way for his actions. The club needs to also consider loaning Mason out for footballing reasons, to get him back into the game. But then a decision has to be made if he is still as good as he was before.

">**how and why** things unfolded as they did?

Simple. Rape cases are impossible to prosecute without the victim's cooperation. Because even with video or stuff like that, the rapist can claim ""its our kink"" and since there is nobody there to contradict him, the system cant do shit.

"If he actually decides to become a better person, and actually changes. Then I believe he can have another shot. The fact of the matter is that he is a free man, and he will be living among everyone else. So if he decides with the help of the club to becoma decent man, I believe that is better then terminating the contract and him potentially continuing being a terrible human being. That said he can do the change at another club too. The most inportant is that he does not hurt anyone again.

"Regular people aren't multimillion pound assets ""owned"" by multibillion pound clubs bound by intricate, multimillion pound employment contracts devised on a case by case basis to be airtight by contract law specialists (agents). There are also overlapping rules with organizations like FIFA, FIFPro, the PL, UEFA, etc. regarding players' rights and how clubs can and can't punish them. 

That's one of the reasons why no matter how much bad behavior goes on for however long (refusing to train to try to force a move away, for example), it's generally impossible to fine players more than two weeks wages for their antics. The kid has a binding long term contract with us and we have no legal recourse against him while an investigation is ongoing, let alone now that the whole thing has been dropped. 

The internal investigation is going to decide whether he ever plays or trains for us again (hopefully he won't). Even if he's frozen out, unless he agrees to terminate his contract we'll be paying him until it expires in 2025 (since we obviously won't pick up the one year option in that case).

"I think that, generally speaking, rehabilitation and re-acceptance back into society is dependent on a number of different factors. The first is an admission of guilt without reservation, demonstrating that the person understands what they've done wrong, why it was wrong, and who was victimized by it. They may want to offer excuses or explanations but those only serve to undercut the admission of guilt (""I admit that I did this and that YOU thought I was wrong, but I feel justified in my actions""). If they can't jump that hurdle then the whole process is dead in the water. Second is restitution: what steps are being taken to compensate the victim for the harm? This can take many different forms and likely never can equal the harm done, but it shows the willingness to try to undo the harm caused. Third is doing the work to learn and reform behaviours. Again, what is required here can vary, but an apology without showing the desire to change and be better is worthless. Both the second and third points need to satisfy the victim, not society, to be actually meaningful - the lack of this is why the slaps on the wrist for racist behaviour by fans are so derided as no victim of the behaviour feels satisfied by the outcome. Lastly, the individual needs to ASK to let back in, leading with humility, rather than assuming or demanding a right to be let back in. They need to understand that being let back in is conditional and based on fulfilling the previous points, not something that is a right. This whole process needs to be transparent to the people that matter, i.e. the victims and perpetrator as well as any organizations that are associated with them.

Needless to say, our current society is terrible at accomplishing any of this and I feel that it is one of the reasons why it is so fractured. People are unwilling to accept that they've caused harm (or feel justified in causing it), are unwilling to do meaningful work to right wrongs, and the system has only two real remedies that it can enforce: jail (which requires a costly prosecution that may not be seen as ""worth it"") or a fine (which criminalizes poverty). We do it on a micro level with our friend groups all the time (when we care to keep the friendship) but have trouble translating it beyond our in-groups to strangers or society at-large.

In this case, many of the factors above are beyond our ability to know and can't have a reasonable expectation of knowing. And it is extremely unfortunate that we cannot trust institutions like Manchester United or the Premier League (really any for-profit organization that feels they can make more money by cutting corners) to do the work in the background to ensure things are done properly. We also can't trust that the decision to not proceed with charges is related to the facts of the case rather than the likelihood of getting a judgment in court (the statement leaves things vague). As such, it will be impossible for some, myself included, to cheer for an accused rapist. If I could have confidence that all the steps were followed or that the facts strongly countered the information that we know (e.g. recordings) I would be perfectly happy to give someone a second (last) chance, but we'll likely never know for sure.",Manchester United,Yes,j6xosnu,t1_j6xk0ak
"> But he is not going to be punished by the law, so what now? What is the proper response to a situation like this? I really don't know what should happen to him.

I watch football and United because I enjoy it. I will not enjoy it if I know I am watching a (as far as we know) non-repentant rapist.

I believe people should be allowed to grow and earn redemption, but Mason 100% is nowhere near the point where I'd be willing to cheer for him. He isn't redeemed because there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute him for something he obviously did.

Who are the elite young players that‚Äôve come through at City? Foden and..?,Manchester United,Yes,j6ybdwq,t1_j6y9aq2
"City buys players around 16 years old, has them spend a year or two in the academy, then loans/sells them for a profit. It's more of a money-making scheme than actually ""developing"" players. The majority of players people point to as ""academy products"" barely spent any time there at all. Sancho, Lavia, Bazunu, etc. none of these guys were developed by City's academy. They were all signed fairly late in their youth careers and didn't play much for the actual academy.

We signed Garnacho as an older academy player and even he spent more time in our academy than any of those players mentioned above did at City, not to mention he's still playing with us in the first team. Rashford, McTominay, and the kid in the news today all joined us when they were 5-7 years old. Foden's the only good example of a player being developed by their academy and becoming a regular first team player there. Rico Lewis will be another soon.

Their entire structure has largely amounted to ""it's easy to make money when you have money"". Spend a shit ton on players old enough that they're already quite developed and will likely be able to be sold for a profit in a couple of years. It's not at all about development. It's an easy way to make money, but only really possible when you have an absurd amount of money to begin with. That's why only Chelsea and City have consistently pulled it off. They just eat the losses when they happen.

Also, we've completely overhauled our academy structure in the past few years and are investing a crazy amount into in now as well. We've come really far and are back to being one of the best again. It's an impressive turnaround.",Manchester United,Yes,j6ymahs,t1_j6y9aq2

"AWB resurgence has been spectacular for the people who for some reason thought he can't kick a ball anymore, like his ability just vanished in the air.

That‚Äôs really cool! The reason I started supporting the team is Wazza. Young Rooney was built different. I always felt like he had the right balance of strength and pace. He just ran right through players and had an absolute banger of a shot.,Manchester United,Yes,j6y0rex,t1_j6xyw3h

"That audio clip had vile dialogue but it cuts off. 

He could have gone through with the act or put his pants back on and fucked off. 

We don't know for sure based on that clip alone.

I'll just say this, if it was just limited to domestic abuse and not rape, he can probably salvage his career.

There are players who were **convicted** of domestic abuse still playing.

Koman, Hernandez, Boateng were all convicted and still went on to have successful careers.

In his case, the charges are dropped. Apologizing for domestic abuse is a lot more palatable than rape.

There'll probably be some keyboard warriors saying its equally bad and it shouldn't happen etc. That's not how the real world works. 

I am not for bringing him back for the record, just saying I can see it happening if certain conditions are met.",Manchester United,Yes,j6xk2qf,t1_j6xhz89

"Balanced comment. Thankyou.

"I agree it‚Äôs enforced due to the lack of options we have available, but at the same time eth did continue to play Shaw at cb even when Maguire and Lindelof became available. 

It pretty much lines up with what Ajax fans were saying about eth enjoying experimenting players in different positions.",Manchester United,Yes,j6wdgvs,t1_j6wapzd
"Yes no other options but still better to experiment now in a game that is dead to see if lindelof can be a possible backup in that role over coming weeks given we have reasonably good CB options (at least until mcT is back and we have 4 cm options again with cas, Fred, mcT and sabitzer.

ETH said after the game of lindelofs history at benfica that he was trained and has played in that position before and can do it. It‚Äôs not a long term solution obv or someone that is ever gonna compete with Casemiro for starts, but the window is closed now, we need to make do with what we have so using lindelof as a CM, and sancho as a 10 (2 areas we are light in numbers due to eriksen / donny injuries) is good management and potentially helps build confidence in those 2 players that they can fill that position if called on",Manchester United,Yes,j6wden3,t1_j6wapzd

"The guy is forever tainted, legally innocent or not.So, let's hypothetically say the club keeps him -

What are the players going to say?

What are the fans going to say?

And probably more importantly, this is a money game after all, what will the sponsors say?

Will he be able to handle the songs other clubs' fans will sing every game he partakes in?

What would happen if he goes off the straight and narrow again in the future?

I personally think he should be let go. If he signs for another club and gets a great career, tough luck. It's not a fact that the club will miss out on trophies without him, but with him, there will always be people pointing fingers at him and the club.",Manchester United,Yes,j6x5795,t1_j6x1z93
What‚Äôs scary is that the majority of people that watch these fan channels are kids. That is quite a high percentage of people that are willing to ignore what came out publicly,Manchester United,Yes,j6x4eba,t1_j6x3vlf
I just don‚Äôt think ETH would introduce him this season - it would be unfair to all the forwards that trained and played for us constantly throughout the last few months and might break team unity. The only exception would be a massive injury crisis,Manchester United,Yes,j6xtnld,t1_j6xt92x

"I am not accepting a rapist. If Mason WAS a rapist, without any questions, we wouldn't be in this situation. You THINK he is a rapist. What you think means absolute fuck all to literally anyone other than yourself. 

Your ""I don't know"" shows how much of a coward and a hypocrite you are. I am saying ""yes, I will still support the team"". You try to criticize me without having the audacity to say no. It just helps to demonstrate my points. People like you don't even know what they want and just go where the wind blows.",Manchester United,Yes,j70vdh4,t1_j70rdu6
"If Greenwood is a rapist,  he would not get released by the police. If you know more about this case than the police and court,  pls provide those info to the court and make sure Greenwood will be kept in jail. 

What I find ironic is that you voiced out because you are against domestic abuse. But what you are exactly doing is verbally abusing a stranger who just disagree with you.",Manchester United,Yes,j70xw6x,t1_j70rdu6

"She withdrew her cooperation, by the sound of it. She can't withdraw the charges, because it was the CPS who brought them against Greenwood.

If she now refuses to testify or, worse, says she'll testify claiming it was all a joke/misunderstanding/sex game, then it's a waste of time and money to pursue it.",Manchester United,Yes,j6xbo5i,t1_j6x8ar6
"Everyone was saying at the time we can‚Äôt fire him but if there was leaked tape of say maguire being really really racist surely we‚Äôd fire him, employers fire people for stuff like that a lot.

"He's a good player no doubt. But for the amount of money paid, it's not a good signing as of yet. Literally the most expensive PL signing ever, at that price you expect a Balloon D'or winner, not some young kid who was playing in Argentina 6 months ago, even Pogba deal looks like a steal when compared to this one. Of course, if he becomes the best midfielder in the world, it's a different story, but chances of that happening are real low",Manchester United,Yes,j6wk9ti,t1_j6wk2ut

Rehabilitation for what? Can you even get rehabilitation for domestic abuse? If he went to something like that surely that would just be him basically admitting it,Manchester United,Yes,j6xrm5y,t1_j6xlr3y
"Football fans will forgive basically anything if a player scores a few goals.  There might be some disquiet early on but once he's on the pitch and the opposition are giving him shit he'll be seen one of us.

Evans, RVP and Ronaldo had rape accusations (not attempted) against them, nobody even cared.  Look at Partey at Arsenal also.",Manchester United,Yes,j6xs5xu,t1_j6xl3cm
"Ronaldo, Mendy, Partey... Our reaction will not be any different",Manchester United,Yes,j6xuwmy,t1_j6xl3cm
"We've seen it again and again that talented athletes can get away with shit like that. In Greenwood's case the photos and audio will make it harder but a good PR campaign and him being good again will make most forget.

I'm not supporting him or want him back but that's the reality of it.",Manchester United,Yes,j6zcl63,t1_j6zbvzf
"Hypothetically, if he were tp come back into the fold, Hes not coming in this season is he? Hes not played/trained properly for over a year now. Maybe later on in the season its possible, but in the next 2 months i would doubt it. 

And thats all hypothetical because i just dont see the club accepting him back, they'll pay out his contract and let him leave at the end of the season i expect.",Manchester United,Yes,j6zcq16,t1_j6zbvzf
"Admitting it would be the best thing he could do, and should have been the first thing he did. He can't rehab his image while still denying what millions saw and heard.

Unfortunately, now charges have been dropped, he has no avenue to accept responsibility and make amends.",Manchester United,Yes,j6y9syv,t1_j6y8gb4
"Well what would be better: him going out and denying he did anything wrong (despite audio and video hinting otherwise), throwing up a middle finger to everyone and saying that he was found not guilty OR him admitting that he was wrong and trying to rectify it? The second option would show growth IMO. The first option might be more legally advantageous  though",Manchester United,Yes,j6z6daz,t1_j6z23to

The ratio of rape conviction where I am from is around 3%. If you truly think that 97% of people who go to the police claiming to have been raped are just making it all up then your valuing football ability over being a decent human being‚Ä¶,Manchester United,Yes,j6yecoq,t1_j6yc50j
"Criminal burden of proof is different to civil and just because you were not convicted does not mean you did not do it.

I listened to the audio where she explicitly says no and he said he didn‚Äôt care before attacking her.

Does that meet the British justice systems burden of proof for a conviction? Maybe not here. But nothing has been produced that makes me think he did not rape her and there is nothing stopping Man Utd refusing to field him. It is within their control and they should exercise that.

The vast majority of people believe he did it. No evidence has been produced to the public to refute that. Every time he takes to the field, that will be the story.",Manchester United,Yes,j6yf7mx,t1_j6yc50j
">grow a spine and take your own decisions

Keep it in your pants mate. I don't give a shit what you think I should or shouldn't do.

">Hes not played/trained properly for over a year now

I would not be surprised if the club allowed him to train behind closed doors or he himself hiring someone to keep him fit. The worst thing a club can do it allow a player to stew in their thoughts for far too long. Working out helps keep the mind distracted from all the pressure around him over the year.


>And thats all hypothetical because i just dont see the club accepting him back, they'll pay out his contract and let him leave at the end of the season i expect.

Likewise I don't see any logic in a club letting a talented player leave on a free. Any football club would die to have someone of his talent in their squad. I see the club cashing in on him, not letting him go when he clearly has a lot of value in the market. 

I feel like if we shed aside our judgement towards him based on the evidence we have, he's a talent we have on our books. Makes no sense to let him go on something arbitrary as sentiment. At the end of the day, the club is run like a business and I think the club will act on its best interests, loan him, ship him out, let him do what he needs to do and develop, then sell him for a good fee.

2. Police arrest you under suspicion of offences

3. Within 24 hours of you being held you must be charged or a judge allows extended custody (which is rarely granted now because it's an abuse of power to do it)

4. If not charged off you go until they can arrest you and charge you at same time. If charged then with 24-72 hours your bail conditions are set.

5. Then comes the very lengthy process of evidence gathering by the CPS and your own solicitor. You can also enter an early plea deal too and the CPS will make an offer too normally depending upon evidence.

6. During this they negotiate with the courts a trial date. Courts.will step in and just set a date if they can't agree within a few days of asking. 

7. At some point a senior prosecutor will review the case and decide if they proceed or drop it.

8. If dropped you can be charged again in the future. If not dropped you're going to trial and usually around now is when the last minute plea deals are sent out.

9. Trial. This can take years to happen (his would have been November of this year, nearly two years later)


Worth noting, at no point in this do they need a victims permission to proceed. The UK CPS can choose to prosecute without needing the victim to say they want to and can instead proceed under ""public interest"". This was what they were doing here the whole time.

28 and 31 year olds in midfield when your other midfielders are also 29 and 31 is not ideal. We'll probably go for a younger midfielder to compete with Eriksen in the summer and then another one next summer to replace Fred,Manchester United,Yes,j6rgxbr,t1_j6rfqcq

"Who exactly are they going to drop to make way for Jorginho? It'd have to be either Partey, Xhaka or Odegaard.

He might give them a bit more squad depth, but it doesn't make their XI any stronger as they'd have to drop one of their best players this season to make way for him.",Manchester United,Yes,j6rjy0w,t1_j6rh70u

Their strongest midfield is still Xhaka, Partey, Odegaard.",Manchester United,Yes,j6rhstv,t1_j6rh70u
"Newcastle are nowhere near Chelsea in terms of brand recognition. Chelsea will make lot more money than Newcastle in sponsorships, shirt sales, merchandise etc in ideal world.

Boehly bought Chelsea for 2.5b and Chelsea owed Roman 1.5b in loans. Roman gave up that 1.5b on condition that Boehly is willing to invest that 1.5b back into Chelsea. that is a win win for Boehly.,Manchester United,Yes,j6rscsh,t1_j6rqg94
"Chelsea owners are bassicaly forced to invest 1.5b to club and not take any money from Cheslea for 10 years with how Ambramowich constructed his anti-glazzers clausules after taking Chelsea 1.5b debt on himself.

Also Newcastle cant ivest that much cus of FPP",Manchester United,Yes,j6rrmk6,t1_j6rqg94
"Well let‚Äôs assume the buyers of Chelsea aren‚Äôt stupid (and tbf they likely aren‚Äôt).

They must be extremely confident that Chelsea will be worth a lot more than ¬£4.5bn in the future.

And I think they might be right.

The current premier league to deal is ¬£4.5bn and is up for renewal in 2025. That figure is only going to go up, especially given Amazon are now involved. As that and other rights deals (champions league, europa league, etc) go up the value of Chelsea will follow.

Then there‚Äôs the discussion of PremFlix. Obviously it‚Äôs only a discussion but research suggest clubs would make many times on broadcasting revenue than they do now.

The European Super League is also an ever present, though I think it‚Äôs virtually impossible in the UK currently.

All told, the premier league teams are only going to get richer and therefore more valuable.

Their purchase (and ours) may seem like savvy deals in a decade.

And as for choosing Newcastle or Everton, what if the European Super League does rear it‚Äôs head in the next few years. If you are only interested in money, you are going to wish you had forked out more for Chelsea rather than sticking with lesser teams.",Manchester United,Yes,j6sy4ot,t1_j6rqg94

These are who I want ordered by preference",Manchester United,Yes,j6rjrt4,t1_j6rhoec
"He's obviously not played yet, but I can see us buying Sabitzer if the price is right, which I'm assuming will be.

And if Spurs don't get CL, I think we can genuinely persuade Kane. Osimhen may be too expensive, especially if Napoli win the league, and since we'll need a #9 I think we get Kane.",Manchester United,Yes,j6rk5sj,t1_j6rhoec
If FDJ is available it has to be him,Manchester United,Yes,j6ris5h,t1_j6rhoec

I'd like us to be in for Caicedo. Tbh Bellingham isn't the top priority for us,Manchester United,Yes,j6rif2g,t1_j6rhoec
"I really want us to go for **Kane**. I think he'd be perfect for our team, give us 3-4 years of 20+ goals per season, and give us time to find and integrate his replacement. At ¬£80m I think it's a no-brainer. At ¬£120m I think it's a non-starter.

**FDJ** is worth trying for again, but moving on quickly if it looks like it's not going to happen. **Milinkovic-Savic** could be an excellent addition for the right price. It sounds like he's looking to move on this summer.

Lastly, although I didn't think it made sense earlier in the season, getting **Skriniar** on a free could be an excellent bit of business to then have 3 top-tier CBs to rotate in the 2 positions. He may not be keen on that though if PSG are going to offer him a first XI position.

We obviously still need a GK and maybe a backup RB (Malacia equivalent would be ideal). All of the keepers we've been linked with previously would cost ¬£50m+, so I think that's going to be a difficult one to fill without swallowing a huge chunk of our budget.",Manchester United,Yes,j6rjn9y,t1_j6rhoec
"As of right now, we might have a legit shot at Bellingham as long as we can afford him. The rumor was he would go to Liverpool but look at the state of their team right now. We may be able to offer UCL football, great squad, great manager and hopefully a trophy if we beat Newcastle. Bellingham would slot in perfectly next to Casemiro so if we play our cards, our chances are significantly higher than last season.

Real Madrid is the real competitor, if they want him then he'll probably go there.",Manchester United,Yes,j6scw4k,t1_j6rhoec

"To be honest, besides the world cup, I haven't watched a lot of him and I suspect he'd have costed half of that putting the world cup aside. Nonetheless, a good signing I think but that'd a lot of money, albeit being paid in installments. I think if we add another box to box playmaker next season and world class striker and maybe another RW on top of Amad who's less of a run in behind the by line type of player we are good.
The bad news is that with Chelseas model, they can still afford to spend another 200 to 300 mil in the summer with outgoings so expect them to pretty much be in for all the marquee players including Kane.",Manchester United,Yes,j6rj4s3,t1_j6reuez

"Spurs haven't improved, their downfall this season has been defence. Porro doesn't defensively help them, so they still have to play games with 2 of Sanchez, Dier, Davies and Lenglet in the XI. Talking about CBs that would be behind Maguire for us.",Manchester United,Yes,j6spg0f,t1_j6sjod9
They've spent ‚Ç¨600m and still don't have someone who's going to put the ball in the net,Manchester United,Yes,j6ssobs,t1_j6snl23
"The big players there for me are Mudryk and Felix - and Felix is only on loan.

Mudryk, on the other hand, I think is an outstanding footballer. He's not just a pace merchant, either - he's got incredibly quick feet, excellent passing and dribbling, and he's creative - he's got a good footballing brain. As long as he works hard and is hungry, they've got an amazing player on their hands.

The other high-profile players I'm not too worried about.

Enzo's a great player, but he's not at the level of a truly world-ruling midfielder like an elite, peak Modric, Xavi, Zidane, Keane, Scholes, or Casemiro. They're obviously different players, but pick a midfield role and he's nowhere near that level.

Badiashile is decent value at his price and I would assume people will eventually think they've got a great deal there, but it's offset by spending about 60% more than they needed to on Fofana.

They've got another Fofana up front as a gamble, which may look like a good deal in the future, but he's not an elite level striker now - so we don't have that worry.

Chukwuemeka is a good player, but what's the plan? Rotation and sub minutes forever? Weird one for him, because he's easily capable right now at his age to be playing for a good PL team.

Madueke? Very exciting, technical player with a lot of creativity. But he's injured most of the time, and when he isn't... where is he playing? On Felix's shoulders? They've got Mount, Ziyech, Pulisic, Havertz, Sterling, and probably more players that can play through the middle or on the right.

In short, they look a bit messy in terms of squad composition, but has some very good footballers in it when everyone is fit. Young defence with Chilwell, James, and two young CBs (Badiashile and Fofana), a strong midfield core (Enzo, Kovacic), and plenty of options up front. If Nkunku is supposed to be their striker, so be it - but I'd imagine they're missing a proper striker and that's basically it.

When looking at their squad as a whole, it looks even more messy because of all the poor players they've brought in - like spending 30m+ on Koulibaly - and the mediocre players that they're probably not intending to rely on long-term - like Mount, Gallagher, and RLC. At least they're moving on and not feeling like they're stuck with them, though. That's what we've struggled with.

Of the big-money buys, only Mudryk I think is truly one of the players that people will be insanely jealous of. Maybe some of the cheaper buys will come good and look like genius transfers in the coming years. But right now, their biggest scary players are Felix and Mudryk.",Manchester United,Yes,j6swen8,t1_j6snl23

"It doesn't matter mate. Nobody is going to watch Superleague to see Nantes vs Real Madrid. The whole point of Superleague is to have big matches constantly. That's not possible without English and German teams joining. Also, in Ligue 1, PSG right now are in bed with UEFA and they hate Real Madrid and Barcelona, in the end it's gonna be Madrid, Barca, Juve and Milan clubs and Madrid and Barca will win it every year, it's not gonna be interesting at all",Manchester United,Yes,j6rk0q6,t1_j6rgg94
I get what you're saying but the Germans and English won't get on board. I don't think the Super League is dead but things are definitely heading to a confrontation.,Manchester United,Yes,j6rguzx,t1_j6rgg94
"Agreed. 
Chelsea didn't even need to spend all that, they have a great academy with genuinely good players coming through all the time.

"His full two seasons were good.

I think he was ok and there were many games which were entertaining. You could also see his strengths regarding counter attacking football.

But ultimately he wasn‚Äôt good enough to be at Utd. Unless you are a very experienced and respected manager, you need to be the head coach as well and on the training pitch (with the requisite ability).

He also left too many issues unresolved. Some of that wasn‚Äôt his fault (elements of recruitment) but others were (false promises to players - see Lingard, Bailly and Henderson). It all came to head in his final 6 months and couple that with the addition of Ronaldo which screwed the dressing room and tactics, it was a perfect storm for a catastrophe.

The PE teacher tag is disrespectful though.",Manchester United,Yes,j6swi9c,t1_j6rshbb
"I would argue the opposite about deadwood with Ole. He gave new contracts to players who should never have received them e.g Jones and Mata.

 He also ran the contract down on players who were clearly either not invested at United or would go on to leave on a free transfer such as pogba and lingard.

"If we do sell Donny and Scott while keeping Sabitzer, then really the only additional midfielder we'd need would be a DM to be Casemiro's backup and understudy.

"I think that Arnold and Murtaugh deserve praise for their work because they seem to be operating in conjunction with the manager (as a team) rather than against the mamager which we have seen previously. 

I don't believe that ""ETH's work is buying them a lot of good faith"" because that good work is dependent on the recruitment department providing the types of players that ten Hag requires. While we may have paid a bit much for someone like Antony, it is clear that the manager has identified necessary player roles and that Murtaugh is able to work on bringing that type of player in - hence why Sabitzer can be brought in quickly rather than getting into a pissing contest over Enzo Fernandez (or why we got Weghorst in rather than chasing the flavour of the World Cup striker). The two departments (coaching and recruitment) are operating together as they should be and the success of one informs the other - just as good recruitment makes coaching easier, good coaching makes recruitment easier.

Contrast this with the Woodward era and we only need to go back about 18 months to see how this can go terribly wrong. Before we signed Ronaldo it was clear that we needed a midfielder and it was widely reported that Ole had asked for one to close the window. Instead he got a forward that didn't fit his plans and it completely fucked the season and cost Ole his job.

Is this the minimum standard that we should expect? Absolutely. Has our club met this standard in the recent past? Nope. Is Director of Football a high criticism, low praise role? Yep. So I'm going to praise good behaviour here rather than playing hard to please.",Manchester United,Yes,j6sxb5s,t1_j6sos53
"Smart deals and cheap signings will always exist as other leagues simply can't compete with the PL. PL clubs will just step in and hijack deals.

Players will always have contracts running out where a club is forced to sell or risk losing them on a free.

Expensive signings are only going to be the norm if you have poor scouting and are buying players who are only a year or two into their new contract and have started to make a name for themselves.

2) calm down, eventually FFP will catch up to Chelsea. This isn't some new epoch, it could be an American idiot who is clueless. Remeber the ""we can do things in the transfer market other teams can only dream off"" before continuing a decade of embarrassment. 

3) all this means is money helps in football which has always been the case. Teams like United in the 90s far outspent our rivals and regularly got beat to tournaments, only won one Champions League as well. PSG and City have had absurd amounts of cash compared to rivals for years now and still can't win the Champions league and Chelsea, which people are yet to realise, have achieved fuck all.",Manchester United,Yes,j6rxbw4,t1_j6rtlmx
"If anything the Glazers have proven that spending big doesn‚Äôt necessarily bring success. What matters most is that there‚Äôs a football vision at the club and that players fit a certain criteria. You can always recruit the right players for cheap so long as you have competent people at the club. 

I‚Äôm still unconvinced about Murtough and Arnold but it‚Äôs undeniable that they‚Äôve shown ambition with Ten Hag. On one hand they‚Äôve definitely overspent on certain players, but more recently they‚Äôve managed to get Sabitzer on loan which strikes me as uncharacteristically competent. Moving forward I‚Äôm hopeful that we will continue to make smart moves like that.

www.bbc.com/sport/football/64231986.amp,Manchester United,Yes,j6re61y,t1_j6rduue
", let‚Äôs actually look at your argument, you‚Äôre speaking like replacing a player on 500k who didn‚Äôt fit the system with a loan who does fit the system for considerably less is bad business?

Again, we replaced a key injured member of the squad with arguably an upgrade for next to nothing.

The crux of your argument seems to be that we should be spending loads of money and that I should be mad that we‚Äôre not because somehow in your baboon brain, this means I side with the glazers?

Let me be clear I couldn‚Äôt give a flying fuck how much money we spend, the amount of almost irrelevant, the idea is getting the right players in. We‚Äôve spent loads of money in the past and where has it got us? Fucking no where. Meanwhile we‚Äôve watched our biggest rivals not spend as much but spend well and win everything.

So what you wanted, is for the club to go out and spend a load of money this January? On who? We need a striker, a good one, at the moment the only two out there really are Kane and Osimhen. You go and ask for them in January and see what you get told? Anyone else? And don‚Äôt say jonathan fucking David because let me tell you, id rather have Kane or Osihmen and if we spend on David now we aren‚Äôt getting either.

We‚Äôre we going to get a midfielder if Eriksen wasn‚Äôt injured? No probably not but he is and we did, and we got one arguably just as good, I really don‚Äôt understand why you are against this.

Finally just on the concept of spending in January in general, and why we didn‚Äôt get any permanent deals, you do realise the club is being sold right? Probably in a few months time, why on earth would we spend a fuck load of money on players? Firstly the glazers just wouldn‚Äôt but secondly we‚Äôre going to have a new structure, new money etc for the summer, we literally start fresh. The fact these are loans are good because if they‚Äôre shit we can assess in summer and actually get who need. Or would you prefer we spent 120 mil on enzo and gave him a 10 year contract on 300k a week?

">	The two departments (coaching and recruitment) are operating together as they should be and the success of one informs the other - just as good recruitment makes coaching easier, good coaching makes recruitment easier.

I feel like you‚Äôre applying a narrative there that we don‚Äôt really know is accurate at this point. At best it‚Äôs speculation as to what is going on behind the scenes. (As is anything I say)

ETH has made quiet a bit of noise, relatively speaking, in both January and the Summer to suggest we need to be doing more regards squad overhaul (in and out). He‚Äôs applying pressure externally imo which isn‚Äôt an indication they all see eye to eye.

Ultimately we don‚Äôt know yet, maybe never will, how joined up the thinking is, how collaborative it is.

Better than before, not good enough is my take so far without forensically analysing every single publicly handled issue so far.

"I don't think English clubs care about that.

"I'm not applying a narrative, I'm looking at the things we know have happened and drawing conclusions from them about the operations of our recruitment. When we sign players now, they fit what the manager wants. Sure, we're shopping in the bargain bin due to finances but no player has come in such that you wonder how the manager will use that player. The players that come in are getting game time and not sitting on the bench because they don't fit. And that is a sign that the manager and recruitment department are on the same page. In the past this has not been true (DvB anyone?).

Speaking of the press conferences, I see ten Hag as just being honest. From what I've seen, I wouldn't say that he has been applying pressure to the recruitment department, just calling it as he sees it. And, to the extent that finances will allow, he has gotten the players that he's asked for. Also, have you read any reports that United's upper management is displeased about ten Hag's comments about transfers? I sure haven't, which indicates that he and the club are on the same page. Usually when a manager goes out and talks about transfers like ten Hag does you get some blowback from the club leaders who are trying to protect their own rep. United hasn't so I take that as a good sign.

The only way to be further along in this process is to go back in time and make the return of Ronaldo never happen. Then we could conceivably have added quality midfielders a year sooner and entrenched ourselves in the top 3 spots.

If anything, you are applying a narrative that before ten Hag everything was shit, nothing was worth saving, and the whole thing needed to be burnt to the ground. The irony is that ten Hag is proving that to be wrong by helping players to put last season behind them and regain confidence. Between ten Hag and the recruitment team they have made smart decisions and removed a cancer from the locker room.

"We're all speculating. I just choose to do so based on things that are not themselves second-hand speculations. There's no point trying to draw conclusions on ""paper talk"" given that we have no way of verifying any of it. Therefore I try to look at what is happening on the field and work backwards from there.

Again, you act like the club was full of useless players when ten Hag arrived. That is a narrative that set in through last season despite those players showing quality in the previous two seasons. Sure, there was deserved questions about whether those players could put 21/22 behind them but the narrative that everyone was useless is way too far. Players like Wan-Bissaka are proving critics wrong right now because ten Hag has put them in positions to succeed rather than just writing them off. If ten Hag took the same mentality of people like you we would have had to clear out 25 players and replace them with 25 new ones. But thank god he sees the players' qualities and puts them to use.

I'll repeat myself: the only way to be further along than we are right now is if we go back in time and make Ronaldo's return not happen and sign someone like Casemiro instead. The fact that we're ""re-building"" rather than ""transitioning from safe top 4 finisher to title challenger"" is all down to the absolute stupidity of that transfer that not only ruined play on the field but also fucked the dressing room. Change that one thing and the middle of last season should have looked like what it is right now. And none of that can be laid at the feet of Arnold, Murtaugh, or ten Hag. Signing Ronaldo was either before their time or came from above their heads (and in ten Hag's case is the reason he's even here). I don't know what exactly you expect them to do that they haven't done already - and it is to their credit that we made good signings, got rid of Ronaldo, and are in a good position on the field.

With regards to the money, have you looked at United's financial position? Do you understand why we're in the position that we're in? If you did you'd understand that it is a product of shitty decision making over the last 10 years, most of which was at the hands of a different CEO with no Director of Football. We've compounded bad transfers with mega-contracts that make it hard to sell players on and that affects so much of what we're able to do in terms of both incomings and outgoings. So Arnold, Murtaugh, and ten Hag have a question: do you accept this reality and do your best within it or do you choose to whine about it and throw your toys out of the pram? They have clearly chosen the former and are doing well, in my opinion, within those circumstances.",Manchester United,Yes,j6tctj9,t1_j6t5z6v

Yes. Do you understand that we could still be managing it differently since the summer. 10 years of mismanagement was not going to be wiped away in one summer, however, that does not mean we couldn‚Äôt have done better with where we were this summer. 

Anyway, just curious to peoples opinions for seemingly buying the Murtaugh/Arnold puff piece in the papers the other day and off the back of a couple loans. 

Personally I‚Äôm not yet convinced they shouldn‚Äôt be doing better.",Manchester United,Yes,j6tgyf0,t1_j6tctj9
"Ok, let's go through this slowly:

You have made a number of speculations based on hearsay: opinions made in the media about what may or may not be going on behind the scenes. ""We know that there are players that do not fit ten Hag's playstyle"" is a fantastic example as ten Hag has not said anything like that publicly and all we have to go on to evaluate that statement is what happens on the field and who gets played. As an example, we knew that Ronaldo wasn't rated by ten Hag because he wasn't playing when he was available to do so. On the other hand, I am confining my commentary to factual occurences and drawing conclusions from them. Case in point, if all the players that are signed get played, then we can assume that the manager and recruitment team are on the same page. That's not a leap based on supposition - just looking at what has happened.

Your entire argument here is based on an assumption that most of the players at the club were or are deadwood that needs to be replaced. You've implied this numerous times. Really, you'd be more honest if you'd just say it out loud rather than just implying it though. 

So, you're clearly upset that they aren't replacing the useless players fast enough. If you start from a position that everyone sucks then your impatience makes sense. But you've eliminated the possibility that many of the players don't actually need replacement. And I would say, based on who gets played and how they have played, that the manager does not agree with you.

Lastly, just limiting your analysis of the financial situation to this last summer is naive. Manchester United should be able to go through a spend like we did in summer 2022 every once in a while when it is necessary. Sometimes you have to pay up to get the players that you want and that's what we did last summer. The reality is that we needed players in key positions and we went out and got them. But that in and of itself is not why we're in this position. The fact that the last 10 years were so badly managed is why a big spend in one summer is crippling and not just a blip in operations. The options were to not spend on necessary players and conserve funds until big contracts are off the books (and risk missing out on top 4) or to spend now to achieve results on the field and balance things long-term with a better strategy.

I'll finish by asking you what specifically they should be doing better? What should reasonably have been done that would earn a good evaluation from you?",Manchester United,Yes,j6tldei,t1_j6tgyf0
">	Your entire argument here is based on an assumption that most of the players at the club were or are deadwood that needs to be replaced. You‚Äôve implied this numerous times.

"Number 1 for me is the handling of the Ronaldo saga from the summer and letting it drag on till the World Cup. 

They should‚Äôve taken control of that in the summer when he went AWOL instead of dumping it on ETH to try smooth over publicly while being undermined at every turn. 

A new manger barely behind the desk, clear as day where it would all end up but they let Ronaldo drive the narrative rather than being decisive. 

Embarrassing leadership treating the player as bigger than the club. Lost half a season to that drama.

Number 2 Arnold meeting fans in the pub and banging on about how much money there is to spend while subsequently failing to get the player they were after and then scrambling around with Rabiot etc toward the deadline. Embarrassing carry on.

Number 3 If ETH was forcing the FDJ thing then be a leader and put an end to it sooner of you know it‚Äôs going nowhere.

Number 4 Paper thin squad heading into an absolutely crazy run, needed more bodies (clearly plenty loan options around) only bring in a midfielder when we lose one because fans would lose it. Where is the short/medium/long term squad planning?

Number 5 Moving on players the manager clearly doesn‚Äôt rate/trust to free up funds. Nothing about them being bad players, but several clearly aren‚Äôt trusted and/or reliable. Move them on, bring in cheaper alternatives who do fit the managers preferred playing style. 

Fear of selling decent players has been a massive issue under Woodward as well.",Manchester United,Yes,j6toagv,t1_j6tmilb
"Ok, those are all good points. I would say that there are mitigating circumstances to each of them though which I'll go through below.

I agree with you on Number 1 (that Ronaldo should have been gone in May), but I understand that there is a lot more going on there than just telling him to get lost. He was under contract and up until the Piers Morgan interview showed no interest in just being cut loose without either another club lined up or getting a pay out. I have to think that if the situation lined up that United would have gotten rid. But it didn't so we had to keep him for longer. As it was I think they played that one well to avoid having to pay him out.

With number 2, I would agree that it is unwise to brag about how much money is there (a la Woodward's ""other clubs can only dream of"" speech). But that in and of itself is just posturing that doesn't change the reality of any prospective deal and the ability to get it over the line. So he can have a minus for bragging and getting fans' hopes up, but that's all I'd read into that.

With FdJ, there was way too much media smoke around that scenario to know what was really us pushing too long versus reporters trying to get clicks. On one hand, United could have asked for him in May, got told ""no"" by the player, and then moved on. On the other hand, ten Hag could have been calling FdJ right up to the deadline. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle but I think we can be happy with how the business turned out in the end.

For number 4, do we really have a ""thin"" squad in terms of the number of players in the first team squad? We're not quite current Chelsea (with about 10 extra players) but until McTominay and Eriksen got hurt we had enough bodies to cover. And if we have enough bodies then the question is how much improvement a loaned-in player would bring on such short notice, which is a case-by-case evaluation. But the injuries forced the issue and we got a player in (which is a credit to the club on such a short timeline).

Number 5 is about the only place that I absolutely disagree with you. This assumes a lot about who the manager rates or doesn't rate. There are plenty of players who are getting their chance and doing well that might have started the season as out of favour. If the manager is happy to have them as a backup and is finding a use for them, there is no need to sell and replace. And we don't have many players who aren't getting playing time at the minute and even fewer who aren't doing the job asked of them. My only criticism in this area is that players currently on loan (e.g. Telles, Bailly) weren't sold outright as we will still have to deal with them again down the road (but at least they're gone for now). Do I think we have players who should be sold? Absolutely, but I also understand that this work needs to be done gradually and as it currently stands we don't have the ability to change that much that quickly. If we don't move on and replace those players next summer then I'll start to get upset but I have no real complaints at the minute about what has happened.",Manchester United,Yes,j6tuled,t1_j6toagv
"Watching the game mate so I‚Äôll just clarify for number 5 that my main complaint there, if we assume ETH doesn‚Äôt fancy some of them which is an assumption for sure, is that we have way too many expensive (fee and salary) bench players (if they are even ever available at all).

I‚Äôll single out Maguire here, not that I think he‚Äôs a bad player, but Chelsea would have taken him it seems clear. It‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs the backup at best. We could have found a suitable  bench option for less of a fee and lower wages im sure. 

We‚Äôd have taken a loss on him no doubt but that isn‚Äôt going to change this summer. Sunk cost fallacy holding on to these players imo.",Manchester United,Yes,j6tvkkl,t1_j6tuled
"Cheers!

I think that's a matter of timing though. In the middle of the season do you stick with Maguire as the backup option (who has worked with the manager and hasn't shown any inclination to agitate for a move) or try to bed in a new player on the fly? To me, that's something you do in the summer and we've discussed why last summer wasn't really an option (already spent a lot on players). At this point as long as you don't give them a new contract to be a bench player there's no harm in having them around until the offseason (or longer if everyone is happy).

That's why I don't have complaints about the job done to date. Yes, we can't get caught up in the sunk cost fallacy but we need to analyze what is a priority problem versus a tinkering around the edges problem. We don't really have players complaining about their role, the manager seems to be giving everyone chances (i.e. not pulling an Ole and writing people off), and the team is succeeding on the field. If in the summer they decide to sell someone like Maguire and replace him with a younger, cheaper player that works for me.

I understand that on the website it says that tickets are sold out (I just saw this today) but this will likely my only chance in the near future to watch a Tottenham home game live.  
  
I hope this question is not annoying or a repeat of what others have asked in the past but I would seriously appreciate some guidance, as if it is still possible for me to attend this game I would purchase the One Hotspur membership today but just don't want to spend the money without more guidance for a single weekend I will be in London.

In a counter-attacking match like that, the opposition team play directly to his strengths. I don't think there's any coincidence that his best matches this season have come against City.

Hopefully he can take confidence from matches like that and we can play to his strengths when he's on the pitch. Between him and Porro we may be able to cover both sides of a wingback's roles, depending on what suits the match better.",Spurs,Yes,j7cd3n9,t1_j7cb93g
"Just thinking exactly the same. Fucking love Spurs and Harry so much. I cannot understand why the guy gets any stick from other fans. He‚Äôs an incredible player for club and country, one of the best in recent history. Most importantly though he‚Äôs a genuine, humble, kind and decent guy and an awesome role model for young kids.",Spurs,Yes,j7ckbj0,t1_j7chyia
meee :‚ÄôD,Spurs,Yes,j7d1rhj,t1_j7chyia
any video for it? haha,Spurs,Yes,j7cb1ny,t1_j7c9mbv
"Our pressing really has started actually getting quite good. It's obvious we've been practicing it, and we're pretty terrible at it at the start of the season. 

It can be hit and miss but its actually starting to be quite effective now.",Spurs,Yes,j7d55ig,t1_j7cav5g
"As someone who went to school during the peak Wenger years, yeah it sucked. I wasn't pathetic enough to ever want us to lose though. Also, do these people still go to school or what?",Spurs,Yes,j7c712g,t1_j7c5yj1
Stellini you mean,Spurs,Yes,j7ceqen,t1_j7ce4x2
they should be more clinical in attack. twice now gnonto has created big chance and both have been missed due to lack of concentration/bad touches.,Spurs,Yes,j7b8hx1,t1_j7b61kd
"That one counter with Son driving ahead, it was Romero and Kane making the goalscoring run.",Spurs,Yes,j7c6xnv,t1_j7c0yyu
Adding in Hugo as well,Spurs,Yes,j7c4gtx,t1_j7c3uw6
">None of that draw bullshit which helps no one

TIL, points don't help anyone...",Spurs,Yes,j7a7pmu,t1_j7a5rbk
Man City won the league by one point in the 18/19 season (98) to Liverpool‚Äôs 97. But yeah I guess that one point from a draw means nothing,Spurs,Yes,j7aemss,t1_j7a5rbk
He had a great game today but a LOT of mistakes have crept into his game recently. He's a good keeper but not been better than Donnarumma,Spurs,Yes,j7bskbe,t1_j7b9adw
"Lack of conte time would be a factor, I imagine",Spurs,Yes,j7agfde,t1_j7af70z
"Emerson hits his form of his life, I bet that he has never played this well before. Pedro Porro walking into this starting 11 might've had something to do with it.",Spurs,Yes,j7akz5f,t1_j7af70z
"Spence because they have no RBs. Cancelo is a better comparison - but really Conte just doesn't work like this, that's the real reason if he doesn't start today. 

Casemiro didn't start for ages at United iirc",Spurs,Yes,j7b65jb,t1_j7af70z
No... We don't want new manager bounce for Milan. 1:0 Inter is enough.,Spurs,Yes,j7ceqau,t1_j7cdezu
"Even if they get a cash injection there‚Äôs no way they can afford Conte and his signings

Conte‚Äôs going nowhere",Spurs,Yes,j7cervy,t1_j7cdezu
Yeah exactly. I want us to win but it won't be as annoying if we lose as it usually would. People actually hoping we lose from the off are mad.,Spurs,Yes,j7an3pq,t1_j7ady0q
"That's the thing. If you're supporting a team, you should always want them to win.

_If_ we lose then helping city against arsenal is something we should take as a positive from the game, but it's not something we should be actively cheering for before the game.",Spurs,Yes,j7alp5p,t1_j7ady0q
They're probably already down the pub - luckily they don't need a booking for a table of under 6.,Spurs,Yes,j7aqazq,t1_j7aq6o7
What was the point of an 11am protest? Who's there to see it,Spurs,Yes,j7b4zrf,t1_j7aq6o7
I don't know if I want to see Perisic vs Mahrez round 2. Would probably prefer Sess to start,Spurs,Yes,j7aufdr,t1_j7auaj9
Perisic??,Spurs,Yes,j7auto3,t1_j7auaj9
I‚Äôd rather see Emerson on the left before Perisic against Mahrez again,Spurs,Yes,j7awrc6,t1_j7auaj9
He did a lot more than get fouled today to be fair.,Spurs,Yes,j7c7ax9,t1_j7c6pts
Grealish would've been incredible with Poch,Spurs,Yes,j7cjmnn,t1_j7c6pts
"Nothing in particular, but all over the pitch we just played better. More desire to win aerials, 2nd balls, making runs.

It's like we had 2nd half Spurs for the whole game, and it was glorious.",Spurs,Yes,j7dgret,t1_j7csif3
Poll: Would you like a separate sub for all the weirdos who can't stop whinging about Arsenal all the time? Y or N.,Spurs,Yes,j7dhxuw,t1_j7dgce7
Is he suspended for a second yellow? I thought it was only straight reds that carry additional suspensions,Spurs,Yes,j7c5ir1,t1_j7c3wg3
Is it from the montage of his celebration that Spurs had up on the big screens?,Spurs,Yes,j7cd8ma,t1_j7c991r
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,Spurs,Yes,j7aw5m8,t1_j7av2ge
"I want us to win every game we can, especially today, obviously, but I‚Äôd rather we finish 5th and they finish 2nd.",Spurs,Yes,j7b28ag,t1_j7avf6r

"Everything but Arse winning the league. If it requires us to take the L today, so be it. It works both ways you know, just like City aren't out of the title race if they lose today, we aren't out of top 4 race either.",Spurs,Yes,j7bemou,t1_j7avf6r
"Kvicha wouldn't work for us, the reason he's so good for Napoli is because he's starting for them every game, for us he'd be a benchwarmer who only gets 10-15 minutes per game once Conte finally subs Son off. Not getting KMJ is a criminal mistake tho, and I'm afraid the chance to sign him is gone for good. He will go to a better club in summer, or simply stay at Napoli where he has a good chance for another scudetto next year.",Spurs,Yes,j7beazm,t1_j7b2699
We didn't have Emerzinho.,Spurs,Yes,j7c7lpp,t1_j7c7axu
"I genuinely think both city and arse will start dropping more points more regularly. Its a long long season and as we showed today and Everton even more so yesterday, if you sit in and be compact it's harder and harder to break teams down as energy levels fall and fall",Spurs,Yes,j7cq8ww,t1_j7clnmo
"Literally thought about it yesterday when I watched him against Roma. Wanted to suggest it here, but I thought I'd get laughed at because people don't know him. He was also on bayern's shortlist for this January.",Spurs,Yes,j7af3fy,t1_j7ab9uu
"I know nothing about the guy. 

Where does he excel/what are his deficiencies?",Spurs,Yes,j7aingw,t1_j7ab9uu
I was taking a shit and missed it. love him and admire him so much.,Spurs,Yes,j7by8rp,t1_j7bwz4g
No.,Spurs,Yes,j7cfhoe,t1_j7c77dy
2-1 is a bit generous for City that kfc club eh? I reckon 4-0 for us with Porro bagging a hat trick is more realistic,Spurs,Yes,j7ao1up,t1_j7amhz2
Wonder why,Spurs,Yes,j7b1okh,t1_j7b0ubz
"Our biggest transfer expenditure ever was this year, after securing top 4",Spurs,Yes,j7b2yqj,t1_j7b0ubz
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,Spurs,Yes,j7b3ejr,t1_j7b0ubz
"Bro that is just sad and some p\*ssy shit. Winners focus on winning and losers focus on winners. Spurs need to get 4th. 

Ya fuck arsenal, but if they get first that should be a bigger motivation for us next season. We want CL and need 4th.",Spurs,Yes,j7bi8qd,t1_j7bgjsy
"We have one of the easiest calendars on the league for the rest of the season, wouldn‚Äôt mind City beating us today.",Spurs,Yes,j7bkvwy,t1_j7bgjsy
"I don't know if Kulusevski would be as creative there as he is in his current position. Maybe he would, I'd just be wary of thinking he would based on how he plays in a different position.",Spurs,Yes,j7b60uj,t1_j7afs40
"> if everyone would've seen the full match,

I did. Spence had a brilliant first half, then faded in the second. His defensive positioning needs work, but then he was playing RB - a position he won't have practiced at all this season. Mostly I think he wasn't match fit, which is hardly surprising. After he went off things got much worse defensively.",Spurs,Yes,j7anznw,t1_j7aigxr
"> People judge Spence by 2-3 cherry picked clips, if everyone would've seen the full match, there wouldn't be a lot of praise.

Tell that to Rennes fans who gave him a standing ovation when he came off. I've watched the entire match, he's had a ropey 10 minutes in the end, but other than that did fine defensively, and has shown attacking quality neither of our two other senior RWB had before we got Porro. I've seen every single player in our backline outside of maybe Davies do much worse than him defensively this season.",Spurs,Yes,j7aiwqr,t1_j7aigxr
Almost as if he needs more minutes and experience at this level,Spurs,Yes,j7ajw2x,t1_j7aigxr
"You can cherry pick his areas of improvements all you like but there is no way you can justify starting Emerson over him in any match, let alone half a season.",Spurs,Yes,j7akfhi,t1_j7aigxr
His main struggle from the highlights seems to be playing out from the back. If he can tighten up his possession game playing week in week out this loan might be hugely beneficial for him,Spurs,Yes,j7ajybv,t1_j7aigxr
Only 1 game,Spurs,Yes,j7c6yfa,t1_j7c5ybr
"Straight red - 3 games

Second yellow - 1 game",Spurs,Yes,j7c7m4l,t1_j7c5ybr
I think he wanted a starting spot. And he was never going to get that at Spurs,Spurs,Yes,j7b6b2s,t1_j7ab9b1
"1. It's unlikely we'll play Wrexham. They're reasonable underdogs for their replay
2. Not convinced the added audience is an opportunity to add significantly more fans to Spurs. Casual 'Welcome to Wrexham' fans are not looking for another team to follow. They're probably not football fans in the first place. If they are they'll already be very familiar with Spurs.

It's a nice story, I like the Wrexham tale but it's a bigger opportunity for them than us. We've been in a CL final in the past 5 years",Spurs,Yes,j7b4kf3,t1_j7b2z9m
Arsenal still have to play city twice and are obviously going to drop points outside of that. Why would any apparently ‚Äòreal‚Äô fans want us to lose a big game and damage our top 4 chances in the hope city catch up to them?,Spurs,Yes,j7an50p,t1_j7alapp
What a loser,Spurs,Yes,j7an2bk,t1_j7alapp
"I go to every game at home and a few away games a year. Who gives a shit about that shitty little club? You're just a banterless coward if it'll ""wreck your life"".

Up the Spurs! As controversial as that apparently is today.",Spurs,Yes,j7algmg,t1_j7alapp
"I've seen many horrible things but this is the most dog shit spineless take

Citeh needs 5 pts to take over and they can earn more than 50 pts if they go hard, we've won zero game against above us so far and some fan wishes us to lose just for a tiny minor inconvenience for them

You are just sitting on the other side but same kind of small club minded brainlets who shouts st totteringhams day regardless of winning fuck all, on top of casual discrimination",Spurs,Yes,j7aoogn,t1_j7alapp

GTFO you plastic looser,Spurs,Yes,j7aw1yd,t1_j7alapp
Grow up,Spurs,Yes,j7b5qds,t1_j7alapp
I just wish people would chill re Spence. It's great he's looking to play week in week out and is looking good so far. But we have a world class RWB in Porro so we're fine,Spurs,Yes,j7b055a,t1_j7ax8i6
What are you on about?,Spurs,Yes,j7biep6,t1_j7bg8jw
"He did a much better job today then Porro would have. It wasn't at all Porros type of game. 

A good squad has different options, and he's a very solid defensive option.",Spurs,Yes,j7d41we,t1_j7d3tlb
"He had a very good performance against one of the best teams in Europe, on the back of having a couple of decent performances in last 2 games.

Yes, highly likely Porro will come in and do a great job as an attacking WB, does change his performance.

No need to shit on the guy, no need to caveat what was a candidate for MOTM performance.",Spurs,Yes,j7d8sh2,t1_j7d3tlb
"Think you‚Äôre going overboard on people having a bit of fun after he had a great game in a setup that suited what he‚Äôs always been pretty good at. That said, nothing like a top dollar signing at your position to light a fire.",Spurs,Yes,j7d65f8,t1_j7d3tlb
"Royal had a thundercunt cross that even Kane wasnt ready to hit properly, he's shaping up slowly i believe

That being said, can't wait to see PP steamrolling lowblocks with deki. Emerson showed today there's his place though",Spurs,Yes,j7d5fbl,t1_j7d3tlb
"The point is context. He‚Äôs been asked to do a job in a position he doesn‚Äôt play. No one is asking for him to be the nailed on starter, just asking for the guy to get a little respect for a great showing out of position. 

He doesn‚Äôt need people shitting in him and acting like he belongs in non-league football. Not everything is 0 or 100.",Spurs,Yes,j7dahr0,t1_j7d3tlb
I don't want to be hyperbolic but Royal is literally better than Messi and Ronaldo combined. We're living in Emerson's world.,Spurs,Yes,j7d7mat,t1_j7d3tlb
"Listen mate, I agree with half your opinions, but you have to learn that there is a huge space between top 5 in their position and League 2 level. A player with multiple seasons of experience in Serie A is pretty obviously not that bad.",Spurs,Yes,j7bmwk7,t1_j7bjd0j
"We haven't even seen this dude play in the premier league yet. 

Do you prefer Sessegnon over Udogie? 

What is this.",Spurs,Yes,j7bjmul,t1_j7bjd0j

I want THFC to win always,Spurs,Yes,j7aacfv,t1_j7a9ole
So what you‚Äôre saying is that you have more hate for Arsenal than support for Spurs?,Spurs,Yes,j7acjce,t1_j7a9ole
"No, they can still catch Arsenal regardless of today‚Äôs result. We need the points and the momentum it brings to our season",Spurs,Yes,j7abl1t,t1_j7a9ole
">We don't need to beat the league leaders to finish Top 4. Such games are a write off anyway.

what a shit take. if we had lost one of the matches to City last season we would have finished 5th.",Spurs,Yes,j7ac5up,t1_j7a9ole
 Man cares more about his rivals than his own team is what I‚Äôm getting from this. Fk the lot down the road. I‚Äôd rather us beat City. City have 6 points to take from the scum.,Spurs,Yes,j7al6gf,t1_j7a9ole

This just confirms what I've been thinking about people on here just being social media supporters rather than enjoying the games on TV/attending.,Spurs,Yes,j7b5njq,t1_j7amql3
I actually don't remember it at all. Probably repressed the memories of the Nuno era.,Spurs,Yes,j7cbqnz,t1_j7cb734
Form doesnt matter when its derby's west ham have been shit all season but they were good against us same with chelsea,Spurs,Yes,j7d4n0z,t1_j7cot18
"City and Arsenal both out of the way. 

Chelsea, United and Brighton fixtures are at Home.

It's not fluff, the fixtures were top loaded on the first half of season.",Spurs,Yes,j7cp8y6,t1_j7cc7n2
Plus Arsenal don‚Äôt need our help bottling the league. They can do that all on their own.,Spurs,Yes,j7a9m56,t1_j7a72kn

"Arsenal has one match in hand over City, and two over us, but they still have to play City twice so that‚Äôs a positive. If they drop points in the next few matches against Brentford, City, and Villa away there‚Äôs a good chance City can overtake them by the time those two play their second match together in April that will likely be the title decider.",Spurs,Yes,j7cgo4q,t1_j7c7iuu
This is Fantastic! Definitely sinking pints in the Bill Nick beforehand,Spurs,Yes,j7atpov,t1_j7atdf9
"Pundits are constantly yelling that Foden should be playing in midfield for England (he shouldn't), but Grealish might be the more worthwhile experiment.",Spurs,Yes,j7cfs48,t1_j7byhiz
Conte is always in charge.,Spurs,Yes,j7ahb8g,t1_j7a8xmh

Basketball wise, this has been a horrible weekend, but I'm a bigger spurs fan than basketball fan.",Spurs,Yes,j7c75wv,t1_j7c6hs9

"It‚Äôs in the post match. They go inside the dressing room where Kane‚Äôs talking to Conte who‚Äôs on the phone, he‚Äôs on speakers. Kane asks him ‚ÄòI see you Wednesday yeah?‚Äô And Dier comes screaming TWO DAYS OFF TWO DAYS OFF lmaoo

I‚Äôll try clipping it if possible but that‚Äôs what happened",Spurs,Yes,j7cbe6b,t1_j7cb1ny

"Feels good that there seem to be less and less alternative clubs for him to go to who are either big enough to match his ambition or wealthy enough to outspend us.

Like Sess has done any better at defending though. He was torn apart against Preston. Rather be on the front foot against a relatively fragile City and try to win the game personally.,Spurs,Yes,j7auk1j,t1_j7aufdr

"I used to work with a lad, 18. He was a gooner and he knew I was a Spurs supporter. One night we were out drinking, this was during the wenger days, he was wearing his arsenal shirt and getting drunk. Every so often he would grab the cannon and move it towards my face and say kiss the badge. On the third time I told him ""You do that one more time I'm going to rip that shirt from your back, drop it in the toilet and fucking shit on it. I fucking ment it. That little cunt made me so fucking angry that night. He didn't do it again. I get it.",Spurs,Yes,j7b2iwd,t1_j7aznee
Impossible,Spurs,Yes,j7b1r9f,t1_j7b1jjf
City winning today does not mean they will win the league. It just means Spurs are more likely not to finish top 4.,Spurs,Yes,j7bfx4m,t1_j7b1jjf

"Id be up for it, if available, whenever we decide ro move on from son. Hopefully son picks up some better form and stays a while longer, but I wouldnt complain as much if we ended up with Kvararaskhelia after Son.

Counting Romero who was actually signed when we were in the conference league.,Spurs,Yes,j7b38f5,t1_j7b2yqj
"I actually agree with you, but I'm saying look at that last post about spurs fans preferring to finish 17th over Arsenal winning the league. Even if we ""want that"" we NEED to win today. Spurs losing today means Spurs are less likely to finish top 4. It does NOT mean Arsenal are less likely to win the league. We control our own fate.",Spurs,Yes,j7bjk4p,t1_j7bi8qd
"nope, a bad loss to City today can ruin the whole rest of the Season. Team Morale is also important in these top 4 races as well as the locker room.",Spurs,Yes,j7blasp,t1_j7bkvwy
"You may think you can justify it, but the reality is we‚Äôve seen 4 clips from one game and now you think he‚Äôs the new Messi. I‚Äôd back Conte‚Äôs decision over any fans.

"You literally can. Emerson for all his faults provides good defensive cover, especially when Romero pushes forward at times.

"1. No, they're not going to just ""obviously"" drop points if you've watched their matches.   
2. It is not a ""big game"" for us as winning it will not give us a trophy nor losing it will relegate us.      
3. Top 4 is not a trophy which we should be chasing.

All I ask is for people to watch the player I‚Äôm talking about instead of making generalised assumptions,Spurs,Yes,j7bny9j,t1_j7bmwk7
You don‚Äôt need to see someone to play in the PL to determine whether they‚Äôre good currently or not,Spurs,Yes,j7bkxwx,t1_j7bjmul
"Yeah but hes been made out off glass since he played through an injury for everton, getting another striker aint a bad idea",Spurs,Yes,j7b8wzh,t1_j7apgqs

"haha fairs,   
but I thinks its common agreement that Royal is a great RB but bad RWB",Spurs,Yes,j7cfcqo,t1_j7cbqnz
Just be aware I think they're a bit understaffed at the moment. When I was there for the Arsenal game it took me 20 mins standing at the bar to get served. Ended up in the No.8 instead where service was rapid.,Spurs,Yes,j7b1t9p,t1_j7atpov
Barca scored 3 goals after they both came on together,Spurs,Yes,j7czxz1,t1_j7cx44t
"Kinda cliche but you should focus on things that are in your control. Had they converted the 2 big chances they would have been clear 2-1 or atleast be on level terms. PL refs have been shite all season, can't think of a single gameweek without a ref blunder.",Spurs,Yes,j7bab9q,t1_j7b8xh1
"lol, a point can make the difference between champions league and europa league.especially in a season where we have a worse GD than the teams above and below us on the table

and a lot of good beating city did for our momentum last year",Spurs,Yes,j7a8yqo,t1_j7a8o0o
"Drawing to the league winners 100% builds momentum for us, what are you on about?",Spurs,Yes,j7ac1ju,t1_j7a8o0o

">  He was torn apart against Preston.

????",Spurs,Yes,j7auubx,t1_j7auk1j
If he was against Preston I didn't notice it. I feel like you can trust him to handle his man but he did admittedly not have a great showing against Saka,Spurs,Yes,j7auqt5,t1_j7auk1j

"Romero can't be himself and play CCB, would be a disaster",Spurs,Yes,j7c768f,t1_j7c5nou
"As I said, works both ways, but losing today increases the chance of City winning the league and that's the scenario I'd always take over us getting top 4 but scum ending 1st. I don't know if one can call himself a Spurs fan if he's fine with them winning PL, it means he doesn't understand this rivalry at all.

Don't take this personally btw., I saw your other comment. It's directed more at all the folk here who think them winning the league is not a big deal.",Spurs,Yes,j7bgtsy,t1_j7bfsvi
"Would you rather count Porro instead, considering we've actually signed him this season? The result is the same.",Spurs,Yes,j7b4b0q,t1_j7b38f5
It totally does because City are the team we are playing.,Spurs,Yes,j7bn0ry,t1_j7bjk4p
">Some of you ‚ÄòConte‚Äôs and idiot‚Äô fans have somehow got this attitude that you know more than a man who is a serial winner. Know your ignorance

It's the other way around actually. Some of you seem to just worship him and think he can do no wrong even when he has regressed the squad vs last season even after getting 7 new signings. The delusion in you lot is astounding. Our results don't lie. Just open your fucking eyes.",Spurs,No,j7aneuk,t1_j7alt3f
"I am amazed how some of you start believing Emerson is good even after literally seeing him kill our games and us having a shit season because of him.   

Open your eyes when you watch our games. please.",Spurs,Yes,j7an40g,t1_j7am73p
"Of course, real spurs fans should hope we slip back into europa/conference league mediocrity and not compete in the best tournaments. No game is an important game if it‚Äôs not a cup final as well, of course.",Spurs,Yes,j7apvja,t1_j7anu8x
"Nah mate, sorry, you're wrong.

You're just a scared little coward. Scared of gooner fans too, give me strength.

"Oh yeah absolutely. Its horses for courses. But he is a useful option now I think. He's also just got unbelievable mentality as well. Man was booed off and on to the pitch in 2 different games, but his head didnt drop at all. It's actually pretty mad when you think how few players wouldnt be affected by that. 

He seems like a good bloke too and liked in the dressing room.",Spurs,Yes,j7d5nmk,t1_j7d4dhd
"Underexaggerated? I couldn't agree more. I forgot to include Cafu on that list. 

Guaranteed Balon d'Or winner for the next decade",Spurs,Yes,j7dfc0m,t1_j7db2cv

"No doubt they've been wasteful, but should be comfortably winning this",Spurs,Yes,j7bc55u,t1_j7bab9q
"Sess didn't have great games against Arsenal or Preston. He has pace but I can't see him being Tactically effective going forward against Man City. On the other hand Perisic has less pace and wasn't great at defending against Man City last time around. We kind of need someone with an extremely high work rate to constantly press, harass, and unsettle in that position. I don't know the answer.",Spurs,Yes,j7avp2d,t1_j7auqt5
Yeah and Saka took Sess for a joy ride just a few weeks ago. At least Perisic offers something going forward.,Spurs,Yes,j7avvxk,t1_j7av7b7
"I hate Chelsea more than Arsenal. I am way more jealous of Chelsea and their sugar daddy money. Even if Arsenal win the league, they will never win a Champions League which is still a good thing.",Spurs,Yes,j7bhija,t1_j7bgtsy
We've signed him BECAUSE Top 4 is threatened again. Jan window would have been different if we were coasting along at 3rd.,Spurs,Yes,j7b5fcg,t1_j7b4b0q
"City can rebound from a loss to Spurs. 

Can't say the same with Spurs.",Spurs,Yes,j7bn7tf,t1_j7bn0ry
"Please look at our team as a whole. We have more problems than Emerson Royal. We have issues with our fucking midfielders during transitional phases, our CBs outside of Romero are wank & one of our attackers literally cannot score to save his life while still playing near full 90s nearly twice a week.

But sure, all of our problems come from Emerson Royal & we replace him with a player who clearly hasn‚Äôt picked up the game at the level required for him to be a starter for us solves everything.",Spurs,Yes,j7aoxi3,t1_j7an40g
"> us having a shit season because of him.

Yeah it's definitely Emerson, who is playing exactly like he did last season, not Son and Lloris who forgot how to play football",Spurs,Yes,j7aq2qa,t1_j7an40g
Emerson the reason we‚Äôre losing this game & killing all our attacks?,Spurs,Yes,j7buw5s,t1_j7an40g
Mf i‚Äôm waiting,Spurs,Yes,j7cb2sb,t1_j7an40g
"real fans hope we spend money and compete for titles - not this shit show of ""I hope we get top 4"". ENIC has you on strings - they invest just enough to compete for Top 4 and not more than that.   

Real fans don't talk about finishing Top 4.",Spurs,Yes,j7aq2f0,t1_j7apvja
"It's not about the gooner fans. Nobody gives a fuck about those losers. 

Again, as I said, you don't know anything because you're hardly connected to the club. Forming baseless arguments and arguing online just like the tourist plastic fan that you are.",Spurs,Yes,j7an8g9,t1_j7alv0w
Fans of the club are fans of the club if they want the best for the club. If they want the best for ENIC then they are just ENIC fans.,Spurs,Yes,j7ao2ht,t1_j7anqwy

"> Yeah and Saka took Sess for a joy ride just a few weeks ago

Saka got past Sess zero (0) times. Lloris not being able to save a shot straight at his face really made people think Sess got destroyed huh.",Spurs,Yes,j7aw81y,t1_j7avvxk
Sessegnon made Saka shoot from an angle that should‚Äôve been a routine save for Lloris how did he get taken for a joyride?,Spurs,Yes,j7ayml3,t1_j7avvxk
Might want to watch that again pal,Spurs,Yes,j7b4wjw,t1_j7avvxk
"This summer window we got Richarlison, Bissouma, Perisic, and Lenglet for the first team, last season in the summer we got Romero and Emerson. We've definitely done more to strengthen the team this summer, even if you only count one window for some reason.",Spurs,Yes,j7b6ftk,t1_j7b5fcg
"I think we can rebound from a loss against a good team, it's rougher when we lose to worse teams. But agree with your sentiment in this thread completely",Spurs,Yes,j7bs6hs,t1_j7bn7tf

"You must not be a fan of the club then if you want them to lose the fucking game on purpose, that's not wanting what's best for the club. Get a grip ‚Äúreal fan‚Äù",Spurs,Yes,j7aqm68,t1_j7aq2f0
Real fans that go to games enjoy watching CL over Europa or Conference.,Spurs,Yes,j7aql87,t1_j7aq2f0
"Real fans want us to finish as high as possible and win as many games as possible. It's not about top 4, it's about winning over losing",Spurs,Yes,j7b5udp,t1_j7aq2f0
"Plastic because I have a season ticket and want spurs to win their games..? Genuinely intrigued if you understand what the word plastic means? Because wanting your team to lose so that their rivals might have a slightly harder go of it half a season down the line is getting pretty fucking close to polymerisation.

Either way, I'm more connected than you'll ever be, sunshine. If I were any more involved with spurs I'd have fuck all else going on in my life. As apparently is the case with you. You plastic :)",Spurs,Yes,j7anjjt,t1_j7an8g9

"This is a another take he‚Äôs wrong with (to a degree) he‚Äôs raw yes but he‚Äôs explosive and a top goal scorer for his age (and he‚Äôs a wingback lol) guy will need a lot of coaching like any young player but will develop into a top player under Conte.

"Unrelated, but I've just realised your name is a Tame Impala reference, right on!",Spurs,Yes,j76a0uo,t1_j7682ia
"He wasn't horrible on defence, stop taking Kunt's opinion at face value. He was fine for 70 minutes, and below par for 10. They conceded 2 goals in the ten minutes after he was taken off, so the idea that he was somehow their defensive weak spot is ridiculous.",Spurs,Yes,j78jyp0,t1_j78j1sr
"Listen, we should root for the Spurs to win. What is this small club mentality lol. If they lose, fine we can be less pissed, but we should still want Spurs to win. Obviously City should be the favorites anyway, so there is no point in rooting for City to win tomorrow.",Spurs,Yes,j76v8xq,t1_j76trwz

"Nobody, they won't sack him and rightly so, he's top 3 managers in the world, won the league and CL. Only until after he won all the biggest trophies have they since fallen into a multi-year injury crisis affecting their most important players, all whilst they haven't backed him at all. Needed a midfielder for three years and they buy 6 attackers. 

FSG clearly looking to sell, there's no one better available. It would be absolutely insane to sack him from every conceivable perspective. He's not going anywhere unless he quits.",Spurs,Yes,j79bkds,t1_j798mai

"> the opposition have an easy day down his side

They definitely didn't, they had like one good attack from the left.

>Even though he‚Äôs good 1v1 unlike Romero, his off ball positioning + work rate is downright shite

He's been there for 4 days, playing in an unfamiliar formation as an RB instead of his natural RWB. People were saying Emerson was defensively shit after he was thrown against Zaha after being with us for like 4 days.",Spurs,Yes,j78ft3a,t1_j78fivt
"Even though he‚Äôs good 1v1 unlike Romero, 

i'm sorry what? You still on this? Romero is still a top 10 CB in the league even if he is off-form. Keep sucking off Hitchens. 

You can say Emerson is a shit signing, but Romero? What are talking about?",Spurs,Yes,j78ikh9,t1_j78fivt
I wouldn't go that far but I'd definitely agree Romero isn't a great defender in terms of leaving a ton of space behind him and losing his man. Genuinely elite ball player and he times his last ditch tackles well though.,Spurs,Yes,j78iz4w,t1_j78fivt
Norwich didn't have the legend that is Dyche.,Spurs,Yes,j75snvr,t1_j75mrdp
If there is one man who can get a relegation team to beat top of the table it‚Äôs Sean Dyche. In Dyche we trust.,Spurs,Yes,j75vj3z,t1_j75mrdp
why not,Spurs,Yes,j774v9p,t1_j77063z

"He won‚Äôt get half a billion to rebuild the squad here. Every decent PL manager having so much to spend on rebuild would be near the top. Btw, he‚Äôs an ex gunner, why would we want him here",Spurs,Yes,j774kev,t1_j7747d8
"No way, I've said it forever, if they backed Emery the same way they backed Arteta they would have been in their current position just as quick if not sooner.

When you spend like they have, year after year, their current position should be the expectation, not a surprise.",Spurs,Yes,j774zmm,t1_j7747d8

We're doing the Liverpool thing where we're waiting on a good player that we probably won't get Gvardiol/Bellingham only to miss out on good players that we could've gotten Badiashile/KMJ/Enzo just because we need a 100% success at that position so instead we go a whole season with a shit defense/Midfield,Spurs,Yes,j760qs4,t1_j75opia
"Yeah my question wasn‚Äôt great tbf, I‚Äôm Salernitana and the transfer window has just closed, I‚Äôm 5 games in to the season and haven‚Äôt scored a goal yet lmao but also the defence is very leaky (doesn‚Äôt help that my captain is Fazio). I think my midfield has been the issue with a lack of defensive cover because I‚Äôve been playing 433 which must be too expansive for the players I‚Äôve got. 

Would a 4222 with 2 dms be a solid base for me to build from?",Spurs,Yes,j76j2n5,t1_j76irxl
The haircut gives him a punchable face,Spurs,Yes,j75qx73,t1_j75p4r7
"I know utd fans were pissed, but grabbing someone's neck should be a serious penalty. I'd give him 5 games tbh",Spurs,Yes,j7785jw,t1_j777pz7
Agreed üòÜ,Spurs,Yes,j76qe98,t1_j76q88c
"Yet I do understand the merits of Emerson starting, and he has been good recently (even scored against City) but I can't wait to watch Porro play lol",Spurs,Yes,j777lzd,t1_j77580p
"Yeah but tbf its easy to sometimes criticize players for not making the correct decision from our view on tele, its a lot more difficult to spot and find the correct pass when you are on the pitch.

Agree about bentancur, Sess is another player who I think has great decision making but his execution has been very poor lately.",Spurs,Yes,j77t1d5,t1_j77ongg
"Sort of like Poch at PSG

think we need to rethink this idea that there are managers who are good in every situation. Pep Guardiola is an amazing manager but I‚Äôd like to see what he does with a relegation tier squad. Sean Dyche was class for Burnley but he likely wouldn‚Äôt really know what to do with a squad like City‚Äôs

Managing a top tier squad to win the league is very different to managing plucky underdogs to maybe get into European spots",Spurs,Yes,j76de0j,t1_j7686xu
Why feel bad for him? Supposedly he thought himself above Spurs when we were looking for a manager and ended up with Nuno.,Spurs,Yes,j760j1i,t1_j75yx4a

"Right. Makes sense with Son, Richi who can play there and the signing of Danjuma. Just can‚Äôt help but think how creative our attack would be at the wings with Kulu, Mitoma, Porro and Perisic/maybe Udogie.",Spurs,Yes,j77kqe8,t1_j77jcxu
"Agreed, but I doubt he‚Äôs going anywhere. Much of the new talent they‚Äôve brought in is with his system in mind.  He‚Äôll be given  at least most of next season to right the ship.",Spurs,Yes,j77j42p,t1_j77fyq1
Think he‚Äôd take a break or leave the prem and not come back. Doesn‚Äôt really have anything to prove here anymore and it‚Äôs clear hes not going to be backed until FSG sells,Spurs,Yes,j7827yk,t1_j77fyq1
"I rate Porro way higher than Spence. I definitely don‚Äôt have an obsession with him, don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre getting that from. I am just sick and tired of that donkey Emerson.

Yeah but a big chance Liverpool will sack or Klopp will want to get out. In that case..,Spurs,Yes,j79bx2m,t1_j79bkds
"Absolutely not me thinks. The league has been shifting in terms of managerial style since the COVID season. The end of high intensity , high pressing football **as a philosophy** is here. It is a cycle that needs to be reset every 4-5 seasons and a team need absolute precision in recruitment to navigate that. Plus the league has seen a lot of managers willing to adapt their systems to different style thrive in recent times like Tuchel,De Zerbi,Howe,Silva, Frank while not compromising their core view of footballing philosophy \[Poch is closest manager we have had who fits this description\]. We need a manager who plays attacking football,  but who isn't afraid to switch things up to win than an Anti-Conte who just plays attacking football but is adamant in implementing his style.",Spurs,Yes,j79iilp,t1_j79g78h
"Of course, also one player who absolutely will marvel in a Klopp system is Son.",Spurs,Yes,j79gfoz,t1_j79g78h

What has happened to this sub?",Spurs,Yes,j78jn3w,t1_j78iz4w
"The only reason it‚Äôs ‚Äòlast ditch‚Äô in the first place is because he doesn‚Äôt position himself correctly

Definitely agree with you!",Spurs,Yes,j77bjja,t1_j778ia8

In what world could we ever have afforded Enzo,Spurs,Yes,j76bdeb,t1_j760qs4
"I think a 4-2-2-2 can work but you leave yourself very light in midfield. A 4-4-2 would be better for a smaller team I think, it‚Äôs much more compact whereas a 4-2-4 is very expansive but it‚Äôs difficult to find traditional wingers in a top league. 

If you think you can score goals at the expense of defence I think it‚Äôs better to play a 4-2-4 like if you believe you can outscore the opponent but you haven‚Äôt scored a goal so it‚Äôs a holistic issue which in real football is solved by reverting to something simple and compact. 

Something else that can work is a 4-2-3-1 with a Shadow Striker or an AM and then an asymmetric midfield with a DM on one side and a CM on the other because the CM will naturally drop deep when you don‚Äôt have the ball especially if he‚Äôs a B2B. Sometimes I wish FM had a ‚Äúwith the ball‚Äù and a ‚Äúwithout the ball‚Äù tactic so you could set up different shapes because that‚Äôs how it works in real football.

But ultimately there‚Äôs no like one size fits all tactic, like some bits of this might work for you, others won‚Äôt and I think the best way to do it is to pick a tactic and then make small tweaks to it once your side is familiar with it and identify one problem at a time to fix and most importantly try not to panic about it and change things wholesale when your team has already become used to a tactic.

If all else fails download a tactic and say you made it lol",Spurs,Yes,j76klyv,t1_j76j2n5
Yankable hair surely,Spurs,Yes,j75tg0t,t1_j75qx73
I would give him 15 games tbh,Spurs,Yes,j77cj6c,t1_j7785jw
Yeah I was going to make that point. There are shades of grey here for sure. Sometimes certain things are not ‚Äúseen‚Äù on pitch as well. But it‚Äôs not necessarily about vision IQ. Decision making has as much to do with operating within a limited vision even. Interesting point about Sess. I‚Äôve never seen him as a ‚Äúhigh IQ‚Äù sort‚Ä¶.Any examples of that from earlier?,Spurs,Yes,j77wvcu,t1_j77t1d5
Just comes across like a nice man,Spurs,Yes,j7631bt,t1_j760j1i
So do you think if Spence came in and showed promise we‚Äôd get the higher rate win now player that Porro promised to be? Mate what I‚Äôm telling you is that Conte knows better than us what it takes for Levy to prioritize spending. Two quality wingbacks make us a menace next season,Spurs,Yes,j78ijxm,t1_j78i0ax

It‚Äôs about how compact and deep you want to be, you should be wary of playing TOO deep because FM doesn‚Äôt like that.

It can be trained because in Argentina‚Äôs back 4, he‚Äôs exactly like that. It‚Äôs controlled aggression not all out aggression like how he is for us. It‚Äôs so only because he knows he doesn‚Äôt have cover and can‚Äôt jeopardise the back line by going for a ball that‚Äôs not his and losing the duel. Watch him for Spurs and he does that regularly. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôd do well in a back 4 if continuously switched on and doesn‚Äôt forget the fact that he has no cover

"Totally agreed. A big breakthrough for me to stop trying to analyze the situation was reading someone say *not everyone is career-focused, footballers included*. Everyone is entitled to take their job as seriously or not as they want, and that includes professional athletes.

"For about 3 years I was completely with you. But for it to happen repeatedly under different managers and then different clubs I had to give in.

delicate balance.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe danger,‚Äù he writes in his book, ‚Äúremains that he‚Äôll forget what has  
 got him to this point. I‚Äôve had to repeat that to him this season. The   
other risk is whether those around him know how to treat a top-level

Add to that most fans here are overseas and the trust mainly represent the local match-going fanbase then you get lots of people confused about who they are and what they do.

"Every fan is entitled to be a fan however they wish. But I personally don't care enough about Arsenal to want us to lose any match, let alone to City at home. Any dropped points makes it that much harder for us to get top 4, which needs to be our goal for the league this season.

Also, worth remembering that City have 2 matches still against Arsenal. If City don't win the league, it'll be because they didn't take advantage of those matches.",Spurs,Yes,j72nfmp,t1_j72lftg

"I 1000% agree with you about ""the next best alternative"" approach we should have, and that's where I think our scouting needs to be exponentially better. Paratici has hired some new scouting talent, so hopefully that leads to improvement in finding those players that flop less often.

I think that's a bit of a harsh assessment of our midfield, but not overly harsh.

* I think PEH would be a fantastic squad player, but I generally agree that we should look to upgrade on his technical ability if we can. Squad players are an important part of a ""title-winning core in midfield"".
* At worst, jury is still out on Bissouma. He deserves at least until some part through next season to prove himself. Different players take different amounts of time to bed into a new environment, new team & teammates, new manager, new systems of play, etc.
* If you think Sarr has the potential, then I think Skipp does as well and he's demonstrated it during Conte's early days. I know that's a matter of personal opinion, 

Of all the general positions to improve on, I don't think midfield is the one to focus in on as opposed to centerbacks.",Spurs,Yes,j72cebw,t1_j7291j5

"This is all factually incorrect, do you really believe any of this deep down?",Spurs,Yes,j72ie2h,t1_j71tocg
"Perhaps because we are realistic and not fantasists.  I have been watching Spurs for coming up 35 years and ENIC have delivered the best teams of that period barring the very start of it.  We were left a long, long way behind the curve due to being absolute rubbish and insolvent when the Premier League kicked off.  We also got the hammer for financial irregularities and were nearly relegated as penalty.

Poch was a victim of his own success, and failure.  Half the amazing team he had was there when he took over and his choices in the transfer market  - ie don't sign anybody at all and do sign GLC, Ndombele etc - have ruined us for years.  It is completely false to suggest this is all down to ENIC wanting to turn a profit.

We didn't cost-cut at RWB for Spence, we invested in a young player who may well end up making us a profit or being a first team player.  We couldn't get Porro in the summer despite trying as Paratici himself said.

We are competing in the PL and we are improving the squad, we're just not the best team and don't have the deepest pockets.  What you seem to aspire to is being the next Chelsea or Man City which almost nobody really wants deep down.  It will be the end of the club in spirit.  

It would do fans, especially new fans, to get real about what kind of club we are and what is possible.  We can be better, but the only way we spend big is to earn big.  That has been the focus for the last several years.  We are in a position to continuously invest in the squad but we are never going to financially dope the team.  

In 2017 our revenue was 180m behind Chelsea, 200m behind Arsenal 250m behind City and >400m behind United.   Why ever didn't we outspend them while building a stadium?  The answers are bloody obvious.

The only path to success is to incrementally build the team (and be good at recruiting instead of very poor) or to sell out the club to a gulf state and financially the dope the team.  Bahrain FC.

"There was a report today that they're not going to pay 25m for him, but are considering buying him at a discount, so I guess that clause wasn't put in place. Still, getting rid of him at any price would be a good thing at this point.",Spurs,Yes,j71htv5,t1_j71hcpi
"I hope so, he came from playing a similar system and the wingback role is pretty well defined. You see teams like Chelsea chucking Enzo straight into the starting 11, we should be confident to do the same. Porro is class and can handle it.",Spurs,Yes,j73689o,t1_j7317yy
Good god get a grip,Spurs,Yes,j71itw5,t1_j70vrin

If you can look past the occasional danny rant vftl has been very good for a while now especially due to Eccleshare. His replacement Tim spiers on the other hand is a very boring guy and from his tweets/coverage of spurs he doesn't enjoy covering spurs either so hopefully Eccleshare returns soon.,Spurs,Yes,j73f9fz,t1_j72wdm0

"What a dumb comment. If we ever want to catch up, having cl gives us an advantage as we have more financial capability and pull.

">they aren't using this position to make the football club actually challenge for trophies

This line is so critical to me.   

Seasons after seasons of Top 4 have given us nothing.   

What was the reward for finishing Top 4 last season? A Clement Lenglet on loan and our defence being even worse than last season with Dier and Lloris declining.   

Top 4 should just not be counted as an achievement. It's only an agenda by ENIC since it helps them with more revenue. It gives us nothing as fans.",Spurs,Yes,j71s5jf,t1_j71j3vi

Yeah I think Regui going on loan has more to do with him recovering from his long injuries in his home country than it has to do with Conte not liking him. I think he still has a future here.,Spurs,Yes,j72q3uw,t1_j72luyo
Mmm Perisic was a winger and he went to Bayern and came back to be more defensive to adapt to the wing back role. Reguilon is a defender and he sure ain‚Äôt going to get more attacking skills at athletico,Spurs,Yes,j72qbtq,t1_j72luyo

"Sutalo for me is a tremendous CCB option, with his height and ability to play out of the back. He is that guy who you just know will be world class in the future, like with Varane back in the days.",Spurs,Yes,j72kz9g,t1_j72kq9w
Did he play at the WC? I didn't see him,Spurs,Yes,j72r3wj,t1_j72kq9w
if utilized properly Bissouma absolutely would fit into a title winning team. i'm just not sure if we'll ever deploy him to his strengths,Spurs,Yes,j72aswq,t1_j729iyv

"What a stupid reduction. All I'm saying is that we should aim higher than Top 4.

Roflmao. Enlighten me Mr. I know all facts.,Spurs,Yes,j72p7lm,t1_j72ie2h
"Look you and I are saying the same thing. The 35 year journey that you talked about and building the team incrementally is what I agree with and it is what we've done till now. Where you're wrong is the piece below:     

>We are competing in the PL and we are improving the squad, we're just not the best team and don't have the deepest pockets. What you seem to aspire to is being the next Chelsea or Man City which almost nobody really wants deep down. It will be the end of the club in spirit.    

Yes we're not the best team but we could've been. And it doesn't need oil money or 100m signings - KMJ was right there which we slipped on. Similarly, the haggling that we do and miss out on Bruno, Skriniar, Grealish, Porro (almost) has to stop and get the right talent over a second choice in GLC, Rodon, Spence. We waste more money turning over the squad than what we would've spent getting them first time right.    

And I'm not aspiring to be the next Chelsea/Man City. All I'm aspiring for is to win the PL which we should all aspire for.    

As the club motto itself says ""It is better to fail aiming high (PL Win) than to succeed aiming low (Top 4)"". Let's do justice to it please.",Spurs,Yes,j71z69e,t1_j71wkyl
Grip on what?,Spurs,Yes,j71oh91,t1_j71itw5
"I see it as an investment. One loss can be massively useful if it prevents Arsenal from winning the league - every point matters.    

Similarly, a red card is an investment to ensure Porro plays - which ensures we win more from next game onwards. If Emerson continues playing we would lose future matches.",Spurs,Yes,j710bo0,t1_j70zkgq
"I don't want a win which gives them the title. It's as simple as that. Not evry fan has a myopic view around football about ""their club only"" like you.",Spurs,Yes,j7118d7,t1_j710xm9

That's exactly what I'm saying. We do try for this but club's ""Top 4 is good enough"" mentality is what stop it from going further. If we aimed higher, we would have leveraged on the Top 4 and not just hired Conte but also upgraded his defence to make us competitive for the title.

"Biggest shake up to football ownership in years leaked - what it means for your club

- Dodgy owners will be blocked from getting hold of our footie teams under a huge clean-up.

- It would mean the likes of sanctioned Russian Roman Abramovich would be kept out of the Premier League.

- Fans will get a say in running clubs and stop bosses radically changing logos and kits.

- Clubs will fund a regulator which will have powers to ban them from breakaway leagues.

The major shake-up will also:

- Ban greedy clubs from joining a breakaway competition like the European Super League ‚Äî which triggered huge protests by fans in 2021.

- Tax teams an annual fee to fund the regulator and expose them to breach sanctions.

- Let the regulator raid money from the Premier League to help prop up lower leagues.

- The charter plans to tackle murky moneymen and stop them from getting their hands on our clubs ‚Äî to defend teams against financial and cultural ruin.

- A new regulator will enforce four tough terms clubs must meet to gain a legal licence.

- Teams must only take part in tournaments that have been approved by the regulator ‚Äî meaning a ban on ‚Äúbreakaway‚Äù competitions such as the proposed European Super League.

- Wannabe proprietors will face robust checks on their ‚Äúsource of wealth‚Äù. It means multi-millionaires who cannot prove they amassed their fortune legitimately will not be allowed to complete takeovers.

- This seemingly rules out oligarchs eyeing Premier League sides and grifters who have previously put smaller teams at risk. 

- Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan wants the regulator in place for the 2024/5 season and will formally unveil legislation imminently.
Under the proposals ‚Äî expected to be signed off by Cabinet shortly ‚Äî all clubs in the top five flights of English football would need to gain a fresh licence to play from the regulator.

- They would be charged a yearly levy ‚Äî with richer clubs paying more and small sides less.

- But getting the permit depends on meeting tough criteria, including a rigorous vetting of prospective owners and directors. The regulator would carry out due diligence checks so undesirable investors are prevented from staging a takeover.

- More than 60 sides have gone bust since the Premier League was founded in 1992. 

- The reforms could set ministers on a collision course with clubs resistant to more regulation. 

- The regulator would require clubs to have deep enough pockets to stop themselves going bust ‚Äî and establish a new code of conduct ensuring financial stability.",Spurs,No,j6wc9h3,t3_10rigkm

"Delofue is balling at Udinese, he would've been great as a depth option",Spurs,Yes,j6wfaoa,t1_j6wezzx

"Scalvini would be great. Only 19 and already a starter for Atalanta and his stats are looking really great - especially for his age. He‚Äôs versatile, can play everywhere in a back 3 and even played as a DM here and there. 
But he‚Äôs Italian and highly rated. It will be difficult and pricy to get. But not impossible. And if we can spend ~¬£60m on Richarlison as a backup, Scalvini should be doable.",Spurs,Yes,j6w8prr,t1_j6w4wrj

"I hope he does and I think he will, barring the bottom falling out over the rest of the season. I believe him when he's said repeatedly that he believes in the project --- he's a lot of things but hasn't ever struck me as a bullshit artist, whatever job he's been in. I also think he would still \*love\* to be the guy to take the club that everyone thinks isn't supposed to be able do it to the top.

Also, while things can change, not sure there's another obvious place to go as another better option right now? He's already done the sabbatical thing and it didn't seem to suit him. Italian NT? Been there, done that and Mancini's still there anyway. Maybe Juve before this mess, but hard to see it now. Can't think of another obvious high profile PL vacancy on the horizon and I think so long as he wants to be managing he wants to be at the center of the European league universe.",Spurs,Yes,j6yfm9e,t1_j6y1x2d

"It's been a long time since we've had a top quality #6 or #8.

You're comparing 2 clubs with completely different financial setups tbf. Comparing us to lpool is a much better comparison. And the difference between us and them sadly is they didn't have ndombele flops.....they got all their bug transfers right for a period and we got all ours wrong.,Spurs,Yes,j6ylajh,t1_j6yhxmj
"Sorry but this is missing the mark.

We can't financially cope with our biggest signings being shit, and you need at least a 50/50 success rate on signings, ours has been far worse until Paratici.  

The Loan/obligation does nothing except keep us good with accounting periods and spread costs between years.  It doesn't give us an out if they are obligations.  

The goal of the board is to grow the club into a commercial beast so that it self-funds top-level investment in the team.  They refuse to bank-roll player investment as if it is their plaything and I am ok with that.  For me the investment level is completely fine and plenty of clubs do far better with less money.  What we really need is to have a proper recruitment strategy and bring some youngsters through.  That's exactly what they said they are focused on.",Spurs,Yes,j6z8ppd,t1_j6yhxmj
Young winger at Sevilla called Gil may be a good shout,Spurs,Yes,j6wacy9,t1_j6w3vb6
"It's a real tricky one. Not Kane replacement tricky, but not far from it imo.

 Kulu is basically a nailed on starter for years to come if he keeps doing what he's doing, and we are not a team constantly directly involved in the title race.

So we can't act like a Man City and bring in Mahrez and Grealish who are happy to play second fiddle to Foden and Sterling for quite a while, because they realize they're winning leagues/strongly challenging for the UCL.

So in my opinion, that takes guys like the above-mentioned Raphinha off the table.

It would have to be a younger player with something to prove, or a veteran looking for one last big gig, but I prefer the first one.

Kudus, Zaniolo after this whole Roma mess (if Conte stays), and Olise being my top 3.",Spurs,Yes,j6w5h0a,t1_j6w3vb6
"It's helpful to have backups with a slightly different style, which gives options from the bench.  Given that Kulu is creative/intelligent/inverted, would be good to have a right footed speed merchant as his backup.",Spurs,Yes,j6w475y,t1_j6w3vb6
Kudus would be good. Suprosed noone went for him in Jan,Spurs,Yes,j6w49tc,t1_j6w3vb6

Also, Conte hasn‚Äôt gotten a single player under Enic, is ‚Äúhung out too dry‚Äù, and I‚Äôve now seen three claim that Enic/Levy is what caused Conte‚Äôs gallbladder problems. 

I think Levy and Enic have made a number of mistakes. But the current ‚Äúlet‚Äôs turn any issue at all into a Levy proble‚Äô‚Äù, has the opposite effect on me, makes me want to distance myself from any EnicOut posts.",Spurs,Yes,j6xk97s,t1_j6wmg64

"Sad more about Doherty the person and less about the player. Yes he wasn‚Äôt fantastic but he was very well liked in the locker room, had a level head on his shoulders, and worked hard. Doherty the player definitely wasn‚Äôt good enough to be a starting Conte wingback, but Doherty the person deserved a better exit.",Spurs,Yes,j6vybb4,t1_j6vxwl2
"Yeah I respect him and his attitude but these are the kinds of players that need to go, he just isn't at the level required.

Spurs supporters are loyal to a fault, we need to get a bit more ruthless with refreshing the squad",Spurs,Yes,j6vyb2t,t1_j6vxwl2
"I mean yeah outside of that February-April run last year his spurs career has been underwhelming but that during that run he did look great and was a reason we finished top 4. Regardless reasons why spurs fans are upset. 

1. He is friends with Harry. Outside of Eric, Doherty was Harry‚Äôs second closest personal friend on the team and losing a player who Harry is close with probably makes our Kane retention chances go down ever more slightly (I know this is stupid, Harry Kane isn‚Äôt staying at spurs because he likes a player but I guarantee you this is going through at least a few peoples head)

2. He‚Äôs not Emerson 

3. Why do you terminate a player and not sell him it just looked like the club completely mismanaged the situation into terminating a player who wasn‚Äôt causing an issue like how many clubs fucking terminate players that are well liked? 

4. The only opportunity he got a consistent run of minutes in his preferred position he looked good. He hasn‚Äôt seen consistent minutes this season. 

5. He‚Äôs an attacking RWB so looks better emerson

6. He‚Äôs not Emerson 

7. Didn‚Äôt get a dime for him in the transfer market. 

8. Spurs fans thought we were going to exchange Porro for Emerson and have Porro and Doherty which they were content with, but now we have Porro and Emerson 

9. He‚Äôs versatile and looked competent at LWB virtually covering two positions in one player 

10. Spurs fans really fucking hate Emerson",Spurs,Yes,j6vyn38,t1_j6vxwl2
"Not 100% but I'm pretty sure we're all aware of how unspectacular he had been. Just the abrupt nature of his termination caught us off guard. At the end of the day, he hadn't caused any problems off the pitch, had been diligent on the training ground, and always put in a shift while on the pitch. Despite his subpar to below par performances, I think he rightfully deserves to have some fans miss him for these things.",Spurs,Yes,j6vyiji,t1_j6vxwl2
"This feels like trying to find the negatives tbh. Doherty leaving over Emerson- dohertys been terrible this season sk really who cares. To say it out weighs the positives of getting one of the most exciting rwbs in Europe is a stretch. 

Gil leaving instead of moura, neither are particularly great and are most likely stop gaps anyway. Gil didn't want to be here and do cameos off the bench whereas moura loves the club and is happy too. 

Max kilman we were never seriously linked with other than some random ITK on twitter. I wouldn't really be too disappointed with that as its probably not true. Is kilman even really thay good? Certainly not the steps uo that badtoni or Gvardiol or the other ones we were linked too are!",Spurs,Yes,j6w1vxf,t1_j6vuatr
"I do think it was a positive window. Transfers in will have more of an impact than what was lost. We‚Äôre not an oil club or owned by some war criminal, think we‚Äôve spent well and looking good for the summer (provided Kane and conte stay)",Spurs,Yes,j6vuq7r,t1_j6vuatr
"I think Lucas being back in training makes the decision easier, he was playing as a wing back in preseason and could play there if needed.",Spurs,Yes,j6w7qgs,t1_j6w6j7y

">Have you watched Deluefou for Udinese

Yes, mainly because of Udogie. And yes I have to admit he looks fantastic for them, but I just don't think his game would translate well into how we play this season.

Everything they do is quick, fast movements, counters, and he's the main man that everything goes through. In our system, where he wouldn't be able to hold on to the ball as much, and not have that time and space to create, because Conte wants manny passes around the box, without anyone having the ball at their feet for too long, I think his creativity would lack. Also, even though he's already had stints at Watford and Everton, I don't think he would have a fun time with his size and build.

Also, Danjuma is 2 years younger.",Spurs,Yes,j6wg3ub,t1_j6wfcjl

"Our friend below did a good job of answering, all I‚Äôd add is he basically expected to be starting every game, felt entitled to it, and constantly was fighting with Foden who plays on the same flank. 

Basically thought he was bigger than the team and Pep said ‚Äúokay, you‚Äôre out‚Äù. It‚Äôs the type of move that requires a lot of balls and that brings the team together. It will also usher Foden back into form as the other LBs don‚Äôt cut inside as much which allows them to play balls down the line rather than in through the middle where it gets crowded out.

Just really feels like one of those massive decisions s where you flog off one of the biggest players in the team for the benefit of the whole",Spurs,Yes,j6x4lh1,t1_j6x2sst
his wages are also going to be taxed at a much lower rate i believe. wouldn't surprise me if he took a reduction in pay and still made the same,Spurs,Yes,j6xjylf,t1_j6x8exj
Liked and retweeted a tweet in support of Greenwood essentially and then put out a tweet ‚Äòapologising‚Äô if you can call it that,Spurs,Yes,j6yzn2d,t1_j6yxxxy
Only way I could see us get Kilman without paying way over value is if Wolves are relegated,Spurs,Yes,j6z81ge,t1_j6z5qz7
WHAT,Spurs,Yes,j71gtwg,t1_j70htws
Booooooo,Spurs,Yes,j71jksw,t1_j70htws
throw Adele in there and we have a full TEAM! coys,Spurs,Yes,j6wh32w,t1_j6wcusk

"How are murderers convicted without victims testifying? 

UK police is filled with rapists. They didn't want to convict one of their own. Mendy, Partey, Greenwood, none of them will go to jail.

In a decent society we would if we stayed in position to the end of the season,Spurs,Yes,j6yioow,t1_j6yid8v
Ake is having a decent season. What happened to Laporte though? Him and Dias looked to be a great partnership.,Spurs,Yes,j6wcugl,t1_j6wc9gp
You don't bench a ¬£42m signing to spare someones feelings ..,Spurs,Yes,j6x3rt3,t1_j6wzpmq
Keita?,Spurs,Yes,j6ynbib,t1_j6ylajh
Liverpool still spends pretty big. They‚Äôre even considering going in for Bellingham who will be north of ¬£100mil,Spurs,Yes,j6ymmsc,t1_j6ylajh
And that‚Äôs fine. That‚Äôs how the club is currently run. Problem is most fans want trophies and unless you‚Äôre incredibly well run and lucky that takes spending a lot of money.,Spurs,Yes,j6zc470,t1_j6z8ppd
"Spot on there I think. We‚Äôve done pretty well bringing in versatile players for the front line, I think a good final piece would be a right winger he could double up as a CAM so we can switch formations. Kudus would be insane for this I think.",Spurs,Yes,j6w5qa7,t1_j6w5h0a
Do we not need to take into account that kulu seems to be our one source of creativity this year?,Spurs,Yes,j6w4fil,t1_j6w475y
He‚Äôd be so much fucking fun.,Spurs,Yes,j6w4s4b,t1_j6w49tc

POK agrees lmao",Spurs,Yes,j6wrf5z,t1_j6wohzw
"..and the further they push people away from their more extreme views, and more the 2 sides dislike eachother.

These people are literally fracturing our fanbase and hurting the club but they don't see it.",Spurs,Yes,j6xqhat,t1_j6xk97s
"I guess what i see is a lot of people who think we are vastly underperforming, but I don't quite understand where they think we should be? Not sure it's totally realistic to think we can be top2 every season when the Manchester clubs have vastly higher rev and Chelsea spend like drunker sailors.

Of course Enic/football department have made mistakes and every decision that hasn't worked out can easily be picked apart in hindsight, but they have also made a lot of good decisions and it seems we are about where we should be in terms of a club, but I really wanted to open this to a discussion as maybe my view is totally warped by what happened before Enic and maybe revenue is not the biggest determining factor of success?",Spurs,Yes,j6y5u9h,t1_j6y4q7i
"I don't know why I didn't think of that, haha, thank you that's what I was looking for.",Spurs,Yes,j6wy5kt,t1_j6wvusk
Do you know when they changed the match day?,Spurs,Yes,j6zp9se,t1_j6zkd4u
"Oh man, he really does, but I also think people need to appreciate how hard it is for a player to break into the first team. You have to be good enough to get noticed, both technically and physically, but thats not enough because we already have pretty much 2 internationals in every position so you need some luck to even get a run out in the first team, and you need a manager who both suits your strengths, but also has faith in you and will understand mistakes are part of the learning curve and not just bin you for not tracking a man that leads to a goal. But yeah, so many players look good at youth levels but just don‚Äôt have what it takes and end up in the lower leagues. But to be honest, a career in league football has to be considered a success, only the 0.01% of people that start make it to the top level.",Spurs,Yes,j6yngxf,t1_j6xxwlv
"and the fact that the only reason Gil played at all is Deki, Richy, Sonny and Lucas were all injured.

When all our forwards are fit Gil is literally 3rd choice at any position he could play",Spurs,Yes,j6y02lv,t1_j6xhry1
Can they put nicknames on their backs?,Spurs,Yes,j6ybrc2,t1_j6yb895
"Do you ever have any nuanced takes? Every player is either absolutely shit like Romero or Udogie or the best player in his position in world football like Dier or Kane. I've never seen you rank anyone anywhere in between. Lenglet is a perfect example of someone who has been bang average, not brilliant but not horrendous.",Spurs,Yes,j6whdkf,t1_j6wgdbs
Absolute shit is proper harsh. But to be sure I think the club will want someone better,Spurs,Yes,j6wgh6f,t1_j6wgdbs
What a moronic comment.  Again.,Spurs,Yes,j6wk838,t1_j6wgdbs
Hard agree the bloke is immobile and doesn‚Äôt make use of his excellent passing ability anywhere near enough to be worth using,Spurs,Yes,j6wswz7,t1_j6wgdbs
I'm also shopping via ticket resale sites and am happy to purchase them that way but I figured I'd pursue all avenues. Things come up in life that might prevent someone from going and I wasn't asking for discounted tickets.,Spurs,Yes,j6y4tzw,t1_j6y3mlf
Levy won't pay the wages,Spurs,Yes,j70prcv,t1_j6z4mc2
"Tbf there is not a much better exit for him. He will be playing in CL and fighting for La Liga title every season. Only few footballers could dream of, especially at his age. It ended abruptly yeah, but he is in a great position for the next few years if he impresses Simeone.",Spurs,Yes,j6w07jn,t1_j6vybb4
Didn't read + joke player + shit beard + Emerson clears,Spurs,Yes,j6vzig3,t1_j6vyn38
"Why are you using words like ""subpar"" and ""unspectacular""? He was TERRIBLE",Spurs,Yes,j6w0ggl,t1_j6vyiji
I 90% agree with your points but don't tell me you still hope we would sign anyone like Bastoni or Gvardiol. Let's accept the reality. Kilman is best of the rest which we should've signed and could've signed had we not left the negotiation till the last day.,Spurs,Yes,j6w2b2g,t1_j6w1vxf
"That's true but there's going to need to be some explanation as to why the budget was so low (reported to be ¬£30M at the start of the window, we end up going for 2 loans, one that'll end up around ¬£40M and the other that probably won't be bought out, after having a full season of games and events at the stadium and with leftover money from the summer injection (not 100% confirmed where that money went, maybe they'll come out and say this isn't the case). 

Obviously we don't need to spend money just to spend money, especially if none of our top targets are available, but we didn't get a Kulusevski backup nor a CB and got Danjuma because he was cheap. Extremely concerning if our last summer was just an anomaly and instead this approach continues into future windows",Spurs,Yes,j6vwqch,t1_j6vuq7r
Yeah that‚Äôs on Paratici lmao,Spurs,Yes,j6wd4aw,t1_j6wd16v
"Paid off, gaslit, whatever -- it all amounts to the same thing, we all lose",Spurs,Yes,j6xft8z,t1_j6xamg7
"Yeah, tbf at least they conducted themselves pretty well up until now and suspended him while under investigation, as opposed to some other teams.",Spurs,Yes,j6x2mzy,t1_j6x20zn
You‚Äôd hope so but football doesn‚Äôt have a good track record for this type of situation,Spurs,Yes,j6x2fdz,t1_j6x28do
Could use all the help we can get,Spurs,Yes,j6x2cun,t1_j6wh5fv
Delofe would be amazing,Spurs,Yes,j6wvfbz,t1_j6wujz9
Which player? Delle Allifeu?,Spurs,Yes,j6x26la,t1_j6wujz9
"I think he‚Äôd get a lot of the ball in our system given how Conte wants his wingers to drop back deep to collect the ball and turn to spray it out wide. He would do that job perfectly

He‚Äôs also very evasive and uses his size to his advantage",Spurs,Yes,j6wggq0,t1_j6wg3ub
"A decent bit. I know Deulefwou cuz I watch Udinese for Udogie

No I do not but I know Doekhi. Spurs played his former team Vitesse in the UECL and he got sent off in Conte‚Äôs first ever match for us which happened to be a wild ride cuz Romero also got sent off from our side",Spurs,Yes,j6wi6d1,t1_j6wh8s4
He can play but he plays on he left for Udinese. He would start ahead of Son given how creative he is,Spurs,Yes,j6wfvwy,t1_j6wfr5g
"I‚Äôm not saying sessegnon has been better than perisic, but if you think it‚Äôs coming down to a 23 year old English LB and a 34 year old Croatian LB for the 25th spot you know who Levy is picking 11 out of 10 times. I could be wrong but even Conte hasn‚Äôt clearly favored one over the other this season. I think all three are probably on the team next season with perisic serving as a forward more often when needed and an offensive LWB substitute.",Spurs,Yes,j6w3060,t1_j6w2lzq
Udogie needs to be loaned out for another 2 seasons atleast. He‚Äôs extremely raw and very very undeveloped,Spurs,Yes,j6w2zei,t1_j6w2lzq
"You got his shirt already? Lol madlad, hope it‚Äôs a good luck charm.",Spurs,Yes,j6yaq02,t1_j6y1vvr
I always think it's odd when players go with a P. Porro or Pedro P. especially when there's not another player that they'd need to do that for. So it would be funny if he just went for the double abbreviation. Shirt sales would be through the roof,Spurs,Yes,j6xo5j3,t1_j6xm2hy
"can't see his philosophy and personality being a fit at Bayern, and would he be interested in cakewalking the BL? not sure. 

who knows with Boehly-Boy, but seems like Potter will get time",Spurs,Yes,j6ym3iw,t1_j6yhxkj
Nah it was beyond funny seeing the team we scored against just look embarrassed with Sandstrom blasting in an empty stadium,Spurs,Yes,j6y70yd,t1_j6y6qct
"You're probably right, although I thought I read somewhere that Wolves were considering selling him",Spurs,Yes,j6z8y12,t1_j6z81ge
"Adele has proper no-nonsense CDM vibes, can fill in at CB if there's injuries",Spurs,Yes,j6ws74g,t1_j6wh32w
"Because murders are much easier to prove than domestic violence?

Mate don‚Äôt have a go at me, I‚Äôm in complete agreeance that all of them should be in prison. Just stating why the case was dropped.",Spurs,Yes,j6x6kk1,t1_j6x6ekk
Squad management is a big thing in football what are you on about. Also Emerson knows the system and has already proven he can handle city,Spurs,No,j6x42d3,t1_j6x3rt3
"They've had the odd miss but that golden period of theirs Mane/salah/vvd/alison/robertson/wijnaldum

That's just so good. It's not just like Hits, it's like the best player in the league in that position.",Spurs,Yes,j6yo7qd,t1_j6ynbib
"actually considering they are better at selling (See Ndombele flop) they have not spent much more than us over the past decade in net spend, that is skewed a little bit due to them being able to cash in on the Neymar transfer when they sold Coutinho for 150m to barca

In fact according to transfermarakt we have outspent them [https://www.transfermarkt.us/premier-league/fuenfjahresvergleich/wettbewerb/GB1](https://www.transfermarkt.us/premier-league/fuenfjahresvergleich/wettbewerb/GB1)",Spurs,Yes,j6yobds,t1_j6ymmsc
"But then we'd be better with more creativity in a different position.  A creative midfielder and a fast winger gives the option to lean into either option when the squad is in strength.

eg, imagine Chiesa and Maddison.   Seems unlikely both would want to be in a rotation, but that would be amazing.",Spurs,Yes,j6wab36,t1_j6w4fil
This,Spurs,Yes,j6w4kg1,t1_j6w4fil
Why,Spurs,Yes,j736aa7,t1_j6wjnqy
[It seems that it was changed back in December.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-city-fixtures-tv-tottenham-25677318) I'm sorry about your situation.,Spurs,Yes,j6zx22g,t1_j6zp9se
"Yeah exactly. It wasn't becuase he'd been integrated to the team, he played cos there was noone else, and he left because he didn't want to only play when everyone else was injured",Spurs,Yes,j6y0exa,t1_j6y02lv
"Yeah, that's not unheard of. 

Another one would be Gedson Fernandes had Gedson on the back of his shirt",Spurs,Yes,j6yd2r6,t1_j6ybrc2
"üòÇüòÇüòÇ I give my justifications so my takes are nothing but nuanced

Bang average would be a good way to describe Lenglet if he wasn‚Äôt directly at fault for 2 goals. His on the ball skills are lacking too. A great passer for sure but when put under pressure crumbles the fastest

He isn‚Äôt good enough for us",Spurs,Yes,j6wi152,t1_j6whdkf
"He's on around 160k right? Doesn't seem undoable to me, but maybe a little high for a backup",Spurs,Yes,j70qi5u,t1_j70prcv
Atletico aren‚Äôt even playing europa league. He signed a 5 month contract.,Spurs,Yes,j6w16on,t1_j6w07jn
Someone just + really dislikes + a player + other people + seemed to like,Spurs,Yes,j6w14o4,t1_j6vzig3
Emerson is way worse,Spurs,Yes,j6w9pdx,t1_j6vzig3
"Sure, he was TERRIBLE, at times. It's not that I'm not willing to admit that, I'm just trying to shine him in a more positive light",Spurs,Yes,j6w13fb,t1_j6w0ggl
"As I say all this kilman stuff is just based off ITK, has anywhere reputable reported we went for him at all let alone left it to the last day? 

I think hes solid but there are better LCB out there. For example if Hincapie can keep developing this next 6 months he could over take him, also I still think Bastoni there's a shot if conte stays given how screwed inter are. Bastoni still hasn't signed a new contract",Spurs,Yes,j6w2kis,t1_j6w2b2g
"Tbf to the club we have a manager who won't commit to the club past summer and has openly spoken about how hard it is to spend time away from his family. Would be a bit wild to drop 100m on his players in Jan.

Not to mention Lpool, Newcastle, City all spent the same as us if not less. It looks like our budget was pretty normal tbh as opposed to worryingly low. Chelsea kbvs went mad byt they're Chelsea. And arsenal only spent an extra 10m or so. I know they were throwing around big offers but were they very really going to get thise players? Twice they offered well below the asking price and got repeatedly rejected.",Spurs,Yes,j6w29c9,t1_j6vwqch
"I mean, i get that you mean ""we"" in the societal sense, but she's the one that loses. It takes on average something like 6 attempts to leave an abusive relationship. And this isn't just run of the mill abuse. She's been raped and beaten. 

She's still the victim, we aren;t",Spurs,Yes,j6xismb,t1_j6xft8z
He‚Äôs done in the top leagues but there‚Äôs no doubt the likes of the Turkish league or Saudi leagues would take him with open arms,Spurs,Yes,j6x6tth,t1_j6x2fdz
And they got their keeper sent off as well.,Spurs,Yes,j6wry8i,t1_j6wi6d1
Totally disagree. He‚Äôs been a standout player on a decent Serie A team.,Spurs,Yes,j6w3nhh,t1_j6w2zei
Was him or Bentancur but i thought fuck it!,Spurs,Yes,j6ydu8l,t1_j6yaq02
Really? That's a great option for us then,Spurs,Yes,j6z9te8,t1_j6z8y12
He's on fucking audio. There's a victim with injuries. He violated the law by trying to visit her after being arrested. This is the SA equivalent of a murder case with 1080p video. It's a joke,Spurs,Yes,j6x6ugx,t1_j6x6kk1
and Conte has shown he will start an average player that follows the system every time.,Spurs,Yes,j6xjrsw,t1_j6x42d3
Skewed a lot a bit by coutinho,Spurs,Yes,j6yoqzj,t1_j6yobds
That‚Äôs really cool.  Imagining Jordan with the nickname ‚ÄúAir‚Äù on his back would‚Äôve been so dope.,Spurs,Yes,j6yd7rq,t1_j6yd2r6
So just because he made 2 mistake he instantly turns from bang average to shit?,Spurs,Yes,j6wl0fu,t1_j6wi152
"He earns close to kane iirc. Too steep for someone with very limited contribution(lack of g/a, weak mentality, more suited to a possession based side)",Spurs,Yes,j70wa3r,t1_j70qi5u
Yeah that‚Äôs why I said he has to impress so he could get a new contract.,Spurs,Yes,j6w2rsl,t1_j6w16on
Because + he's + incredibly + incredibly + incredibly + shit,Spurs,Yes,j6w1em4,t1_j6w14o4
"No, not at times. As a whole",Spurs,Yes,j6w1cju,t1_j6w13fb
"I straight up hate Bastoni at this point so even if there is a chance, I don't really care about him.    Hincapie is one to monitor for sure but he's too short to plug our aerial weaknesses.",Spurs,Yes,j6w3xwa,t1_j6w2kis
"Yeah, obviously not downplaying her experience, just underlining that the victim not getting the justice she deserves harms all of us in the long run",Spurs,Yes,j6xjcdu,t1_j6xismb
"Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure, at his age/talent level I really wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if a top 5 league team took a punt on him",Spurs,Yes,j6x7cb9,t1_j6x6tth
if they were taking bets i'd put everything I have that he'll end up in the Turkish league. It's probably the best league that has zero qualms about rapists playing in it.,Spurs,Yes,j6xjgro,t1_j6x6tth
"Have you watched them regularly? Cuz I have. And he‚Äôs been anything but stand out. He doesn‚Äôt track back, he switches off multiple times a game, doesn‚Äôt have the technical ability to cross, very predictable - cutting inside all the time.

At the moment he‚Äôs a one trick pony in that he can only get in behind. Still needs to develop almost every single aspect of his game",Spurs,Yes,j6w3t2b,t1_j6w3nhh
"Like I said, I agree with you. The justice systems around the world do not work effectively",Spurs,Yes,j6x6zzp,t1_j6x6ugx
"i mentioned that but the narrative that we spend vastly less than Liverpool simply isn't true.

also FSG don't just pump money into liverpool, all money they spend is in the form of repayable loans, this includes the improvements to the stadium, we are run very similar to them",Spurs,Yes,j6yq9gh,t1_j6yoqzj
Well yeah but that was a bussiness decision by them. He was one of their best players and they sold him to buy VVD and Allison. That's just great bussiness from them.,Spurs,Yes,j6yp0bt,t1_j6yoqzj
Sorry but that last mistake was fucking crap. Do you not remember Mahrez? Is that the kind of guy you would describe as bang average?,Spurs,Yes,j6wl4dn,t1_j6wl0fu
What has he actually done to be valued as better than that though?,Spurs,Yes,j6wtpy7,t1_j6wl0fu
"It‚Äôs okay at least he‚Äôs gone and you won‚Äôt have to see him at spurs again, hope you can handle 3 more days of a light Doherty Circlejerk until we play city and the sub will move onto how we either played like shit in a loss or if we get a result how we handed the title to arsenal. Think you can manage :)",Spurs,Yes,j6w1y9q,t1_j6w1em4
Got it üëç,Spurs,Yes,j6w1kw0,t1_j6w1cju
"absolutely, i just wanted to make sure people weren't reading this as disparaging her. the lasting impact this fuckface is going to make on her life is depressing. 

he might not be going to prison now, but something tells me he'll end up there one way or another eventually. you don't abuse and rape like that and just stop without doing some serious fixing.",Spurs,Yes,j6xkxb7,t1_j6xjcdu
"England -- No

Germany -- No

Spain -- No

France - Unlikely

Italy -- Maybe

Who knows though",Spurs,Yes,j6xfbiv,t1_j6x7cb9
"It does seem the most likely

Loads of balkan clubs who would take him I'm sure as well. Russia obviously couldn't give two fucks about rights of any kind",Spurs,Yes,j6xkbhy,t1_j6xjgro
So one trick pony like both of our LBs currently. Perisic is basically a cross merchant who can‚Äôt defend while Sess‚Ä¶ not even sure what he does well atm,Spurs,Yes,j6w4uzu,t1_j6w3t2b
"He‚Äôs 20 years old. Of course he has flaws and improvement areas needed in his game id be shocked if he didn‚Äôt. 

Name another defender at that age who has zero flaws to their game and you‚Äôll struggle. As long as they are learning and improving that is all that matters at his age ‚Äî he‚Äôs showing immense promise and hopefully will be a future fullback with Porro.",Spurs,Yes,j6w72oq,t1_j6w3t2b
Think there‚Äôs just a different scale with Liverpool. When they identify targets they get them no matter the price point. We don‚Äôt operate like that,Spurs,Yes,j6yqtyl,t1_j6yq9gh
"Yes, because bang average players make mistakes sometimes. That's why they're not brilliant.",Spurs,Yes,j6wlbad,t1_j6wl4dn
"Going by the same logic, scored in the UCL to get us out of the group.",Spurs,Yes,j6wudi1,t1_j6wtpy7
No I want everyone to be happy he's gone too,Spurs,Yes,j6w52in,t1_j6w1y9q
Took its time to sink in,Spurs,Yes,j6w1maq,t1_j6w1kw0
"whatever happens to him, I hope the cunt rots",Spurs,Yes,j6xgi5s,t1_j6xfbiv
"Perisic‚Äôs one trick is very important to our play style plus he executes it to perfection so getting one trick ponies who can do exactly what he can is beneficial to us

Udogie‚Äôs trick is off ball stuff whereas our WB‚Äôs need to create with the ball so Udogie is the wrong fit",Spurs,Yes,j6w6ool,t1_j6w4uzu
I literally started by saying he needs 2 more loans. He will be good for us in the future if he develops and that can only happen with play time,Spurs,Yes,j6w7g65,t1_j6w72oq
Scared money don't make money,Spurs,Yes,j70e6aj,t1_j6yqtyl
"If you make a mistake every time you‚Äôre pressured you don‚Äôt classify as bang average. Just because you don‚Äôt concede a goal every time you make a mistake doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt a mistake

Lenglet isn‚Äôt the least bit press resistant like I said. Even a little bit of pressure and that‚Äôs a possession turn over from his side",Spurs,Yes,j6wmbmr,t1_j6wlbad
"Ah yes the best metric to judge a central defender by, goal(s)",Spurs,Yes,j6wug6l,t1_j6wudi1
So this is what you do with your time. Complain people liked Matt Doherty,Spurs,Yes,j6x5dld,t1_j6w1maq
"Could do worse things - for instance, liking Matt Doherty",Spurs,Yes,j6x5wk4,t1_j6x5dld
Conte has had a pretty shit few months hasnt he,Spurs,No,j6rgqlx,t3_10qm4bu
"Maybe I‚Äôm a bit salty here but I think Chelsea are digging their own grave by signing so many over-priced players with an enormous wage.

"Emergod continues his unstoppable reign at the top. Try to stop him, try to even look at him the wrong way -- you will just be another meaningless peon crushed by the force of a thousand no-look passes.",Spurs,No,j6srcmi,t3_10qm4bu
"Laughing so much at imagining Ali trying to record this video.

Watching the behind the scenes of the Pedro Porro media announcement video on the Spurs app you can tell that Sergio Reguil√≥n and Pedro Porro would‚Äôve got along real well!! Porro seems so chuffed to make the move to the premier league and play for our club I‚Äôm really excited for him and I can‚Äôt wait to see Porro make his debut for Spurs!!,Spurs,No,j6r4gn5,t3_10qm4bu

Liverpool fans: ""Jesus, our club is run by amateurs. Just look at last few months. Owners are trying to sell out, but can't do it. Our team has collapsed to 9th, our midfield is old and has collapsed, our defenders are a shadow of who they were - and all we add is another attacker.""  
Chelsea fans: ""Jesus, our club is run by amateurs. Just look at this transfer window. Throwing money around to make us an easily ridiculed by everyone, and topping it by selling our starting DM/playmaker to league rivals.""  
ManU fans: ""Jesus, our club is run by amateurs. Our stadium is falling apart, they're stealing hundreds of millions from the club chest directly into their own bank accounts.""  
ManC fans: ""Jesus, our club is run by amateurs. We're falling behind Arsenal, have plenty of money. But our biggest business is sending out Cancelo, the player who's been perhaps the best fullback and also midfielder over the last few seasons.""

"Where does 4 weeks recovery time come from? Is this because the physical and psychological toll that is Tottenham Hotspur requires more recovery time?

"I think it'll be pretty straightforward we know they've already identified the targets. 

At a guess it will be 

In

HG Gk in (raya/pickford/hendo)

LCB- Bastoni/Kilman/hincapie

CCB (also covers rcb) - no idea on this one tbh.

Another attacker if Danjuma doesn't stay. 

Out

Sanchez, maybe sess, and then all the loan army (regi Glc ndombele winks)

"Prem league wages. Why would a player like Ndombele accept a lower wage to play in Italy when he can just be loaned out to play in Italy and still get Kane wages. 

They have all the leverage because the club is desperate to get rid of them. So even a loan/termination works. The player still gets his contract money and gets to play football. Its a win win for them to refuse any transfers and force a loan/termination",Spurs,Yes,j6s0cv1,t1_j6qwgij
"Normally we put a ridiculous fee on their head that European clubs can't afford. We turned down permanent sales for Ndombele and Lo Celso in the summer.

"I don't think people are actually upset about the money that we missed out on. I think it's about letting him go like that all of a sudden on deadline day because of a technicality. 

And he was of course very likeable, plus add to the fact that we all wanted him to play instead of Emerson, and even though he has a bigger audience for future sales due to his age, everyone wanted to see Emerson's back, not Doherty's.

Plus add to the fact that he was best mates with Harry and Dier.

And then, there is of course the post-match interview  he did last year after one of our wins where the journalist asked him something along the lines of do you see yourself leaving any time soon, to which he replied: ""Why would I want to be anywhere besides Tottenham?""

I think people on the sub are frustrated by the combination of the above named circumstances, not the potential money we could've gotten for him.",Spurs,Yes,j6r5w50,t1_j6r4tin
"I liked him very much, seems to be a really nice bloke. His actual spell at RWB was very good, shame it lasted so short. Is it best for both parties?

"I mean he's only just 31, we might as well be accurate.

I don't think we know about the situation yet to respond either way, but terminating contracts is pretty unusual (I can only recall doing this with Aurier in recent years) and suggests a lack of proper planning or joined up thinking. It's not so much about Doherty as an individual - we'd need to shift him sooner or later - it's just indicative of usual activity, which could be fine, but without knowing the circumstances that brought it about (and I doubt we ever will) I think it's pretty normal for fans to raise an eyebrow.",Spurs,Yes,j6r7809,t1_j6r4tin
"How can anyone not moan about selling the 2nd best WB at the club after Perisic (before Porro) and keeping an actual amateur who offers nothing offensively as backup to our extremely attack minded RWB?

"We improved our first eleven by a lot, how often do people think that happens in January?",Spurs,Yes,j6sgmmt,t1_j6sg9m9
Still think that not addressing CB was a mistake. I‚Äôd say around a 5 or 6 out of 10. Could always end up being better if Porro completely changes how the squad plays,Spurs,Yes,j6skp95,t1_j6sg9m9
In a way. We have so much deadwood (like the Doherty debacle proved) that getting the unquestionable correct players in is better than going for gambles. Like #1 RWB target is much better than settling for whatever cb we could get a deal for,Spurs,Yes,j6sgvwg,t1_j6sg9m9
"For now, yeah. Time will tell if not getting a CB is going to cost us or not.",Spurs,Yes,j6sloju,t1_j6sg9m9

"It's precisely why I think it's bullshit that people bludgeon Kane with the ""no trophies"" garbage incessantly.  Kane is one of the greatest footballers of all time - regardless of whether his team has won trophies in knockout tournaments.

World Cup Golden Boot Winner. 

National Team Captain. 

Spurs All-Time Goal Scorer. 

England National Team All-Time Goal Scorer. 

Likely to become Premier League All-Time Goal Scorer. 

Won Golden Boot AND Playmaker Award in Same Season.

If you want to reflexively call everything they do stupid, I get it, but in this case I don't really see the issue. Doherty is probably worth less than his wages if we're stuck with him and isn't a long-term keeper.

Having said all of that, I still can't believe we left so much business for the end and only brought in 2. Should've just paid the release clause for Porro. All of this about their league cup game, I don't believe it. No one cares about that trophy. It doesn't qualify you for Europe or anything.",Spurs,Yes,j6t8e08,t1_j6soijl

"I don't know why you're getting downvoted; fair question even if your position is pretty much straight down the middle for this sub.  


I do think this would be the summer to finally start moving players on who aren't going to make it to the level required - definitely Tanganga and Sessegnon, possibly Gil (though I still think he's worth keeping attached to the organization, either via loan or a favorable buy-back clause), and (unfortunately) send Lloris to play with all the other dogs at ~~that nice farm upstate~~ in Nice.

Like, if someone got banned for dodgy dealings in any sector or industry, would you want to enter into dealings with them? I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with it.

Not for me it wasn't. I didn't think either Doherty or Emerson were complete liabilities. Sure, they should be upgraded, but that was never our main problem.

We may have some problems in an attacking sense from the RWBs, but they weren't singlehandedly costing us games.

Again, we have problems going forward, but we still have great attacking numbers and options.

Now, look at teams like Man Utd and Newcastle. They aren't prolific goalscoring teams, but have a great defensive structure with their new signings and their results are better for it.

"You're right, it's just expectations are on the floor in general so it's easy to say he can defend. On top of that he's likeable to some folks so there's that 

I do wish him all the best and wanna keep him but I dont see him upping his game immensely in the near future, probably he'll have some game time when we steamroll or PP got injured

Doc is gonna be sorely missed is my gut feeling, goddamnit what a stupid deal",Spurs,Yes,j6rjukv,t1_j6rifk3

"Our defenders can be coached to do a good enough job to fit the system, we've seen that last year. I'm not sure what happened this year, whether Lloris shitting the bed had a domino effect on the entire backline, or whether the coaching has not been up to par, but even a good defender like Romero who has been solid for Argentina has had plenty of bozo moments for us.

Or just some investors who we've got heavily linked with in the press were shown around the training ground several times and the players saw/met them. And, you know, matt doherty is a player and has eyes and ears and a mouth so would be aware of it and talk about it. 

And BTW Joe Lewis daughter is going to inherit all her dad's portfolio when he dies/steps back, the paperwork for it has already begun, and she will be the new owner, probably withing 12 months. So yeah I'd imagine she's pretty clued up on stuff. And she's a family friend of the Kanes.

">Our defenders can be coached to do a good enough job to fit the system

The problem this season is that we are trying to press high. Last season we kept compact in a mid/lower block and had some incredible counters, but struggled to create against low-blocks, but that was a lot better than this season.

The pressing this season is highlighting our lack of individual quality at the back. And it's not only the CBs who panic when isolated. Sess and Perisic aren't able to deal with 1v1s.

>Romero who has been solid for Argentina has had plenty of bozo moments for us.

Especially a business that operates heavily in player loan deals. I personally am highly skeptical of these suggested ""facts"" and lean to believe this was a result of calculated moves elsewhere to make everything work. Besides, like it or not, Doherty is the wrong side of 30 with history of a serious knee injury, and was third choice. This is called making a difficult, correct decision.
