Secondly, I will be in London the weekend of February the 24th through the 27th during which Tottenham will play Chelsea at home. I don't want to make another post over how to buy tickets as a foreigner (I've read previous posts and understand how to do so) so just want to clarify some things before I proceed.  
  
I wanted to see if anyone could clarify for me that if I purchase a One Hotspur membership today what my chances of securing a ticket through Ticket Exchange for the game against Chelsea would be. I understand that on the website it says that tickets are sold out (I just saw this today) but this will likely my only chance in the near future to watch a Tottenham home game live.  
  
I hope this question is not annoying or a repeat of what others have asked in the past but I would seriously appreciate some guidance, as if it is still possible for me to attend this game I would purchase the One Hotspur membership today but just don't want to spend the money without more guidance for a single weekend I will be in London.

Throw Porro straight in at RWB, and let's see what he can do with more attacking responsibility. Kane can stay forward as Conte wants, and maybe with Kulu playing centrally we can revitalise Son a bit running in behind to get on the end of his passes.

Spurs shutting out City? YES!",Spurs,Yes,j7cdl15,t1_j7c5pct
All talk of a generous run is just fluff. It's literally just short of half the season to go,Spurs,Yes,j7cc7n2,t1_j7c94fv
"I think united and newcastle are gonna drop into 5th and 6th, we could get top 4 if we go on a run, hell maybe we could finish 3rd.

 I wouldnt be suprised if chelsea sneak in to top 4 or a europe spot as well bc brighton and fulham are gonna start dropping points soon and go into midtable",Spurs,Yes,j7c9xsv,t1_j7c94fv
"fr, we can't really afford to care about who wins the title. we need top 4, competition is tough, we need every point we can get.",Spurs,Yes,j7a72kn,t1_j7a2gqm
"I want to win, but I won’t be as annoyed as I usually am if we lose",Spurs,Yes,j7a8l5q,t1_j7a2gqm

"Hey man! If you want a bit of a referesher, feel free to check out [the guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/tn7xfw/the_ultimate_guide_to_visiting_tottenham/) I posted about visiting Tottenham.

Run it up!,Spurs,Yes,j7cgioj,t1_j7alvr1
he is such a versatile player it's amazing. can't be anywhere near as dim as he comes off to have such a high pitch IQ,Spurs,Yes,j7byhiz,t1_j7brdkr
They had fucking Ramon Vega saying it on the radio lol,Spurs,Yes,j7ddyf3,t1_j7da5wr
"50/50

POK has Royal starting and i'm inclined to agree",Spurs,Yes,j7a8owj,t1_j7a8dd9
"I think it's extra unlikely we switch anything up considering conte isn't even around. 

Excited for a cheeky Porro cameo at the end though.",Spurs,Yes,j7a8k4e,t1_j7a8dd9
"If it was against a lower league team yeah, but against city, it's not going to happen I think",Spurs,Yes,j7ab147,t1_j7a8dd9
"Originally I thought no chance, but since Stellini is in charge now instead of Conte so maybe 50/50",Spurs,Yes,j7a8xmh,t1_j7a8dd9
I don't think he starts.,Spurs,Yes,j7a8u4c,t1_j7a8dd9
I'd expect not,Spurs,Yes,j7b6brw,t1_j7a8dd9
EMERSON MASTERCLASS,Spurs,Yes,j7c2klu,t1_j7c25kb
Yep. Best footballing weekend in such a long time. And you’ll get Kyrie on top of it??,Spurs,Yes,j7c6hs9,t1_j7c504q
Casemiro red was pretty soft.,Spurs,Yes,j7c8z6e,t1_j7c504q
"Can't help you with any concrete advice since I'm also foreign and have never been to a game, but my only suggestion would be posting this tomorrow earlier in the day. Not many people check the daily discussion at 11pm because, well because it's the end of the day. Plus after that match all everyone wants to talk about is Emerson/Kane.",Spurs,Yes,j7d7tjw,t1_j7ccw37
as in doing well?,Spurs,Yes,j7cx0cp,t1_j7cvrl5
They're still upset martial was sent off for slapping Lamela any time that incident comes up,Spurs,Yes,j7arsst,t1_j7apmyg
"My united fan mates argument was essentially ""yeah but casemiro got hit In the melee as well"" as if all players don't know the moment you raise your hands you're having an early shower",Spurs,Yes,j7apui0,t1_j7apmyg
Some of the world's most deluded fans created and molded by Howard Webb. I stg he carried Man United out of relegation battle for so long.,Spurs,Yes,j7axj85,t1_j7apmyg
"I don't think his commitment has every been questioned. This was a great match for him - he's solid defensively, fast on the break and can play simple passes. In a counter-attacking match like that, the opposition team play directly to his strengths. I don't think there's any coincidence that his best matches this season have come against City.

Hopefully he can take confidence from matches like that and we can play to his strengths when he's on the pitch. Between him and Porro we may be able to cover both sides of a wingback's roles, depending on what suits the match better.",Spurs,Yes,j7cd3n9,t1_j7cb93g
"Just thinking exactly the same. Fucking love Spurs and Harry so much. I cannot understand why the guy gets any stick from other fans. He’s an incredible player for club and country, one of the best in recent history. Most importantly though he’s a genuine, humble, kind and decent guy and an awesome role model for young kids.",Spurs,Yes,j7ckbj0,t1_j7chyia
meee :’D,Spurs,Yes,j7d1rhj,t1_j7chyia
any video for it? haha,Spurs,Yes,j7cb1ny,t1_j7c9mbv
"Our pressing really has started actually getting quite good. It's obvious we've been practicing it, and we're pretty terrible at it at the start of the season. 

It can be hit and miss but its actually starting to be quite effective now.",Spurs,Yes,j7d55ig,t1_j7cav5g
"As someone who went to school during the peak Wenger years, yeah it sucked. I wasn't pathetic enough to ever want us to lose though. Also, do these people still go to school or what?",Spurs,Yes,j7c712g,t1_j7c5yj1
Stellini you mean,Spurs,Yes,j7ceqen,t1_j7ce4x2
they should be more clinical in attack. twice now gnonto has created big chance and both have been missed due to lack of concentration/bad touches.,Spurs,Yes,j7b8hx1,t1_j7b61kd
"That one counter with Son driving ahead, it was Romero and Kane making the goalscoring run.",Spurs,Yes,j7c6xnv,t1_j7c0yyu
Adding in Hugo as well,Spurs,Yes,j7c4gtx,t1_j7c3uw6
">None of that draw bullshit which helps no one

TIL, points don't help anyone...",Spurs,Yes,j7a7pmu,t1_j7a5rbk
Man City won the league by one point in the 18/19 season (98) to Liverpool’s 97. But yeah I guess that one point from a draw means nothing,Spurs,Yes,j7aemss,t1_j7a5rbk
He had a great game today but a LOT of mistakes have crept into his game recently. He's a good keeper but not been better than Donnarumma,Spurs,Yes,j7bskbe,t1_j7b9adw
"Lack of conte time would be a factor, I imagine",Spurs,Yes,j7agfde,t1_j7af70z
"Emerson hits his form of his life, I bet that he has never played this well before. Pedro Porro walking into this starting 11 might've had something to do with it.",Spurs,Yes,j7akz5f,t1_j7af70z
"Spence because they have no RBs. Cancelo is a better comparison - but really Conte just doesn't work like this, that's the real reason if he doesn't start today. 

Casemiro didn't start for ages at United iirc",Spurs,Yes,j7b65jb,t1_j7af70z
No... We don't want new manager bounce for Milan. 1:0 Inter is enough.,Spurs,Yes,j7ceqau,t1_j7cdezu
"Even if they get a cash injection there’s no way they can afford Conte and his signings

Conte’s going nowhere",Spurs,Yes,j7cervy,t1_j7cdezu
Yeah exactly. I want us to win but it won't be as annoying if we lose as it usually would. People actually hoping we lose from the off are mad.,Spurs,Yes,j7an3pq,t1_j7ady0q
"That's the thing. If you're supporting a team, you should always want them to win.

_If_ we lose then helping city against arsenal is something we should take as a positive from the game, but it's not something we should be actively cheering for before the game.",Spurs,Yes,j7alp5p,t1_j7ady0q
They're probably already down the pub - luckily they don't need a booking for a table of under 6.,Spurs,Yes,j7aqazq,t1_j7aq6o7
What was the point of an 11am protest? Who's there to see it,Spurs,Yes,j7b4zrf,t1_j7aq6o7
I don't know if I want to see Perisic vs Mahrez round 2. Would probably prefer Sess to start,Spurs,Yes,j7aufdr,t1_j7auaj9
Perisic??,Spurs,Yes,j7auto3,t1_j7auaj9
I’d rather see Emerson on the left before Perisic against Mahrez again,Spurs,Yes,j7awrc6,t1_j7auaj9
He did a lot more than get fouled today to be fair.,Spurs,Yes,j7c7ax9,t1_j7c6pts
Grealish would've been incredible with Poch,Spurs,Yes,j7cjmnn,t1_j7c6pts
"Nothing in particular, but all over the pitch we just played better. More desire to win aerials, 2nd balls, making runs.

It's like we had 2nd half Spurs for the whole game, and it was glorious.",Spurs,Yes,j7dgret,t1_j7csif3
Poll: Would you like a separate sub for all the weirdos who can't stop whinging about Arsenal all the time? Y or N.,Spurs,Yes,j7dhxuw,t1_j7dgce7
Is he suspended for a second yellow? I thought it was only straight reds that carry additional suspensions,Spurs,Yes,j7c5ir1,t1_j7c3wg3
Is it from the montage of his celebration that Spurs had up on the big screens?,Spurs,Yes,j7cd8ma,t1_j7c991r
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,Spurs,Yes,j7aw5m8,t1_j7av2ge
"I want us to win every game we can, especially today, obviously, but I’d rather we finish 5th and they finish 2nd.",Spurs,Yes,j7b28ag,t1_j7avf6r
Locals will always have a different perspective. I have a lot of gooner mates.. god forbid they win the league.,Spurs,Yes,j7aznee,t1_j7avf6r
Plastics try to understand what a rivalry is challenge,Spurs,Yes,j7b1jjf,t1_j7avf6r
"Everything but Arse winning the league. If it requires us to take the L today, so be it. It works both ways you know, just like City aren't out of the title race if they lose today, we aren't out of top 4 race either.",Spurs,Yes,j7bemou,t1_j7avf6r
"Kvicha wouldn't work for us, the reason he's so good for Napoli is because he's starting for them every game, for us he'd be a benchwarmer who only gets 10-15 minutes per game once Conte finally subs Son off. Not getting KMJ is a criminal mistake tho, and I'm afraid the chance to sign him is gone for good. He will go to a better club in summer, or simply stay at Napoli where he has a good chance for another scudetto next year.",Spurs,Yes,j7beazm,t1_j7b2699
We didn't have Emerzinho.,Spurs,Yes,j7c7lpp,t1_j7c7axu
"I genuinely think both city and arse will start dropping more points more regularly. Its a long long season and as we showed today and Everton even more so yesterday, if you sit in and be compact it's harder and harder to break teams down as energy levels fall and fall",Spurs,Yes,j7cq8ww,t1_j7clnmo
"Literally thought about it yesterday when I watched him against Roma. Wanted to suggest it here, but I thought I'd get laughed at because people don't know him. He was also on bayern's shortlist for this January.",Spurs,Yes,j7af3fy,t1_j7ab9uu
"I know nothing about the guy. 

Where does he excel/what are his deficiencies?",Spurs,Yes,j7aingw,t1_j7ab9uu
I was taking a shit and missed it. love him and admire him so much.,Spurs,Yes,j7by8rp,t1_j7bwz4g
No.,Spurs,Yes,j7cfhoe,t1_j7c77dy
2-1 is a bit generous for City that kfc club eh? I reckon 4-0 for us with Porro bagging a hat trick is more realistic,Spurs,Yes,j7ao1up,t1_j7amhz2
Wonder why,Spurs,Yes,j7b1okh,t1_j7b0ubz
"Our biggest transfer expenditure ever was this year, after securing top 4",Spurs,Yes,j7b2yqj,t1_j7b0ubz
😂😂😂😂,Spurs,Yes,j7b3ejr,t1_j7b0ubz
"Bro that is just sad and some p\*ssy shit. Winners focus on winning and losers focus on winners. Spurs need to get 4th. 

Ya fuck arsenal, but if they get first that should be a bigger motivation for us next season. We want CL and need 4th.",Spurs,Yes,j7bi8qd,t1_j7bgjsy
"We have one of the easiest calendars on the league for the rest of the season, wouldn’t mind City beating us today.",Spurs,Yes,j7bkvwy,t1_j7bgjsy
"I don't know if Kulusevski would be as creative there as he is in his current position. Maybe he would, I'd just be wary of thinking he would based on how he plays in a different position.",Spurs,Yes,j7b60uj,t1_j7afs40
"> if everyone would've seen the full match,

I did. Spence had a brilliant first half, then faded in the second. His defensive positioning needs work, but then he was playing RB - a position he won't have practiced at all this season. Mostly I think he wasn't match fit, which is hardly surprising. After he went off things got much worse defensively.",Spurs,Yes,j7anznw,t1_j7aigxr
"> People judge Spence by 2-3 cherry picked clips, if everyone would've seen the full match, there wouldn't be a lot of praise.

Tell that to Rennes fans who gave him a standing ovation when he came off. I've watched the entire match, he's had a ropey 10 minutes in the end, but other than that did fine defensively, and has shown attacking quality neither of our two other senior RWB had before we got Porro. I've seen every single player in our backline outside of maybe Davies do much worse than him defensively this season.",Spurs,Yes,j7aiwqr,t1_j7aigxr
Almost as if he needs more minutes and experience at this level,Spurs,Yes,j7ajw2x,t1_j7aigxr
"You can cherry pick his areas of improvements all you like but there is no way you can justify starting Emerson over him in any match, let alone half a season.",Spurs,Yes,j7akfhi,t1_j7aigxr
His main struggle from the highlights seems to be playing out from the back. If he can tighten up his possession game playing week in week out this loan might be hugely beneficial for him,Spurs,Yes,j7ajybv,t1_j7aigxr
Only 1 game,Spurs,Yes,j7c6yfa,t1_j7c5ybr
"Straight red - 3 games

Second yellow - 1 game",Spurs,Yes,j7c7m4l,t1_j7c5ybr
I think he wanted a starting spot. And he was never going to get that at Spurs,Spurs,Yes,j7b6b2s,t1_j7ab9b1
"1. It's unlikely we'll play Wrexham. They're reasonable underdogs for their replay
2. Not convinced the added audience is an opportunity to add significantly more fans to Spurs. Casual 'Welcome to Wrexham' fans are not looking for another team to follow. They're probably not football fans in the first place. If they are they'll already be very familiar with Spurs.

It's a nice story, I like the Wrexham tale but it's a bigger opportunity for them than us. We've been in a CL final in the past 5 years",Spurs,Yes,j7b4kf3,t1_j7b2z9m
Arsenal still have to play city twice and are obviously going to drop points outside of that. Why would any apparently ‘real’ fans want us to lose a big game and damage our top 4 chances in the hope city catch up to them?,Spurs,Yes,j7an50p,t1_j7alapp
What a loser,Spurs,Yes,j7an2bk,t1_j7alapp
"I go to every game at home and a few away games a year. Who gives a shit about that shitty little club? You're just a banterless coward if it'll ""wreck your life"".

Up the Spurs! As controversial as that apparently is today.",Spurs,Yes,j7algmg,t1_j7alapp
"I've seen many horrible things but this is the most dog shit spineless take

Citeh needs 5 pts to take over and they can earn more than 50 pts if they go hard, we've won zero game against above us so far and some fan wishes us to lose just for a tiny minor inconvenience for them

You are just sitting on the other side but same kind of small club minded brainlets who shouts st totteringhams day regardless of winning fuck all, on top of casual discrimination",Spurs,Yes,j7aoogn,t1_j7alapp
"Hahaha.

Side over self mate.",Spurs,Yes,j7ar5lo,t1_j7alapp
"After our dominance over them in the league for a good few years, I just can’t deal with them winning the title the first year they’re good again … I just can’t",Spurs,Yes,j7ali17,t1_j7alapp
GTFO you plastic looser,Spurs,Yes,j7aw1yd,t1_j7alapp
Grow up,Spurs,Yes,j7b5qds,t1_j7alapp
I just wish people would chill re Spence. It's great he's looking to play week in week out and is looking good so far. But we have a world class RWB in Porro so we're fine,Spurs,Yes,j7b055a,t1_j7ax8i6
What are you on about?,Spurs,Yes,j7biep6,t1_j7bg8jw
"He did a much better job today then Porro would have. It wasn't at all Porros type of game. 

A good squad has different options, and he's a very solid defensive option.",Spurs,Yes,j7d41we,t1_j7d3tlb
"He had a very good performance against one of the best teams in Europe, on the back of having a couple of decent performances in last 2 games.

Yes, highly likely Porro will come in and do a great job as an attacking WB, does change his performance.

No need to shit on the guy, no need to caveat what was a candidate for MOTM performance.",Spurs,Yes,j7d8sh2,t1_j7d3tlb
"Think you’re going overboard on people having a bit of fun after he had a great game in a setup that suited what he’s always been pretty good at. That said, nothing like a top dollar signing at your position to light a fire.",Spurs,Yes,j7d65f8,t1_j7d3tlb
"Royal had a thundercunt cross that even Kane wasnt ready to hit properly, he's shaping up slowly i believe

That being said, can't wait to see PP steamrolling lowblocks with deki. Emerson showed today there's his place though",Spurs,Yes,j7d5fbl,t1_j7d3tlb
"The point is context. He’s been asked to do a job in a position he doesn’t play. No one is asking for him to be the nailed on starter, just asking for the guy to get a little respect for a great showing out of position. 

He doesn’t need people shitting in him and acting like he belongs in non-league football. Not everything is 0 or 100.",Spurs,Yes,j7dahr0,t1_j7d3tlb
I don't want to be hyperbolic but Royal is literally better than Messi and Ronaldo combined. We're living in Emerson's world.,Spurs,Yes,j7d7mat,t1_j7d3tlb
"Listen mate, I agree with half your opinions, but you have to learn that there is a huge space between top 5 in their position and League 2 level. A player with multiple seasons of experience in Serie A is pretty obviously not that bad.",Spurs,Yes,j7bmwk7,t1_j7bjd0j
"We haven't even seen this dude play in the premier league yet. 

Do you prefer Sessegnon over Udogie? 

What is this.",Spurs,Yes,j7bjmul,t1_j7bjd0j
Didn't we sign Richarlison for exactly this role?,Spurs,Yes,j7apgqs,t1_j7aon00
Wet spam won't sell to us.,Spurs,Yes,j7axm4r,t1_j7aon00
How do you feel about this now?,Spurs,Yes,j7c71d2,t1_j7bkmkj
Ali Gold said he’s been feeling under the weather all week tbf,Spurs,Yes,j7bm1r3,t1_j7bkmkj
he had 1 day in London before Conte was off to the hospital. quick your fucking crying,Spurs,Yes,j7byn9i,t1_j7bkmkj
I want THFC to win always,Spurs,Yes,j7aacfv,t1_j7a9ole
So what you’re saying is that you have more hate for Arsenal than support for Spurs?,Spurs,Yes,j7acjce,t1_j7a9ole
"No, they can still catch Arsenal regardless of today’s result. We need the points and the momentum it brings to our season",Spurs,Yes,j7abl1t,t1_j7a9ole
">We don't need to beat the league leaders to finish Top 4. Such games are a write off anyway.

what a shit take. if we had lost one of the matches to City last season we would have finished 5th.",Spurs,Yes,j7ac5up,t1_j7a9ole
 Man cares more about his rivals than his own team is what I’m getting from this. Fk the lot down the road. I’d rather us beat City. City have 6 points to take from the scum.,Spurs,Yes,j7al6gf,t1_j7a9ole
Eh fuck em. Do you see any of them now? They live for pessimism.,Spurs,Yes,j7coz8p,t1_j7cmguc
Yessir!,Spurs,Yes,j7de7sf,t1_j7d3q7c
"Dude calm. Leicester press like maniacs, they play right into our hands",Spurs,Yes,j7cakm0,t1_j7c99jt
Fuck Leicester. Kane will score against them. It is inevitable.,Spurs,Yes,j7cb5a7,t1_j7c99jt
COYS!,Spurs,Yes,j7ceqoo,t1_j7cegzq
"It’s not just on twitter, it’s my real life. Can’t deal with those smug fuckers.",Spurs,Yes,j7b7vt8,t1_j7amql3
This just confirms what I've been thinking about people on here just being social media supporters rather than enjoying the games on TV/attending.,Spurs,Yes,j7b5njq,t1_j7amql3
I actually don't remember it at all. Probably repressed the memories of the Nuno era.,Spurs,Yes,j7cbqnz,t1_j7cb734
Form doesnt matter when its derby's west ham have been shit all season but they were good against us same with chelsea,Spurs,Yes,j7d4n0z,t1_j7cot18
"City and Arsenal both out of the way. 

Chelsea, United and Brighton fixtures are at Home.

It's not fluff, the fixtures were top loaded on the first half of season.",Spurs,Yes,j7cp8y6,t1_j7cc7n2
Plus Arsenal don’t need our help bottling the league. They can do that all on their own.,Spurs,Yes,j7a9m56,t1_j7a72kn
"I'm not sure this City team is capable of going on the sort of win streak they need to, but they still have to play each other twice.",Spurs,Yes,j7cfeth,t1_j7c7iuu
"Arsenal has one match in hand over City, and two over us, but they still have to play City twice so that’s a positive. If they drop points in the next few matches against Brentford, City, and Villa away there’s a good chance City can overtake them by the time those two play their second match together in April that will likely be the title decider.",Spurs,Yes,j7cgo4q,t1_j7c7iuu
This is Fantastic! Definitely sinking pints in the Bill Nick beforehand,Spurs,Yes,j7atpov,t1_j7atdf9
"Pundits are constantly yelling that Foden should be playing in midfield for England (he shouldn't), but Grealish might be the more worthwhile experiment.",Spurs,Yes,j7cfs48,t1_j7byhiz
Conte is always in charge.,Spurs,Yes,j7ahb8g,t1_j7a8xmh
Stellini is on the touchline. He's not making any pre-match decisions independently of Conte though,Spurs,Yes,j7b6e1j,t1_j7a8xmh
"lol I'm a wizards fan, I just want to see my boi Rui Hachimura get a ring.

Basketball wise, this has been a horrible weekend, but I'm a bigger spurs fan than basketball fan.",Spurs,Yes,j7c75wv,t1_j7c6hs9
"Nah, you can't be doing that. I'd say suspend Casemiro for the rest of the season honestly.",Spurs,Yes,j7c9u1x,t1_j7c8z6e
"Soft as rice pudding, but undoubtedly a red.",Spurs,Yes,j7cdp9g,t1_j7c8z6e
"Yeah for a bit, now Barca has Sevilla on the ropes again.",Spurs,Yes,j7cx44t,t1_j7cx0cp
"It’s in the post match. They go inside the dressing room where Kane’s talking to Conte who’s on the phone, he’s on speakers. Kane asks him ‘I see you Wednesday yeah?’ And Dier comes screaming TWO DAYS OFF TWO DAYS OFF lmaoo

I’ll try clipping it if possible but that’s what happened",Spurs,Yes,j7cbe6b,t1_j7cb1ny
The Conte Regime,Spurs,Yes,j7cmd5i,t1_j7ceqen
Yeah but that yellow card and then the goal was just silly,Spurs,Yes,j7b8xh1,t1_j7b8hx1
"Romero was the spare man on our counter at least twice lmao, I love the absolute maniac",Spurs,Yes,j7c7ac2,t1_j7c6xnv
It builds no momentum for us or City.,Spurs,Yes,j7a8o0o,t1_j7a7pmu
"Feels good that there seem to be less and less alternative clubs for him to go to who are either big enough to match his ambition or wealthy enough to outspend us.

I'm getting more and more optimistic he'd stay for football reasons. Just a shame about the logistical problems with his family that can't really be solved",Spurs,Yes,j7cfixw,t1_j7cervy
Like Sess has done any better at defending though. He was torn apart against Preston. Rather be on the front foot against a relatively fragile City and try to win the game personally.,Spurs,Yes,j7auk1j,t1_j7aufdr
Twice the player that the uni student Sessegnon is.,Spurs,Yes,j7av3zq,t1_j7auto3

"If not now it’s inevitable.
I just kinda wanna see royal be a rcb with Romero in centre",Spurs,Yes,j7c5nou,t1_j7c5ir1
"i agree with this. If it comes down to the last game of the season, then fine, we'll lose so that Arsenal can win. However, today is not a big enough result to support this.",Spurs,Yes,j7bfvt2,t1_j7b28ag
"I used to work with a lad, 18. He was a gooner and he knew I was a Spurs supporter. One night we were out drinking, this was during the wenger days, he was wearing his arsenal shirt and getting drunk. Every so often he would grab the cannon and move it towards my face and say kiss the badge. On the third time I told him ""You do that one more time I'm going to rip that shirt from your back, drop it in the toilet and fucking shit on it. I fucking ment it. That little cunt made me so fucking angry that night. He didn't do it again. I get it.",Spurs,Yes,j7b2iwd,t1_j7aznee
Impossible,Spurs,Yes,j7b1r9f,t1_j7b1jjf
City winning today does not mean they will win the league. It just means Spurs are more likely not to finish top 4.,Spurs,Yes,j7bfx4m,t1_j7b1jjf
us taking the L today also increases the possibility of us finishing 5th and Arsenal finishing 1st. City winning does not guarantee them the league. I'm sorry.,Spurs,Yes,j7bfsvi,t1_j7bemou
"Id be up for it, if available, whenever we decide ro move on from son. Hopefully son picks up some better form and stays a while longer, but I wouldnt complain as much if we ended up with Kvararaskhelia after Son. Obviously, we would need to evaluate whenever that is, and levy could alway squander an opportunity",Spurs,Yes,j7bw67a,t1_j7beazm
"Yeah still barely halfway through. 54 points left to play for Arse, 6 of them against the team chasing them. 48 for us — there’s still so much to go.",Spurs,Yes,j7crgj7,t1_j7cq8ww

Yeah but Kane (90 + 6) slaps different. To break Greave's record too.,Spurs,Yes,j7ao520,t1_j7ao1up
Counting Romero who was actually signed when we were in the conference league.,Spurs,Yes,j7b38f5,t1_j7b2yqj
"I actually agree with you, but I'm saying look at that last post about spurs fans preferring to finish 17th over Arsenal winning the league. Even if we ""want that"" we NEED to win today. Spurs losing today means Spurs are less likely to finish top 4. It does NOT mean Arsenal are less likely to win the league. We control our own fate.",Spurs,Yes,j7bjk4p,t1_j7bi8qd
"nope, a bad loss to City today can ruin the whole rest of the Season. Team Morale is also important in these top 4 races as well as the locker room.",Spurs,Yes,j7blasp,t1_j7bkvwy
"You may think you can justify it, but the reality is we’ve seen 4 clips from one game and now you think he’s the new Messi. I’d back Conte’s decision over any fans. You haven’t watched him in training, watched him in the gym, looked at his numbers, spoken to him about tactics, watched his attitude etc etc etc. 


Some of you ‘Conte’s and idiot’ fans have somehow got this attitude that you know more than a man who is a serial winner. Know your ignorance",Spurs,Yes,j7alt3f,t1_j7akfhi
"You literally can. Emerson for all his faults provides good defensive cover, especially when Romero pushes forward at times.

Emerson has absolutely saved our skin a few times this year.

PLEASE touch grass. Conte is the coach & regardless if Spence was or wasn’t his choice signing he knows these players better than we do.",Spurs,Yes,j7am73p,t1_j7akfhi

"1. No, they're not going to just ""obviously"" drop points if you've watched their matches.   
2. It is not a ""big game"" for us as winning it will not give us a trophy nor losing it will relegate us.      
3. Top 4 is not a trophy which we should be chasing.   

We may finish 3rd or 4th or 5th or 6th, it won't make any difference to us - we still have to invest the same but them winning the league is insufferable.",Spurs,Yes,j7anu8x,t1_j7an50p

"I agree. In the games against the other big 6 where his main job is to defend he’s doing well, but he fucks us in many of the other games because he is supposed to be one of the main sources of creativity in this system, while providing next to none. Teams allow him the ball because he’s so bad with doing anything with it 9/10 times.",Spurs,Yes,j7d4dhd,t1_j7d41we
That is a bit exaggerated imo,Spurs,Yes,j7db2cv,t1_j7d7mat
All I ask is for people to watch the player I’m talking about instead of making generalised assumptions,Spurs,Yes,j7bny9j,t1_j7bmwk7

"Yeah but hes been made out off glass since he played through an injury for everton, getting another striker aint a bad idea",Spurs,Yes,j7b8wzh,t1_j7apgqs

"haha fairs,   
but I thinks its common agreement that Royal is a great RB but bad RWB",Spurs,Yes,j7cfcqo,t1_j7cbqnz
Just be aware I think they're a bit understaffed at the moment. When I was there for the Arsenal game it took me 20 mins standing at the bar to get served. Ended up in the No.8 instead where service was rapid.,Spurs,Yes,j7b1t9p,t1_j7atpov
Barca scored 3 goals after they both came on together,Spurs,Yes,j7czxz1,t1_j7cx44t
"Kinda cliche but you should focus on things that are in your control. Had they converted the 2 big chances they would have been clear 2-1 or atleast be on level terms. PL refs have been shite all season, can't think of a single gameweek without a ref blunder.",Spurs,Yes,j7bab9q,t1_j7b8xh1
"lol, a point can make the difference between champions league and europa league.especially in a season where we have a worse GD than the teams above and below us on the table

"Drawing to the league winners 100% builds momentum for us, what are you on about?",Spurs,Yes,j7ac1ju,t1_j7a8o0o

">  He was torn apart against Preston.

????",Spurs,Yes,j7auubx,t1_j7auk1j
If he was against Preston I didn't notice it. I feel like you can trust him to handle his man but he did admittedly not have a great showing against Saka,Spurs,Yes,j7auqt5,t1_j7auk1j

"Romero can't be himself and play CCB, would be a disaster",Spurs,Yes,j7c768f,t1_j7c5nou
"As I said, works both ways, but losing today increases the chance of City winning the league and that's the scenario I'd always take over us getting top 4 but scum ending 1st. I don't know if one can call himself a Spurs fan if he's fine with them winning PL, it means he doesn't understand this rivalry at all.

Don't take this personally btw., I saw your other comment. It's directed more at all the folk here who think them winning the league is not a big deal.",Spurs,Yes,j7bgtsy,t1_j7bfsvi
"Would you rather count Porro instead, considering we've actually signed him this season? The result is the same.",Spurs,Yes,j7b4b0q,t1_j7b38f5
It totally does because City are the team we are playing.,Spurs,Yes,j7bn0ry,t1_j7bjk4p
">Some of you ‘Conte’s and idiot’ fans have somehow got this attitude that you know more than a man who is a serial winner. Know your ignorance

It's the other way around actually. Some of you seem to just worship him and think he can do no wrong even when he has regressed the squad vs last season even after getting 7 new signings. The delusion in you lot is astounding. Our results don't lie. Just open your fucking eyes.",Spurs,No,j7aneuk,t1_j7alt3f
"I am amazed how some of you start believing Emerson is good even after literally seeing him kill our games and us having a shit season because of him.   

Open your eyes when you watch our games. please.",Spurs,Yes,j7an40g,t1_j7am73p
"Of course, real spurs fans should hope we slip back into europa/conference league mediocrity and not compete in the best tournaments. No game is an important game if it’s not a cup final as well, of course.",Spurs,Yes,j7apvja,t1_j7anu8x
"Nah mate, sorry, you're wrong.

You're just a scared little coward. Scared of gooner fans too, give me strength.

"Oh yeah absolutely. Its horses for courses. But he is a useful option now I think. He's also just got unbelievable mentality as well. Man was booed off and on to the pitch in 2 different games, but his head didnt drop at all. It's actually pretty mad when you think how few players wouldnt be affected by that. 

He seems like a good bloke too and liked in the dressing room.",Spurs,Yes,j7d5nmk,t1_j7d4dhd
"Underexaggerated? I couldn't agree more. I forgot to include Cafu on that list. 

Guaranteed Balon d'Or winner for the next decade",Spurs,Yes,j7dfc0m,t1_j7db2cv

"Sess didn't have great games against Arsenal or Preston. He has pace but I can't see him being Tactically effective going forward against Man City. On the other hand Perisic has less pace and wasn't great at defending against Man City last time around. We kind of need someone with an extremely high work rate to constantly press, harass, and unsettle in that position. I don't know the answer.",Spurs,Yes,j7avp2d,t1_j7auqt5
Yeah and Saka took Sess for a joy ride just a few weeks ago. At least Perisic offers something going forward.,Spurs,Yes,j7avvxk,t1_j7av7b7
"I hate Chelsea more than Arsenal. I am way more jealous of Chelsea and their sugar daddy money. Even if Arsenal win the league, they will never win a Champions League which is still a good thing.",Spurs,Yes,j7bhija,t1_j7bgtsy

"City can rebound from a loss to Spurs. 

Can't say the same with Spurs.",Spurs,Yes,j7bn7tf,t1_j7bn0ry
"Please look at our team as a whole. We have more problems than Emerson Royal. We have issues with our fucking midfielders during transitional phases, our CBs outside of Romero are wank & one of our attackers literally cannot score to save his life while still playing near full 90s nearly twice a week.

But sure, all of our problems come from Emerson Royal & we replace him with a player who clearly hasn’t picked up the game at the level required for him to be a starter for us solves everything.",Spurs,Yes,j7aoxi3,t1_j7an40g
"> us having a shit season because of him.

Yeah it's definitely Emerson, who is playing exactly like he did last season, not Son and Lloris who forgot how to play football",Spurs,Yes,j7aq2qa,t1_j7an40g

Mf i’m waiting,Spurs,Yes,j7cb2sb,t1_j7an40g
"real fans hope we spend money and compete for titles - not this shit show of ""I hope we get top 4"". ENIC has you on strings - they invest just enough to compete for Top 4 and not more than that.   

Real fans don't talk about finishing Top 4.",Spurs,Yes,j7aq2f0,t1_j7apvja
"It's not about the gooner fans. Nobody gives a fuck about those losers. 

Again, as I said, you don't know anything because you're hardly connected to the club. Forming baseless arguments and arguing online just like the tourist plastic fan that you are.",Spurs,Yes,j7an8g9,t1_j7alv0w

"> Yeah and Saka took Sess for a joy ride just a few weeks ago

Saka got past Sess zero (0) times. Lloris not being able to save a shot straight at his face really made people think Sess got destroyed huh.",Spurs,Yes,j7aw81y,t1_j7avvxk
Sessegnon made Saka shoot from an angle that should’ve been a routine save for Lloris how did he get taken for a joyride?,Spurs,Yes,j7ayml3,t1_j7avvxk

"This summer window we got Richarlison, Bissouma, Perisic, and Lenglet for the first team, last season in the summer we got Romero and Emerson. We've definitely done more to strengthen the team this summer, even if you only count one window for some reason.",Spurs,Yes,j7b6ftk,t1_j7b5fcg

"You must not be a fan of the club then if you want them to lose the fucking game on purpose, that's not wanting what's best for the club. Get a grip “real fan”",Spurs,Yes,j7aqm68,t1_j7aq2f0

"Plastic because I have a season ticket and want spurs to win their games..? Genuinely intrigued if you understand what the word plastic means? Because wanting your team to lose so that their rivals might have a slightly harder go of it half a season down the line is getting pretty fucking close to polymerisation.

Either way, I'm more connected than you'll ever be, sunshine. If I were any more involved with spurs I'd have fuck all else going on in my life. As apparently is the case with you. You plastic :)",Spurs,Yes,j7anjjt,t1_j7an8g9

"This is a another take he’s wrong with (to a degree) he’s raw yes but he’s explosive and a top goal scorer for his age (and he’s a wingback lol) guy will need a lot of coaching like any young player but will develop into a top player under Conte.

but he does love Sonny. Come on Son, convince him to manage us lol.",Spurs,Yes,j77ffvt,t1_j77e0yc
This is the way,Spurs,Yes,j77eyoi,t1_j77e0yc
"Klopp falls in love. He will never manage another EPL team. If he is fired, he will go to a different league. But I think he's safe till the end of the season and he'll get given a chance to rebuild.",Spurs,Yes,j77pwmj,t1_j77e0yc
"He just switched off and nearly cost a goal. Ligue 1 Is also quite a step down from the prem, Spence should be looking good here or he doesn't have a hope. Royal and Doherty would also look very good and so would sess probably.  

I'm not saying he's not going to be good but this is all part of his development!",Spurs,Yes,j78fbps,t1_j78di35
Lmao. Imagine he starts Spence. Spence does alright shows promise and satisfies your weird obsession with him. Do we go in for Porro?,Spurs,Yes,j78hr9t,t1_j78di35
Defends very lazily,Spurs,Yes,j78fe8b,t1_j78ez7k
spence rodon right side of defence lol,Spurs,Yes,j77txi1,t1_j77tjdk
"No, it was shite.",Spurs,Yes,j782hh9,t1_j77z2qx
Which guy,Spurs,Yes,j78ftjw,t1_j78f8nu
Are you talking about Ten Hag?,Spurs,Yes,j78g7cg,t1_j78f8nu
Because Hitchen is a fraud. Simple.,Spurs,Yes,j78inei,t1_j78f8nu
iirc one of the reasons was that he wasn't planning on bringing any backroom staff with him.,Spurs,Yes,j78nis6,t1_j78f8nu
"starting to think he wanted more control in the transfer policy (look at United's now ) than what Levy/Fabio would have liked. Makes sense that bizarre reasons like his language , bringing in no backrooom staff were given because for a team in turmoil that season, a good manager who had his say in transfers would be fine,but he was always a manger for the top clubs so there was always this risk of backing him and then a City/United/Bayern swoop in for him and we would have been stranded.",Spurs,Yes,j79gqr7,t1_j78f8nu
No it was a loan so very much a club vibe,Spurs,Yes,j7600kv,t1_j75skff
"It's hard to call. The safe bet is that we'd stick with the usual team, but then I half feel like we might go all out and throw a surprise at home against City with the new signings. But then again, Conte is out, so would they really be changing things up without him making decisions at the training ground? Or maybe he is still quite involved without directly leading the training sessions?",Spurs,Yes,j76404h,t1_j763qzb
"But emerson was great in the city game, i say sub porro on at half time",Spurs,Yes,j764k5e,t1_j763qzb
Fuck off tbh Emerson has been fine the last few games. Conte not being present to access Porro at all before the game makes it more likely Emerson will start imo,Spurs,Yes,j763xty,t1_j763qzb
"Unrelated, but I've just realised your name is a Tame Impala reference, right on!",Spurs,Yes,j76a0uo,t1_j7682ia
"He wasn't horrible on defence, stop taking Kunt's opinion at face value. He was fine for 70 minutes, and below par for 10. They conceded 2 goals in the ten minutes after he was taken off, so the idea that he was somehow their defensive weak spot is ridiculous.",Spurs,Yes,j78jyp0,t1_j78j1sr
"Listen, we should root for the Spurs to win. What is this small club mentality lol. If they lose, fine we can be less pissed, but we should still want Spurs to win. Obviously City should be the favorites anyway, so there is no point in rooting for City to win tomorrow.",Spurs,Yes,j76v8xq,t1_j76trwz
"Plenty of times for Arsenal to drop another six points, we need to get every point we can. I won't be very upset if we lose however.",Spurs,Yes,j76uph1,t1_j76trwz
No,Spurs,Yes,j78p94s,t1_j78ndkm
"who cares, we might be able to finish 3rd. I'll take 3rd + a trophy any day of the week. Hell Arsenal could win the quadruple for all I care. I want a trophy and top 4, fuck arsenal and fuck Partey.",Spurs,Yes,j797exx,t1_j78ndkm
Yes,Spurs,Yes,j794jvt,t1_j78ndkm
Not happy with goals just to embarass us. Just lose the match gracefully 1-0.,Spurs,Yes,j79ge47,t1_j78ndkm
Teams who play in Europe during the week are given priority for Sunday games,Spurs,Yes,j76vwd2,t1_j76uv30

"Nobody, they won't sack him and rightly so, he's top 3 managers in the world, won the league and CL. Only until after he won all the biggest trophies have they since fallen into a multi-year injury crisis affecting their most important players, all whilst they haven't backed him at all. Needed a midfielder for three years and they buy 6 attackers. 

FSG clearly looking to sell, there's no one better available. It would be absolutely insane to sack him from every conceivable perspective. He's not going anywhere unless he quits.",Spurs,Yes,j79bkds,t1_j798mai
We should hire Klopp if we get the chance. He will absolutely cook with the midfielders we have.,Spurs,Yes,j79g78h,t1_j798mai

Funny how right after losing the first thing you do is check the Spurs subreddit. Live in your head much?,Spurs,Yes,j775hhs,t1_j77188g
Yet you’re the only Arsenal fan to come post over here. You’ve singled yourself out as the saddest loser out of 300k people on that sub well done.,Spurs,Yes,j777cyy,t1_j77188g
Celebrates a rapist every week,Spurs,Yes,j775hbf,t1_j77188g

Arsenal are in trouble. Nketiah in the room.",Spurs,Yes,j77276c,t1_j77188g
lol Arsenal fans are downvoting me.  Focus on your own subreddit you clowns lol.,Spurs,Yes,j76vdfo,t1_j76qr18
Fuck off loser. Were still allowed to enjoy them looking like they'll bottle the league,Spurs,Yes,j76polv,t1_j76pjx8
They just lost to 19th Everton. How can you not laugh?,Spurs,Yes,j76qery,t1_j76pjx8
"Eat me, killjoy. That’s a humiliating loss.",Spurs,Yes,j76ppgr,t1_j76pjx8
Come on mate lmfao,Spurs,Yes,j76qspk,t1_j76pjx8
"yep. Laughing at Arsenal is as funny as laughing at England.

Oh wait, they both are hilarious lol.

Its coming home! Its coming home! footballs coming hooomee.

U mad bro?",Spurs,Yes,j76rhbc,t1_j76pjx8
"14 pts ahead but 2.5 years ahead in their rebuild also, apples to oranges",Spurs,Yes,j771xzz,t1_j76pjx8
">utterly shite defensively just like Romero

![gif](giphy|x0npYExCGOZeo|downsized)",Spurs,Yes,j78g4sr,t1_j78fivt
"> the opposition have an easy day down his side

They definitely didn't, they had like one good attack from the left.

>Even though he’s good 1v1 unlike Romero, his off ball positioning + work rate is downright shite

He's been there for 4 days, playing in an unfamiliar formation as an RB instead of his natural RWB. People were saying Emerson was defensively shit after he was thrown against Zaha after being with us for like 4 days.",Spurs,Yes,j78ft3a,t1_j78fivt
"Even though he’s good 1v1 unlike Romero, 

i'm sorry what? You still on this? Romero is still a top 10 CB in the league even if he is off-form. Keep sucking off Hitchens. 

You can say Emerson is a shit signing, but Romero? What are talking about?",Spurs,Yes,j78ikh9,t1_j78fivt
I wouldn't go that far but I'd definitely agree Romero isn't a great defender in terms of leaving a ton of space behind him and losing his man. Genuinely elite ball player and he times his last ditch tackles well though.,Spurs,Yes,j78iz4w,t1_j78fivt
Norwich didn't have the legend that is Dyche.,Spurs,Yes,j75snvr,t1_j75mrdp
If there is one man who can get a relegation team to beat top of the table it’s Sean Dyche. In Dyche we trust.,Spurs,Yes,j75vj3z,t1_j75mrdp
why not,Spurs,Yes,j774v9p,t1_j77063z
That’s tough to say after today. Arsenal are young and have been very easily shaken by the occasion in years past,Spurs,Yes,j778ia8,t1_j770ufa
"He won’t get half a billion to rebuild the squad here. Every decent PL manager having so much to spend on rebuild would be near the top. Btw, he’s an ex gunner, why would we want him here",Spurs,Yes,j774kev,t1_j7747d8
"No way, I've said it forever, if they backed Emery the same way they backed Arteta they would have been in their current position just as quick if not sooner.

When you spend like they have, year after year, their current position should be the expectation, not a surprise.",Spurs,Yes,j774zmm,t1_j7747d8
good grief,Spurs,Yes,j77b6vi,t1_j7747d8
Wtf,Spurs,Yes,j77hoa9,t1_j7747d8

Don’t forget that this is the same club that spent 80mil on Maguire.,Spurs,No,j77kkwz,t1_j77hzt3
"Law twitter discussion this morning, the image was singled out as an example because of the watermark. I don't think they understood the significance of Eriksen but it sparked that big time nostalgia here.",Spurs,Yes,j79g7yx,t1_j795if4
"There have been plenty of good CBs going for reasonable fees as well, we just don't get them",Spurs,Yes,j76ckt5,t1_j75p29a
We're doing the Liverpool thing where we're waiting on a good player that we probably won't get Gvardiol/Bellingham only to miss out on good players that we could've gotten Badiashile/KMJ/Enzo just because we need a 100% success at that position so instead we go a whole season with a shit defense/Midfield,Spurs,Yes,j760qs4,t1_j75opia
"Yeah my question wasn’t great tbf, I’m Salernitana and the transfer window has just closed, I’m 5 games in to the season and haven’t scored a goal yet lmao but also the defence is very leaky (doesn’t help that my captain is Fazio). I think my midfield has been the issue with a lack of defensive cover because I’ve been playing 433 which must be too expansive for the players I’ve got. 

Would a 4222 with 2 dms be a solid base for me to build from?",Spurs,Yes,j76j2n5,t1_j76irxl
The haircut gives him a punchable face,Spurs,Yes,j75qx73,t1_j75p4r7
"I know utd fans were pissed, but grabbing someone's neck should be a serious penalty. I'd give him 5 games tbh",Spurs,Yes,j7785jw,t1_j777pz7
Agreed 😆,Spurs,Yes,j76qe98,t1_j76q88c
"Yet I do understand the merits of Emerson starting, and he has been good recently (even scored against City) but I can't wait to watch Porro play lol",Spurs,Yes,j777lzd,t1_j77580p
"Yeah but tbf its easy to sometimes criticize players for not making the correct decision from our view on tele, its a lot more difficult to spot and find the correct pass when you are on the pitch.

Agree about bentancur, Sess is another player who I think has great decision making but his execution has been very poor lately.",Spurs,Yes,j77t1d5,t1_j77ongg
"Sort of like Poch at PSG

think we need to rethink this idea that there are managers who are good in every situation. Pep Guardiola is an amazing manager but I’d like to see what he does with a relegation tier squad. Sean Dyche was class for Burnley but he likely wouldn’t really know what to do with a squad like City’s

Managing a top tier squad to win the league is very different to managing plucky underdogs to maybe get into European spots",Spurs,Yes,j76de0j,t1_j7686xu
Why feel bad for him? Supposedly he thought himself above Spurs when we were looking for a manager and ended up with Nuno.,Spurs,Yes,j760j1i,t1_j75yx4a

I’ll be gutted but I’ll understand,Spurs,Yes,j76dejz,t1_j76346i
"Right. Makes sense with Son, Richi who can play there and the signing of Danjuma. Just can’t help but think how creative our attack would be at the wings with Kulu, Mitoma, Porro and Perisic/maybe Udogie.",Spurs,Yes,j77kqe8,t1_j77jcxu
"Agreed, but I doubt he’s going anywhere. Much of the new talent they’ve brought in is with his system in mind.  He’ll be given  at least most of next season to right the ship.",Spurs,Yes,j77j42p,t1_j77fyq1
Think he’d take a break or leave the prem and not come back. Doesn’t really have anything to prove here anymore and it’s clear hes not going to be backed until FSG sells,Spurs,Yes,j7827yk,t1_j77fyq1
"I rate Porro way higher than Spence. I definitely don’t have an obsession with him, don’t know where you’re getting that from. I am just sick and tired of that donkey Emerson. Nothing against him as a person, but so haven’t hated watching a player as much as him in a while.",Spurs,Yes,j78i0ax,t1_j78hr9t

"I'm just saying even if he is a bad defender, as long as he can attack I'm good.

I will be upset with a loss. There is no guarantee Man City wont drop points after us.,Spurs,Yes,j76v56m,t1_j76uph1
It's past the halfway point and they'd have a game in hand too. City need every point.,Spurs,Yes,j76vqoz,t1_j76uph1

Yeah but a big chance Liverpool will sack or Klopp will want to get out. In that case..,Spurs,Yes,j79bx2m,t1_j79bkds
"Absolutely not me thinks. The league has been shifting in terms of managerial style since the COVID season. The end of high intensity , high pressing football **as a philosophy** is here. It is a cycle that needs to be reset every 4-5 seasons and a team need absolute precision in recruitment to navigate that. Plus the league has seen a lot of managers willing to adapt their systems to different style thrive in recent times like Tuchel,De Zerbi,Howe,Silva, Frank while not compromising their core view of footballing philosophy \[Poch is closest manager we have had who fits this description\]. We need a manager who plays attacking football,  but who isn't afraid to switch things up to win than an Anti-Conte who just plays attacking football but is adamant in implementing his style.",Spurs,Yes,j79iilp,t1_j79g78h
"Of course, also one player who absolutely will marvel in a Klopp system is Son.",Spurs,Yes,j79gfoz,t1_j79g78h

What has happened to this sub?",Spurs,Yes,j78jn3w,t1_j78iz4w
"The only reason it’s ‘last ditch’ in the first place is because he doesn’t position himself correctly

Definitely agree with you!",Spurs,Yes,j77bjja,t1_j778ia8

In what world could we ever have afforded Enzo,Spurs,Yes,j76bdeb,t1_j760qs4
"I think a 4-2-2-2 can work but you leave yourself very light in midfield. A 4-4-2 would be better for a smaller team I think, it’s much more compact whereas a 4-2-4 is very expansive but it’s difficult to find traditional wingers in a top league. 

If you think you can score goals at the expense of defence I think it’s better to play a 4-2-4 like if you believe you can outscore the opponent but you haven’t scored a goal so it’s a holistic issue which in real football is solved by reverting to something simple and compact. 

Something else that can work is a 4-2-3-1 with a Shadow Striker or an AM and then an asymmetric midfield with a DM on one side and a CM on the other because the CM will naturally drop deep when you don’t have the ball especially if he’s a B2B. Sometimes I wish FM had a “with the ball” and a “without the ball” tactic so you could set up different shapes because that’s how it works in real football.

But ultimately there’s no like one size fits all tactic, like some bits of this might work for you, others won’t and I think the best way to do it is to pick a tactic and then make small tweaks to it once your side is familiar with it and identify one problem at a time to fix and most importantly try not to panic about it and change things wholesale when your team has already become used to a tactic.

If all else fails download a tactic and say you made it lol",Spurs,Yes,j76klyv,t1_j76j2n5
Yankable hair surely,Spurs,Yes,j75tg0t,t1_j75qx73
I would give him 15 games tbh,Spurs,Yes,j77cj6c,t1_j7785jw
Yeah I was going to make that point. There are shades of grey here for sure. Sometimes certain things are not “seen” on pitch as well. But it’s not necessarily about vision IQ. Decision making has as much to do with operating within a limited vision even. Interesting point about Sess. I’ve never seen him as a “high IQ” sort….Any examples of that from earlier?,Spurs,Yes,j77wvcu,t1_j77t1d5
Just comes across like a nice man,Spurs,Yes,j7631bt,t1_j760j1i
So do you think if Spence came in and showed promise we’d get the higher rate win now player that Porro promised to be? Mate what I’m telling you is that Conte knows better than us what it takes for Levy to prioritize spending. Two quality wingbacks make us a menace next season,Spurs,Yes,j78ijxm,t1_j78i0ax

">The only reason it’s ‘last ditch’ in the first place is because he doesn’t position himself correctly

"Yeah that makes sense, I actually started with a 442 but again I was getting run over, but I think that may have been down to using 2 centre mids and no dm. Would 1 dm and a deep lying playmaker work? Or is that just asking to get run over again?

Unfortunately I’m on the PS5 version so I can’t download a tactic as far as I’m aware lmao, I appreciate the tips tho. It’s been a learning curve getting back into FM for the first time since 2015 lmao",Spurs,Yes,j76l51u,t1_j76klyv
why not the whole season lol.,Spurs,Yes,j77cv58,t1_j77cj6c
"Just in general whenever he plays he makes he good runs and finds himself in good goalscoring positions, very rarely offside, knows when to cut inside or go outside and put a cross in (even though his crossing has been very poor lately). He plays good one two and with other players and his defensive positioning is solid. I know right now all this might sound really weird given how he has performed this season but I still think his decision making is very good for his age.",Spurs,Yes,j7819g1,t1_j77wvcu
"That's fair... but I mean, it's not exactly like he's going to become destitute if he doesn't succeed with one of our main footballing rivals. After they throw like half a billion pounds at him to build a squad no less.",Spurs,Yes,j763oj5,t1_j7631bt
"You guys are coming up with so much bs it’s unreal. Every time Conte persists with his favourites even though they have no business being on the pitch, you lot act like it’s deliberate to send Levy a message.",Spurs,Yes,j78iu9w,t1_j78ijxm

Yeah if they are looking for Tuchel then Conte is of course a possibility.,Spurs,Yes,j79tdkp,t1_j79qjcx

More like don't swear with strangers just for the sake of it. Like you know when a father teaches his kid how to act.,Spurs,Yes,j79mw69,t1_j79li2y
Then what do you think if Bonucci and Chiellini?,Spurs,Yes,j78l7yl,t1_j78l1y1
"Would you replace him, or do you think he's valuable in a back 3 where his defensive weaknesses are less exposed? And how do you think he'll go in a back 4, asking as conte might be off soon.",Spurs,Yes,j78yk2q,t1_j78l1y1
"Yeah but something as basic as tracking your runner should happen 100/100 times. Switching off is a bad sign

Btw this might’ve been the first time you saw him do it, wherever I watched him (incl Forest) he genuinely couldn’t care about runners in behind",Spurs,Yes,j78h1s2,t1_j78g89y
I mean that’s an assumption you created. You CBA about an assumption you create then that’s not my problem really,Spurs,Yes,j78ls9t,t1_j78lgmn
While we’re at it we might as well have scooped up Messi when he was 14 and chucked him in our academy,Spurs,Yes,j76ctaw,t1_j76cil0
"Yeah that can definitely work as a compact setup but a BWM can also act as a playmaker on support if you don’t have a playmaker in the setup but obviously won’t be as expansive as a DLP on support because they don’t have the “take more risks” instruction on, but you can have them do that too. It’s about how compact and deep you want to be, you should be wary of playing TOO deep because FM doesn’t like that. It’s always better imo to play with at least a standard defensive line, rather than a lower line because FM always seems to favour less defensive tactics and to be frank the defending AI is wank this year, whereas the attacking AI is really good.",Spurs,Yes,j76mrgi,t1_j76l51u
"did Gold say that? Also if we turned Ten Hag down, it was Hitchens and Levy who mostly turned him down. not paratici.",Spurs,Yes,j78liky,t1_j78kekh
"You can form one yourself. Watch the guy and you’ll find out

When you do though, understand I was/am right when I say Romero can’t defend",Spurs,Yes,j78mycb,t1_j78mdgp
"Just watch him regularly. He doesn’t have the technique nor the body shape to cross a ball

And the two crosses were ground crosses btw. Nowhere close to head height",Spurs,Yes,j78mrxg,t1_j78mnfy
yes sir the spurs lol.,Spurs,Yes,j7723jw,t1_j771li3

Ok boomer,Spurs,Yes,j79ohjg,t1_j79mw69
Of old or in their prime? Cuz two different players,Spurs,Yes,j78lel6,t1_j78l7yl
"IMO if Romero can reel in his aggression and only challenge for balls that are there to be won, and makes the right decision 90% of the time then he’d be invaluable for us

It can be trained because in Argentina’s back 4, he’s exactly like that. It’s controlled aggression not all out aggression like how he is for us. It’s so only because he knows he doesn’t have cover and can’t jeopardise the back line by going for a ball that’s not his and losing the duel. Watch him for Spurs and he does that regularly. I’d say he’d do well in a back 4 if continuously switched on and doesn’t forget the fact that he has no cover 

His ball playing is out of the world so replacing that would be insanely hard. Reel in his aggression and for once people might be right about having the potential to be a top defender",Spurs,Yes,j79gqu6,t1_j78yk2q
"That was never close to happening though, don't get why you're being a smarmy cunt.",Spurs,Yes,j77md9c,t1_j76ctaw

Makes sense. Hopefully with age and maturity he does jsut this.,Spurs,Yes,j7a5dh8,t1_j79gqu6
Lmfao and we were never close to signing Enzo either so whats the relevance? If we did sign him while he was young and at River Plate as opposed to signing an established player you’d be crying about a lack of ambition,Spurs,Yes,j77mydw,t1_j77md9c
"If you want more in depth stuff then check out Zealand’s videos, I’ve played FM for over two decades now and I’ve never learned more about the game than I did from his videos",Spurs,Yes,j76pu19,t1_j76pf0i
"His starting point is much much higher than Emerson so yes, I’ve seen him hit okay crosses when he has time and space so he might not become Trips but with regular training he will become better than a Walker let’s say",Spurs,Yes,j79g79j,t1_j78xy5d
"Both were excellent in their strong areas. Bonnuci was a playmaker from deep but was a bull in the air and very rarely let his team down by making mistakes and Chiellini was a top notch defender who was the last and first man multiple times, would never get beat",Spurs,Yes,j78m0a9,t1_j78lg3u
"> If we did sign him while he was young and at River Plate as opposed to signing an established player you’d be crying about a lack of ambition

If we had a coach that would actually play this type of player who would complain? If the coach asks for established players and gets South American kids then there's a disconnect.",Spurs,Yes,j78dr4c,t1_j77mydw

Really? The reddit experts told me there were no good CBs that we could've signed in the past year which is why we had to settle for Lenglet on loan.,Spurs,Yes,j73mdlc,t1_j73lmzh
Yeah agreed. Like obviously Dele has not maximized his potential as a player and that's a shame but it's really not anyone's else's problem but his own. Would wish people would just leave him alone tbh,Spurs,Yes,j728xwz,t1_j71wzfx
"Totally agreed. A big breakthrough for me to stop trying to analyze the situation was reading someone say *not everyone is career-focused, footballers included*. Everyone is entitled to take their job as seriously or not as they want, and that includes professional athletes.

Point being - everyone is trying to analyze Dele's career arc when he's just a human being like the rest of us. Whatever happened, we'll probably never know unless he talks about it.",Spurs,Yes,j729k75,t1_j71wzfx
"For about 3 years I was completely with you. But for it to happen repeatedly under different managers and then different clubs I had to give in. 

As for the cause, the first time I saw it was in Poch's book 

“A year ago,” Pochettino writes in the book – and this was back in 2016 –  
 “you could yell at Dele during a session. But now you have to strike a   
different tone. You have to deal with them more sensitively, grant them   
the odd privilege that would have been impossible before. It is a very   
delicate balance.”

“The danger,” he writes in his book, “remains that he’ll forget what has  
 got him to this point. I’ve had to repeat that to him this season. The   
other risk is whether those around him know how to treat a top-level   
professional. His WhatsApp photo of a cartoon of a boy surrounded by   
people who all want a piece of him suggests that he needs to be   
surrounded by the right people.”",Spurs,Yes,j72576t,t1_j71wzfx

"What kind of fan wants us to lose any game? My brother go's for the Arse and i'll have to put up with more shit than most here, but he can say whatever he likes it's still no where near enough for my to want spurs to lose any game",Spurs,Yes,j72vgbv,t1_j72rym6

">Why is this the only place full of vitriol for THST? I'm not even staunch ENIC out, but the reaction to the board's statement here was veering into bootlicking

Edit: downvotes again proving my point.",Spurs,Yes,j73cf4f,t1_j73ajyx
"Reddit is quite a unique platform where most communities are very contrarian but portray themselves as the real-world popular opinion (lots of good write ups of this online mostly about the political subreddits). This place is no different and is the only Spurs community I can think of that doesn't reflect the everyday reality. 

Add to that most fans here are overseas and the trust mainly represent the local match-going fanbase then you get lots of people confused about who they are and what they do. 

ENIC good ""popular opinion"" + thing people don't know about saying bad things about ENIC = ""bad thing I must hate"".

Yep deffo. Got a great run of fixtures coming up and I doubt he starts against city anyway,Spurs,Yes,j71lpwy,t1_j71jprq
"Next week maybe not, but we have a good run of fixtures soon and he seems like a massive bargain.

Completely seperate matter of whether we actually want any though.,Spurs,Yes,j72c1ig,t1_j72bmua

"Hincapie and van de Ven

Edit: I also think Bastoni might actually be possible. Still haven't extended 1 year left in the summer Inter are in trouble and didn't manage to get paid for Skriniar who's leaving on a free.

"Every fan is entitled to be a fan however they wish. But I personally don't care enough about Arsenal to want us to lose any match, let alone to City at home. Any dropped points makes it that much harder for us to get top 4, which needs to be our goal for the league this season.

Also, worth remembering that City have 2 matches still against Arsenal. If City don't win the league, it'll be because they didn't take advantage of those matches.",Spurs,Yes,j72nfmp,t1_j72lftg

"I 1000% agree with you about ""the next best alternative"" approach we should have, and that's where I think our scouting needs to be exponentially better. Paratici has hired some new scouting talent, so hopefully that leads to improvement in finding those players that flop less often.

I think that's a bit of a harsh assessment of our midfield, but not overly harsh.

* I think PEH would be a fantastic squad player, but I generally agree that we should look to upgrade on his technical ability if we can. Squad players are an important part of a ""title-winning core in midfield"".
* At worst, jury is still out on Bissouma. He deserves at least until some part through next season to prove himself. Different players take different amounts of time to bed into a new environment, new team & teammates, new manager, new systems of play, etc.
* If you think Sarr has the potential, then I think Skipp does as well and he's demonstrated it during Conte's early days. I know that's a matter of personal opinion, 

Of all the general positions to improve on, I don't think midfield is the one to focus in on as opposed to centerbacks.",Spurs,Yes,j72cebw,t1_j7291j5

"Perhaps because we are realistic and not fantasists.  I have been watching Spurs for coming up 35 years and ENIC have delivered the best teams of that period barring the very start of it.  We were left a long, long way behind the curve due to being absolute rubbish and insolvent when the Premier League kicked off.  We also got the hammer for financial irregularities and were nearly relegated as penalty.

Poch was a victim of his own success, and failure.  Half the amazing team he had was there when he took over and his choices in the transfer market  - ie don't sign anybody at all and do sign GLC, Ndombele etc - have ruined us for years.

We didn't cost-cut at RWB for Spence, we invested in a young player who may well end up making us a profit or being a first team player.  We couldn't get Porro in the summer despite trying as Paratici himself said.

We are competing in the PL and we are improving the squad, we're just not the best team and don't have the deepest pockets.  What you seem to aspire to is being the next Chelsea or Man City which almost nobody really wants deep down.  It will be the end of the club in spirit.  

It would do fans, especially new fans, to get real about what kind of club we are and what is possible.  We can be better, but the only way we spend big is to earn big.  That has been the focus for the last several years.  We are in a position to continuously invest in the squad but we are never going to financially dope the team.  

In 2017 our revenue was 180m behind Chelsea, 200m behind Arsenal 250m behind City and >400m behind United.   Why ever didn't we outspend them while building a stadium?  The answers are bloody obvious.

The only path to success is to incrementally build the team (and be good at recruiting instead of very poor) or to sell out the club to a gulf state and financially the dope the team.  Bahrain FC.

"There was a report today that they're not going to pay 25m for him, but are considering buying him at a discount, so I guess that clause wasn't put in place. Still, getting rid of him at any price would be a good thing at this point.",Spurs,Yes,j71htv5,t1_j71hcpi
"I hope so, he came from playing a similar system and the wingback role is pretty well defined. You see teams like Chelsea chucking Enzo straight into the starting 11, we should be confident to do the same. Porro is class and can handle it.",Spurs,Yes,j73689o,t1_j7317yy
Good god get a grip,Spurs,Yes,j71itw5,t1_j70vrin
Will never understand anyone who is praying for a spurs loss and a spurs player to be red carded to top it off. Moving like fraudulent fans,Spurs,Yes,j70zkgq,t1_j70vrin

If you can look past the occasional danny rant vftl has been very good for a while now especially due to Eccleshare. His replacement Tim spiers on the other hand is a very boring guy and from his tweets/coverage of spurs he doesn't enjoy covering spurs either so hopefully Eccleshare returns soon.,Spurs,Yes,j73f9fz,t1_j72wdm0

"What a dumb comment. If we ever want to catch up, having cl gives us an advantage as we have more financial capability and pull.

"I mean if we don’t get CL this season we’re just giving the club an excuse not to spend, and if we win the CL we don’t even really need to get top 4",Spurs,Yes,j71jmwr,t1_j71j3vi
">they aren't using this position to make the football club actually challenge for trophies

This line is so critical to me.   

Seasons after seasons of Top 4 have given us nothing.   

What was the reward for finishing Top 4 last season? A Clement Lenglet on loan and our defence being even worse than last season with Dier and Lloris declining.   

Top 4 should just not be counted as an achievement. It's only an agenda by ENIC since it helps them with more revenue. It gives us nothing as fans.",Spurs,Yes,j71s5jf,t1_j71j3vi

Yeah I think Regui going on loan has more to do with him recovering from his long injuries in his home country than it has to do with Conte not liking him. I think he still has a future here.,Spurs,Yes,j72q3uw,t1_j72luyo
Mmm Perisic was a winger and he went to Bayern and came back to be more defensive to adapt to the wing back role. Reguilon is a defender and he sure ain’t going to get more attacking skills at athletico,Spurs,Yes,j72qbtq,t1_j72luyo

Did he play at the WC? I didn't see him,Spurs,Yes,j72r3wj,t1_j72kq9w
if utilized properly Bissouma absolutely would fit into a title winning team. i'm just not sure if we'll ever deploy him to his strengths,Spurs,Yes,j72aswq,t1_j729iyv

Roflmao. Enlighten me Mr. I know all facts.,Spurs,Yes,j72p7lm,t1_j72ie2h
"Look you and I are saying the same thing. The 35 year journey that you talked about and building the team incrementally is what I agree with and it is what we've done till now. Where you're wrong is the piece below:     

>We are competing in the PL and we are improving the squad, we're just not the best team and don't have the deepest pockets. What you seem to aspire to is being the next Chelsea or Man City which almost nobody really wants deep down. It will be the end of the club in spirit.    

Yes we're not the best team but we could've been. And it doesn't need oil money or 100m signings - KMJ was right there which we slipped on. Similarly, the haggling that we do and miss out on Bruno, Skriniar, Grealish, Porro (almost) has to stop and get the right talent over a second choice in GLC, Rodon, Spence. We waste more money turning over the squad than what we would've spent getting them first time right.    

And I'm not aspiring to be the next Chelsea/Man City. All I'm aspiring for is to win the PL which we should all aspire for.    

As the club motto itself says ""It is better to fail aiming high (PL Win) than to succeed aiming low (Top 4)"". Let's do justice to it please.",Spurs,Yes,j71z69e,t1_j71wkyl
Grip on what?,Spurs,Yes,j71oh91,t1_j71itw5
"I see it as an investment. One loss can be massively useful if it prevents Arsenal from winning the league - every point matters.    

Similarly, a red card is an investment to ensure Porro plays - which ensures we win more from next game onwards. If Emerson continues playing we would lose future matches.",Spurs,Yes,j710bo0,t1_j70zkgq
"I don't want a win which gives them the title. It's as simple as that. Not evry fan has a myopic view around football about ""their club only"" like you.",Spurs,Yes,j7118d7,t1_j710xm9

"I haven't been able to go yet, but from memory a lot of people here generally suggest 2 hours before kickoff. Perhaps earlier, depending on if you want to go to one (or more) of the nearby pubs before heading into the stadium.",Spurs,Yes,j72cta1,t1_j72b07o
Stadium opens 2hrs before kickoff. The shop is on the outside so you'd want to go before passing turnstiles,Spurs,Yes,j72f6q4,t1_j72b07o

We obviously do aim higher than that but we aren’t exactly Bayern Munich competing against a bunch of bums are we,Spurs,Yes,j71ylge,t1_j71xi94
"We do aim higher than that, but very obviously that is the minimum target as it has a huge revenue impact leading to better players (if recruited well).  We can't sign the same quality outside of the CL.  We've known this for nearly 20 years.

Your sanity.,Spurs,Yes,j71ok6g,t1_j71oh91
"But they would be 3 absolutely crucial points if we want to stay in the race for top 4. Sure, I’d rather Arse didn’t win the league but, honestly, considering how the season has been going getting top 4 should absolutely be our priority.

"Collins can get better with that aspect. He's only 21, and in terms of pure defensive prowess, he is amazing.",Spurs,Yes,j72loue,t1_j72le3o

That's exactly what I'm saying. We do try for this but club's ""Top 4 is good enough"" mentality is what stop it from going further. If we aimed higher, we would have leveraged on the Top 4 and not just hired Conte but also upgraded his defence to make us competitive for the title. We just called it in with 2-3 good signings and kick the can to the next window and then to the next. It doesn't even need more money - it just needs more ambition.",Spurs,Yes,j720e9g,t1_j71xu6z

"Lloris and Dier both had very good seasons last year that is undeniable. Yeah they’ve both been shit this season and I agree a top class CB and starting keeper should have been our transfer priorities, not spunking most of the budget on getting a backup striker, but that is down to poor strategy not a lack of trying to improve the squad and aim higher",Spurs,Yes,j722gwj,t1_j72161h

"You have me completely wrong. I never said Emerson should break somebody's ankle nor did I say we should fuck off to EL. IMO We should try to finish as high as possible. My take was only with regard to this specific match.

I never cry about spending enough because we do. I just want our scouting to be better and us to haggle less.

We should be aspiring to get as high as possible - I agree with you on that. But Top 4 is just an imaginary podium that fans have started to be happy with because ENIC keeps using it as their definition of success. Just read their latest reply to THST - all they are showcasing is how they secured European Football in so many years. I mean what difference  did it make other than lining their pockets with more revenue?,Spurs,Yes,j71u0rn,t1_j71tg3e
"I don’t think it’s imaginary when it qualifies you for the top European competition; a competition we should definitely be competing for every season. Short of actually winning the league top 4 is the next goal. We aren’t winning the league this year (obviously, don’t mean to patronise) so top 4 should be our goal",Spurs,Yes,j71vmy4,t1_j71u0rn
"Nah mate. Our goal does not change. Our goal should always be to win every match and finish as high as we can.

">I thought you wanted us to lose against city???

Yes, that's for my own happiness. That shouldn't be the club's goal.

"Biggest shake up to football ownership in years leaked - what it means for your club

- Dodgy owners will be blocked from getting hold of our footie teams under a huge clean-up.

- It would mean the likes of sanctioned Russian Roman Abramovich would be kept out of the Premier League.

- Fans will get a say in running clubs and stop bosses radically changing logos and kits.

- Clubs will fund a regulator which will have powers to ban them from breakaway leagues.

The major shake-up will also:

- Ban greedy clubs from joining a breakaway competition like the European Super League — which triggered huge protests by fans in 2021.

- Tax teams an annual fee to fund the regulator and expose them to breach sanctions.

- Let the regulator raid money from the Premier League to help prop up lower leagues.

- The charter plans to tackle murky moneymen and stop them from getting their hands on our clubs — to defend teams against financial and cultural ruin.

- A new regulator will enforce four tough terms clubs must meet to gain a legal licence.

- Teams must only take part in tournaments that have been approved by the regulator — meaning a ban on “breakaway” competitions such as the proposed European Super League.

- Wannabe proprietors will face robust checks on their “source of wealth”. It means multi-millionaires who cannot prove they amassed their fortune legitimately will not be allowed to complete takeovers.

- This seemingly rules out oligarchs eyeing Premier League sides and grifters who have previously put smaller teams at risk. 

- Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan wants the regulator in place for the 2024/5 season and will formally unveil legislation imminently.
Under the proposals — expected to be signed off by Cabinet shortly — all clubs in the top five flights of English football would need to gain a fresh licence to play from the regulator.

- They would be charged a yearly levy — with richer clubs paying more and small sides less.

- But getting the permit depends on meeting tough criteria, including a rigorous vetting of prospective owners and directors. The regulator would carry out due diligence checks so undesirable investors are prevented from staging a takeover.

- More than 60 sides have gone bust since the Premier League was founded in 1992. 

- The reforms could set ministers on a collision course with clubs resistant to more regulation. 

- The regulator would require clubs to have deep enough pockets to stop themselves going bust — and establish a new code of conduct ensuring financial stability.",Spurs,No,j6wc9h3,t3_10rigkm

"Seems to be a reason that he’s not had a big offer or move yet. Even last summer with just 12 months left on his deal. 

I thought he was excellent against West Ham in the Europa league semis last season.",Spurs,Yes,j6w647y,t1_j6w5uuj
No we shouldn’t. Can do better,Spurs,Yes,j6w6vl8,t1_j6w5uuj
"Delofue is balling at Udinese, he would've been great as a depth option",Spurs,Yes,j6wfaoa,t1_j6wezzx
That lad has had the weirdest career with him constantly dipping in and out the PL,Spurs,Yes,j6wfuwo,t1_j6wezzx
Have you watched Deluefou for Udinese? He would’ve been insane in our system. Extremely creative and press resistant. Kane would feast,Spurs,Yes,j6wfcjl,t1_j6wezzx
"Yeah I loved it, great characters and really gives you a full look at the club like it’s not a PR piece like All or Nothing",Spurs,Yes,j6ybpu4,t1_j6ybjqf
"Best football related media for sure. Well, outside of the matches.",Spurs,Yes,j6ybtq4,t1_j6ybjqf
"As others have said, it's great; it really captures the role that a club has in its community, and not just the on-field product.",Spurs,Yes,j6ywr7m,t1_j6ybjqf

"Scalvini would be great. Only 19 and already a starter for Atalanta and his stats are looking really great - especially for his age. He’s versatile, can play everywhere in a back 3 and even played as a DM here and there. 
But he’s Italian and highly rated. It will be difficult and pricy to get. But not impossible. And if we can spend ~£60m on Richarlison as a backup, Scalvini should be doable.",Spurs,Yes,j6w8prr,t1_j6w4wrj
Actually? Did any reliable source say this? Cuz that would be horrible. He’s extremely raw and has none of the qualities we need in a defender in terms of actual defending,Spurs,Yes,j6w8wo4,t1_j6w4wrj
"Emerson 50/50 but likely. 

Since Sess is English I’d say 98% chance.",Spurs,Yes,j6w244x,t1_j6w169m

"I hope he does and I think he will, barring the bottom falling out over the rest of the season. I believe him when he's said repeatedly that he believes in the project --- he's a lot of things but hasn't ever struck me as a bullshit artist, whatever job he's been in. I also think he would still \*love\* to be the guy to take the club that everyone thinks isn't supposed to be able do it to the top.

Also, while things can change, not sure there's another obvious place to go as another better option right now? He's already done the sabbatical thing and it didn't seem to suit him. Italian NT? Been there, done that and Mancini's still there anyway. Maybe Juve before this mess, but hard to see it now. Can't think of another obvious high profile PL vacancy on the horizon and I think so long as he wants to be managing he wants to be at the center of the European league universe.",Spurs,Yes,j6yfm9e,t1_j6y1x2d
"Yes, I do. We’ve already invested so much into players who fit his style of play, and he’s a proven winner. I genuinely don’t think we’d fair much better with anyone else.",Spurs,Yes,j6y2w7d,t1_j6y1x2d

"I hope he starts using better and more entertaining tactics, so that he deserves to stay.

As things currently stand, I don't think he will stay. Too much distancing himself from the club, no new contract, family still elsewhere. And unless the performances improve, I believe the club will think it may just as well look for a new manager.",Spurs,Yes,j6y9199,t1_j6y1x2d
"I mean quite simply, if we continue playing like shit the rest of the season I hope he goes. If he turns things around and the ""project"" looks like it's working I hope he stays of course",Spurs,Yes,j6zdelr,t1_j6y1x2d
"It's been a long time since we've had a top quality #6 or #8. 

Have had some hard workers (Tainio, Michael Brown), or some players though decent  didn't have the x-factor that we've had in other numbers (Huddlestone, Jenas, Mendes). 

But been decades since we had some true top players in those numbers.",Spurs,Yes,j6yhm0t,t1_j6yewd5
Just won't hit the same in a full stadium,Spurs,Yes,j6xrw3t,t1_j6xqakt
"Yeah what is funny is the parallels between fans at every level, they get a manager who is at least 2 tiers to good for them yet when they have a bad run of games everyone is of the opinion that he has no idea what he's doing and wants the owners to sack him, sound familiar?",Spurs,Yes,j6y0qre,t1_j6xwwop
Can you explain this further? Was cancelo toxic or something?,Spurs,Yes,j6x2sst,t1_j6x2hgb
"> Sampdoria would be paying his wages right?

he's probably getting paid a lot more than he would if he was their player outright, so we're likely helping with a percentage of his wages. Like how we didn't pay all of Bale's wages because they were insane.",Spurs,Yes,j6x8exj,t1_j6wt93r
"Regarding paying his wages. Unclear, probably both clubs contributing. Would be on quite a bit for a Serie A rotation player",Spurs,Yes,j6x9e9w,t1_j6wt93r

What's he done now,Spurs,Yes,j6yxxxy,t1_j6yur0e
"He's among the best we've been linked with when it comes to actually defending, whereas his ball playing stats don't compare to some other targets, although I do think his ability there is a little understated. Ndicka or Kilman would be among my first choices, given there's pretty much zero chance for Gvardiol/Bastoni.",Spurs,Yes,j6z5qz7,t1_j6yy88u

"I want him to, but with only a few days training I doubt it. 

Took Bentancur/Kulu a few games to get their starts.",Spurs,Yes,j6wxh4u,t1_j6wwdkc
"I'd say it's 50/50 at best. Big fixture that he'll have a lot of defensive duties. Lack of system familiarity might be a reason to make his debut start next week, perhaps off the bench this week",Spurs,Yes,j6x95zb,t1_j6wwdkc
Would be really harsh on Emerson who's been good lately. Letting him settle properly until leicester is fine imo,Spurs,Yes,j6wzpmq,t1_j6wwdkc
"I rate Emerson (yes, he doesn't hit a good cross), but I think Porro does go straight in to the starting lineup Sunday. He is match fit. Need to take a risk or two to get back into the top 4. And the supporters will love it.",Spurs,Yes,j6xt7sg,t1_j6wwdkc
You're comparing 2 clubs with completely different financial setups tbf. Comparing us to lpool is a much better comparison. And the difference between us and them sadly is they didn't have ndombele flops.....they got all their bug transfers right for a period and we got all ours wrong.,Spurs,Yes,j6ylajh,t1_j6yhxmj
"Sorry but this is missing the mark.

We can't financially cope with our biggest signings being shit, and you need at least a 50/50 success rate on signings, ours has been far worse until Paratici.  

The Loan/obligation does nothing except keep us good with accounting periods and spread costs between years.  It doesn't give us an out if they are obligations.  

The goal of the board is to grow the club into a commercial beast so that it self-funds top-level investment in the team.  They refuse to bank-roll player investment as if it is their plaything and I am ok with that.  For me the investment level is completely fine and plenty of clubs do far better with less money.  What we really need is to have a proper recruitment strategy and bring some youngsters through.  That's exactly what they said they are focused on.",Spurs,Yes,j6z8ppd,t1_j6yhxmj
Young winger at Sevilla called Gil may be a good shout,Spurs,Yes,j6wacy9,t1_j6w3vb6
"It's a real tricky one. Not Kane replacement tricky, but not far from it imo.

 Kulu is basically a nailed on starter for years to come if he keeps doing what he's doing, and we are not a team constantly directly involved in the title race.

So we can't act like a Man City and bring in Mahrez and Grealish who are happy to play second fiddle to Foden and Sterling for quite a while, because they realize they're winning leagues/strongly challenging for the UCL.

So in my opinion, that takes guys like the above-mentioned Raphinha off the table.

It would have to be a younger player with something to prove, or a veteran looking for one last big gig, but I prefer the first one.

Kudus, Zaniolo after this whole Roma mess (if Conte stays), and Olise being my top 3.",Spurs,Yes,j6w5h0a,t1_j6w3vb6
"It's helpful to have backups with a slightly different style, which gives options from the bench.  Given that Kulu is creative/intelligent/inverted, would be good to have a right footed speed merchant as his backup.",Spurs,Yes,j6w475y,t1_j6w3vb6
Kudus would be good. Suprosed noone went for him in Jan,Spurs,Yes,j6w49tc,t1_j6w3vb6
"Raphina is my ideal choice. He can also play on the left

"I’ve seen so many weird takes from the EnicOuters, but the last week has been the weirdest:

Signing one starting rwb (a key position) and an attacking backup, made this “by far the worst window ever” according to a number of tweeters. 
Also, Conte hasn’t gotten a single player under Enic, is “hung out too dry”, and I’ve now seen three claim that Enic/Levy is what caused Conte’s gallbladder problems. 

I think Levy and Enic have made a number of mistakes. But the current “let’s turn any issue at all into a Levy proble’”, has the opposite effect on me, makes me want to distance myself from any EnicOut posts.",Spurs,Yes,j6xk97s,t1_j6wmg64
What an absolute clown,Spurs,Yes,j6wo7et,t1_j6wmg64
"I think this is exactly the divide -- most people who want ENIC out have only known ENIC, when things were relatively good.

"I really like both of them and really like the pod. I do feel at times though they have slight blindspots. 

Like they were both saying the treatment of Gil was mad in that he'd finally broken into the team and was loaned out. But both just completely ignored the fact Gil had a big story out a week ago saying he was desperate to go home and he didn't like being a rotation option!",Spurs,Yes,j6xhry1,t1_j6xfp2f

Pretty average. He's not really stood out in anyway but he's not been completely awful either. I can't imagine we'll buy him unless it's for a very minimal fee and he drops his wages a lot.,Spurs,Yes,j6wi4xr,t1_j6wg8ki

"Sad more about Doherty the person and less about the player. Yes he wasn’t fantastic but he was very well liked in the locker room, had a level head on his shoulders, and worked hard. Doherty the player definitely wasn’t good enough to be a starting Conte wingback, but Doherty the person deserved a better exit.",Spurs,Yes,j6vybb4,t1_j6vxwl2
"Yeah I respect him and his attitude but these are the kinds of players that need to go, he just isn't at the level required.

Spurs supporters are loyal to a fault, we need to get a bit more ruthless with refreshing the squad",Spurs,Yes,j6vyb2t,t1_j6vxwl2
"I mean yeah outside of that February-April run last year his spurs career has been underwhelming but that during that run he did look great and was a reason we finished top 4. Regardless reasons why spurs fans are upset. 

1. He is friends with Harry. Outside of Eric, Doherty was Harry’s second closest personal friend on the team and losing a player who Harry is close with probably makes our Kane retention chances go down ever more slightly (I know this is stupid, Harry Kane isn’t staying at spurs because he likes a player but I guarantee you this is going through at least a few peoples head)

2. He’s not Emerson 

3. Why do you terminate a player and not sell him it just looked like the club completely mismanaged the situation into terminating a player who wasn’t causing an issue like how many clubs fucking terminate players that are well liked? 

4. The only opportunity he got a consistent run of minutes in his preferred position he looked good. He hasn’t seen consistent minutes this season. 

5. He’s an attacking RWB so looks better emerson

6. He’s not Emerson 

7. Didn’t get a dime for him in the transfer market. 

8. Spurs fans thought we were going to exchange Porro for Emerson and have Porro and Doherty which they were content with, but now we have Porro and Emerson 

9. He’s versatile and looked competent at LWB virtually covering two positions in one player 

10. Spurs fans really fucking hate Emerson",Spurs,Yes,j6vyn38,t1_j6vxwl2
"Not 100% but I'm pretty sure we're all aware of how unspectacular he had been. Just the abrupt nature of his termination caught us off guard. At the end of the day, he hadn't caused any problems off the pitch, had been diligent on the training ground, and always put in a shift while on the pitch. Despite his subpar to below par performances, I think he rightfully deserves to have some fans miss him for these things.",Spurs,Yes,j6vyiji,t1_j6vxwl2
"This feels like trying to find the negatives tbh. Doherty leaving over Emerson- dohertys been terrible this season sk really who cares. To say it out weighs the positives of getting one of the most exciting rwbs in Europe is a stretch. 

Gil leaving instead of moura, neither are particularly great and are most likely stop gaps anyway. Gil didn't want to be here and do cameos off the bench whereas moura loves the club and is happy too. 

Max kilman we were never seriously linked with other than some random ITK on twitter. I wouldn't really be too disappointed with that as its probably not true. Is kilman even really thay good? Certainly not the steps uo that badtoni or Gvardiol or the other ones we were linked too are!",Spurs,Yes,j6w1vxf,t1_j6vuatr
"I do think it was a positive window. Transfers in will have more of an impact than what was lost. We’re not an oil club or owned by some war criminal, think we’ve spent well and looking good for the summer (provided Kane and conte stay)",Spurs,Yes,j6vuq7r,t1_j6vuatr
"I think Lucas being back in training makes the decision easier, he was playing as a wing back in preseason and could play there if needed.",Spurs,Yes,j6w7qgs,t1_j6w6j7y
Think it was because we had too many players out in international loans,Spurs,Yes,j6w9wmq,t1_j6w6j7y
Perisic and Sessegnon have both played on the right this year. Then you've got Lucas and Kulu as emergency options.,Spurs,Yes,j6wbqm3,t1_j6w6j7y

">Have you watched Deluefou for Udinese

Yes, mainly because of Udogie. And yes I have to admit he looks fantastic for them, but I just don't think his game would translate well into how we play this season.

Everything they do is quick, fast movements, counters, and he's the main man that everything goes through. In our system, where he wouldn't be able to hold on to the ball as much, and not have that time and space to create, because Conte wants manny passes around the box, without anyone having the ball at their feet for too long, I think his creativity would lack. Also, even though he's already had stints at Watford and Everton, I don't think he would have a fun time with his size and build.

Also, Danjuma is 2 years younger.",Spurs,Yes,j6wg3ub,t1_j6wfcjl

"If Sess stays we’ll have 4 LBs. I’m guessing Reguilon will be sold this summer. Unless Conte gives Udogie the Spence treatment, I expect Sess to be 3rd option in which I can see him being loaned out",Spurs,Yes,j6w2lzq,t1_j6w244x

"Since the WC he’s been unhappy with the lack off game time, one report was he threatened to leave, and became a dressing room disruptive, then when he found out he wasn’t starting vs Arsenal in the FA Cup he had a training ground bust up with Pep, thus City gave him the green light to move.",Spurs,Yes,j6x3je1,t1_j6x2sst
"Our friend below did a good job of answering, all I’d add is he basically expected to be starting every game, felt entitled to it, and constantly was fighting with Foden who plays on the same flank. 

Basically thought he was bigger than the team and Pep said “okay, you’re out”. It’s the type of move that requires a lot of balls and that brings the team together. It will also usher Foden back into form as the other LBs don’t cut inside as much which allows them to play balls down the line rather than in through the middle where it gets crowded out.

Just really feels like one of those massive decisions s where you flog off one of the biggest players in the team for the benefit of the whole",Spurs,Yes,j6x4lh1,t1_j6x2sst
his wages are also going to be taxed at a much lower rate i believe. wouldn't surprise me if he took a reduction in pay and still made the same,Spurs,Yes,j6xjylf,t1_j6x8exj
Liked and retweeted a tweet in support of Greenwood essentially and then put out a tweet ‘apologising’ if you can call it that,Spurs,Yes,j6yzn2d,t1_j6yxxxy
Only way I could see us get Kilman without paying way over value is if Wolves are relegated,Spurs,Yes,j6z81ge,t1_j6z5qz7
WHAT,Spurs,Yes,j71gtwg,t1_j70htws
Booooooo,Spurs,Yes,j71jksw,t1_j70htws
throw Adele in there and we have a full TEAM! coys,Spurs,Yes,j6wh32w,t1_j6wcusk
"Wikzid, he's a big Nigerian artist performing in our stadium soon",Spurs,Yes,j6wq2eg,t1_j6w7uqs
"How are murderers convicted without victims testifying? 

UK police is filled with rapists. They didn't want to convict one of their own. Mendy, Partey, Greenwood, none of them will go to jail.

In a decent society we would if we stayed in position to the end of the season,Spurs,Yes,j6yioow,t1_j6yid8v
Ake is having a decent season. What happened to Laporte though? Him and Dias looked to be a great partnership.,Spurs,Yes,j6wcugl,t1_j6wc9gp
You don't bench a £42m signing to spare someones feelings ..,Spurs,Yes,j6x3rt3,t1_j6wzpmq
Keita?,Spurs,Yes,j6ynbib,t1_j6ylajh
Liverpool still spends pretty big. They’re even considering going in for Bellingham who will be north of £100mil,Spurs,Yes,j6ymmsc,t1_j6ylajh
And that’s fine. That’s how the club is currently run. Problem is most fans want trophies and unless you’re incredibly well run and lucky that takes spending a lot of money.,Spurs,Yes,j6zc470,t1_j6z8ppd
"Spot on there I think. We’ve done pretty well bringing in versatile players for the front line, I think a good final piece would be a right winger he could double up as a CAM so we can switch formations. Kudus would be insane for this I think.",Spurs,Yes,j6w5qa7,t1_j6w5h0a
Do we not need to take into account that kulu seems to be our one source of creativity this year?,Spurs,Yes,j6w4fil,t1_j6w475y
He’d be so much fucking fun.,Spurs,Yes,j6w4s4b,t1_j6w49tc
No thank you,Spurs,Yes,j6wjnqy,t1_j6wai01

"https://twitter.com/pokeefe1/status/1621120787410456577

POK agrees lmao",Spurs,Yes,j6wrf5z,t1_j6wohzw
"..and the further they push people away from their more extreme views, and more the 2 sides dislike eachother.

These people are literally fracturing our fanbase and hurting the club but they don't see it.",Spurs,Yes,j6xqhat,t1_j6xk97s
"I guess what i see is a lot of people who think we are vastly underperforming, but I don't quite understand where they think we should be? Not sure it's totally realistic to think we can be top2 every season when the Manchester clubs have vastly higher rev and Chelsea spend like drunker sailors.

Of course Enic/football department have made mistakes and every decision that hasn't worked out can easily be picked apart in hindsight, but they have also made a lot of good decisions and it seems we are about where we should be in terms of a club, but I really wanted to open this to a discussion as maybe my view is totally warped by what happened before Enic and maybe revenue is not the biggest determining factor of success?",Spurs,Yes,j6y5u9h,t1_j6y4q7i
"I don't know why I didn't think of that, haha, thank you that's what I was looking for.",Spurs,Yes,j6wy5kt,t1_j6wvusk
Do you know when they changed the match day?,Spurs,Yes,j6zp9se,t1_j6zkd4u
"Oh man, he really does, but I also think people need to appreciate how hard it is for a player to break into the first team. You have to be good enough to get noticed, both technically and physically, but thats not enough because we already have pretty much 2 internationals in every position so you need some luck to even get a run out in the first team, and you need a manager who both suits your strengths, but also has faith in you and will understand mistakes are part of the learning curve and not just bin you for not tracking a man that leads to a goal. But yeah, so many players look good at youth levels but just don’t have what it takes and end up in the lower leagues. But to be honest, a career in league football has to be considered a success, only the 0.01% of people that start make it to the top level.",Spurs,Yes,j6yngxf,t1_j6xxwlv
"and the fact that the only reason Gil played at all is Deki, Richy, Sonny and Lucas were all injured.

When all our forwards are fit Gil is literally 3rd choice at any position he could play",Spurs,Yes,j6y02lv,t1_j6xhry1
Can they put nicknames on their backs?,Spurs,Yes,j6ybrc2,t1_j6yb895
"Do you ever have any nuanced takes? Every player is either absolutely shit like Romero or Udogie or the best player in his position in world football like Dier or Kane. I've never seen you rank anyone anywhere in between. Lenglet is a perfect example of someone who has been bang average, not brilliant but not horrendous.",Spurs,Yes,j6whdkf,t1_j6wgdbs
Absolute shit is proper harsh. But to be sure I think the club will want someone better,Spurs,Yes,j6wgh6f,t1_j6wgdbs
What a moronic comment.  Again.,Spurs,Yes,j6wk838,t1_j6wgdbs
Hard agree the bloke is immobile and doesn’t make use of his excellent passing ability anywhere near enough to be worth using,Spurs,Yes,j6wswz7,t1_j6wgdbs
I'm also shopping via ticket resale sites and am happy to purchase them that way but I figured I'd pursue all avenues. Things come up in life that might prevent someone from going and I wasn't asking for discounted tickets.,Spurs,Yes,j6y4tzw,t1_j6y3mlf
Levy won't pay the wages,Spurs,Yes,j70prcv,t1_j6z4mc2
"Tbf there is not a much better exit for him. He will be playing in CL and fighting for La Liga title every season. Only few footballers could dream of, especially at his age. It ended abruptly yeah, but he is in a great position for the next few years if he impresses Simeone.",Spurs,Yes,j6w07jn,t1_j6vybb4
Didn't read + joke player + shit beard + Emerson clears,Spurs,Yes,j6vzig3,t1_j6vyn38
"Why are you using words like ""subpar"" and ""unspectacular""? He was TERRIBLE",Spurs,Yes,j6w0ggl,t1_j6vyiji
I 90% agree with your points but don't tell me you still hope we would sign anyone like Bastoni or Gvardiol. Let's accept the reality. Kilman is best of the rest which we should've signed and could've signed had we not left the negotiation till the last day.,Spurs,Yes,j6w2b2g,t1_j6w1vxf
"That's true but there's going to need to be some explanation as to why the budget was so low (reported to be £30M at the start of the window, we end up going for 2 loans, one that'll end up around £40M and the other that probably won't be bought out, after having a full season of games and events at the stadium and with leftover money from the summer injection (not 100% confirmed where that money went, maybe they'll come out and say this isn't the case). 

Obviously we don't need to spend money just to spend money, especially if none of our top targets are available, but we didn't get a Kulusevski backup nor a CB and got Danjuma because he was cheap. Extremely concerning if our last summer was just an anomaly and instead this approach continues into future windows",Spurs,Yes,j6vwqch,t1_j6vuq7r
Yeah that’s on Paratici lmao,Spurs,Yes,j6wd4aw,t1_j6wd16v
"Paid off, gaslit, whatever -- it all amounts to the same thing, we all lose",Spurs,Yes,j6xft8z,t1_j6xamg7
"Yeah, tbf at least they conducted themselves pretty well up until now and suspended him while under investigation, as opposed to some other teams.",Spurs,Yes,j6x2mzy,t1_j6x20zn
You’d hope so but football doesn’t have a good track record for this type of situation,Spurs,Yes,j6x2fdz,t1_j6x28do
Could use all the help we can get,Spurs,Yes,j6x2cun,t1_j6wh5fv
Delofe would be amazing,Spurs,Yes,j6wvfbz,t1_j6wujz9
Which player? Delle Allifeu?,Spurs,Yes,j6x26la,t1_j6wujz9
"I think he’d get a lot of the ball in our system given how Conte wants his wingers to drop back deep to collect the ball and turn to spray it out wide. He would do that job perfectly

He’s also very evasive and uses his size to his advantage",Spurs,Yes,j6wggq0,t1_j6wg3ub
"A decent bit. I know Deulefwou cuz I watch Udinese for Udogie

No I do not but I know Doekhi. Spurs played his former team Vitesse in the UECL and he got sent off in Conte’s first ever match for us which happened to be a wild ride cuz Romero also got sent off from our side",Spurs,Yes,j6wi6d1,t1_j6wh8s4
He can play but he plays on he left for Udinese. He would start ahead of Son given how creative he is,Spurs,Yes,j6wfvwy,t1_j6wfr5g
"I’m not saying sessegnon has been better than perisic, but if you think it’s coming down to a 23 year old English LB and a 34 year old Croatian LB for the 25th spot you know who Levy is picking 11 out of 10 times. I could be wrong but even Conte hasn’t clearly favored one over the other this season. I think all three are probably on the team next season with perisic serving as a forward more often when needed and an offensive LWB substitute.",Spurs,Yes,j6w3060,t1_j6w2lzq
Udogie needs to be loaned out for another 2 seasons atleast. He’s extremely raw and very very undeveloped,Spurs,Yes,j6w2zei,t1_j6w2lzq
"You got his shirt already? Lol madlad, hope it’s a good luck charm.",Spurs,Yes,j6yaq02,t1_j6y1vvr
I always think it's odd when players go with a P. Porro or Pedro P. especially when there's not another player that they'd need to do that for. So it would be funny if he just went for the double abbreviation. Shirt sales would be through the roof,Spurs,Yes,j6xo5j3,t1_j6xm2hy
"can't see his philosophy and personality being a fit at Bayern, and would he be interested in cakewalking the BL? not sure. 

who knows with Boehly-Boy, but seems like Potter will get time",Spurs,Yes,j6ym3iw,t1_j6yhxkj
Nah it was beyond funny seeing the team we scored against just look embarrassed with Sandstrom blasting in an empty stadium,Spurs,Yes,j6y70yd,t1_j6y6qct
"You're probably right, although I thought I read somewhere that Wolves were considering selling him",Spurs,Yes,j6z8y12,t1_j6z81ge
"Adele has proper no-nonsense CDM vibes, can fill in at CB if there's injuries",Spurs,Yes,j6ws74g,t1_j6wh32w
"Because murders are much easier to prove than domestic violence?

Mate don’t have a go at me, I’m in complete agreeance that all of them should be in prison. Just stating why the case was dropped.",Spurs,Yes,j6x6kk1,t1_j6x6ekk
Squad management is a big thing in football what are you on about. Also Emerson knows the system and has already proven he can handle city,Spurs,No,j6x42d3,t1_j6x3rt3
"They've had the odd miss but that golden period of theirs Mane/salah/vvd/alison/robertson/wijnaldum

That's just so good. It's not just like Hits, it's like the best player in the league in that position.",Spurs,Yes,j6yo7qd,t1_j6ynbib
"actually considering they are better at selling (See Ndombele flop) they have not spent much more than us over the past decade in net spend, that is skewed a little bit due to them being able to cash in on the Neymar transfer when they sold Coutinho for 150m to barca

In fact according to transfermarakt we have outspent them [https://www.transfermarkt.us/premier-league/fuenfjahresvergleich/wettbewerb/GB1](https://www.transfermarkt.us/premier-league/fuenfjahresvergleich/wettbewerb/GB1)",Spurs,Yes,j6yobds,t1_j6ymmsc
"But then we'd be better with more creativity in a different position.  A creative midfielder and a fast winger gives the option to lean into either option when the squad is in strength.

eg, imagine Chiesa and Maddison.   Seems unlikely both would want to be in a rotation, but that would be amazing.",Spurs,Yes,j6wab36,t1_j6w4fil
This,Spurs,Yes,j6w4kg1,t1_j6w4fil
Why,Spurs,Yes,j736aa7,t1_j6wjnqy
[It seems that it was changed back in December.](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-city-fixtures-tv-tottenham-25677318) I'm sorry about your situation.,Spurs,Yes,j6zx22g,t1_j6zp9se
"Yeah exactly. It wasn't becuase he'd been integrated to the team, he played cos there was noone else, and he left because he didn't want to only play when everyone else was injured",Spurs,Yes,j6y0exa,t1_j6y02lv
"Yeah, that's not unheard of. 

Another one would be Gedson Fernandes had Gedson on the back of his shirt",Spurs,Yes,j6yd2r6,t1_j6ybrc2
"😂😂😂 I give my justifications so my takes are nothing but nuanced

Bang average would be a good way to describe Lenglet if he wasn’t directly at fault for 2 goals. His on the ball skills are lacking too. A great passer for sure but when put under pressure crumbles the fastest

He isn’t good enough for us",Spurs,Yes,j6wi152,t1_j6whdkf
"He's on around 160k right? Doesn't seem undoable to me, but maybe a little high for a backup",Spurs,Yes,j70qi5u,t1_j70prcv
Atletico aren’t even playing europa league. He signed a 5 month contract.,Spurs,Yes,j6w16on,t1_j6w07jn
Someone just + really dislikes + a player + other people + seemed to like,Spurs,Yes,j6w14o4,t1_j6vzig3
Emerson is way worse,Spurs,Yes,j6w9pdx,t1_j6vzig3
"Sure, he was TERRIBLE, at times. It's not that I'm not willing to admit that, I'm just trying to shine him in a more positive light",Spurs,Yes,j6w13fb,t1_j6w0ggl
"As I say all this kilman stuff is just based off ITK, has anywhere reputable reported we went for him at all let alone left it to the last day? 

I think hes solid but there are better LCB out there. For example if Hincapie can keep developing this next 6 months he could over take him, also I still think Bastoni there's a shot if conte stays given how screwed inter are. Bastoni still hasn't signed a new contract",Spurs,Yes,j6w2kis,t1_j6w2b2g
"Tbf to the club we have a manager who won't commit to the club past summer and has openly spoken about how hard it is to spend time away from his family. Would be a bit wild to drop 100m on his players in Jan.

Not to mention Lpool, Newcastle, City all spent the same as us if not less. It looks like our budget was pretty normal tbh as opposed to worryingly low. Chelsea kbvs went mad byt they're Chelsea. And arsenal only spent an extra 10m or so. I know they were throwing around big offers but were they very really going to get thise players? Twice they offered well below the asking price and got repeatedly rejected.",Spurs,Yes,j6w29c9,t1_j6vwqch
"I mean, i get that you mean ""we"" in the societal sense, but she's the one that loses. It takes on average something like 6 attempts to leave an abusive relationship. And this isn't just run of the mill abuse. She's been raped and beaten. 

She's still the victim, we aren;t",Spurs,Yes,j6xismb,t1_j6xft8z
He’s done in the top leagues but there’s no doubt the likes of the Turkish league or Saudi leagues would take him with open arms,Spurs,Yes,j6x6tth,t1_j6x2fdz
And they got their keeper sent off as well.,Spurs,Yes,j6wry8i,t1_j6wi6d1
Totally disagree. He’s been a standout player on a decent Serie A team.,Spurs,Yes,j6w3nhh,t1_j6w2zei
Was him or Bentancur but i thought fuck it!,Spurs,Yes,j6ydu8l,t1_j6yaq02
Really? That's a great option for us then,Spurs,Yes,j6z9te8,t1_j6z8y12
He's on fucking audio. There's a victim with injuries. He violated the law by trying to visit her after being arrested. This is the SA equivalent of a murder case with 1080p video. It's a joke,Spurs,Yes,j6x6ugx,t1_j6x6kk1
and Conte has shown he will start an average player that follows the system every time.,Spurs,Yes,j6xjrsw,t1_j6x42d3
Skewed a lot a bit by coutinho,Spurs,Yes,j6yoqzj,t1_j6yobds
That’s really cool.  Imagining Jordan with the nickname “Air” on his back would’ve been so dope.,Spurs,Yes,j6yd7rq,t1_j6yd2r6
So just because he made 2 mistake he instantly turns from bang average to shit?,Spurs,Yes,j6wl0fu,t1_j6wi152
"He earns close to kane iirc. Too steep for someone with very limited contribution(lack of g/a, weak mentality, more suited to a possession based side)",Spurs,Yes,j70wa3r,t1_j70qi5u
Yeah that’s why I said he has to impress so he could get a new contract.,Spurs,Yes,j6w2rsl,t1_j6w16on
Because + he's + incredibly + incredibly + incredibly + shit,Spurs,Yes,j6w1em4,t1_j6w14o4
"No, not at times. As a whole",Spurs,Yes,j6w1cju,t1_j6w13fb
"I straight up hate Bastoni at this point so even if there is a chance, I don't really care about him.    Hincapie is one to monitor for sure but he's too short to plug our aerial weaknesses.",Spurs,Yes,j6w3xwa,t1_j6w2kis
"Yeah, obviously not downplaying her experience, just underlining that the victim not getting the justice she deserves harms all of us in the long run",Spurs,Yes,j6xjcdu,t1_j6xismb
"Honestly I wouldn’t be so sure, at his age/talent level I really wouldn’t be shocked if a top 5 league team took a punt on him",Spurs,Yes,j6x7cb9,t1_j6x6tth
if they were taking bets i'd put everything I have that he'll end up in the Turkish league. It's probably the best league that has zero qualms about rapists playing in it.,Spurs,Yes,j6xjgro,t1_j6x6tth
"Have you watched them regularly? Cuz I have. And he’s been anything but stand out. He doesn’t track back, he switches off multiple times a game, doesn’t have the technical ability to cross, very predictable - cutting inside all the time.

At the moment he’s a one trick pony in that he can only get in behind. Still needs to develop almost every single aspect of his game",Spurs,Yes,j6w3t2b,t1_j6w3nhh
"Like I said, I agree with you. The justice systems around the world do not work effectively",Spurs,Yes,j6x6zzp,t1_j6x6ugx
"i mentioned that but the narrative that we spend vastly less than Liverpool simply isn't true.

also FSG don't just pump money into liverpool, all money they spend is in the form of repayable loans, this includes the improvements to the stadium, we are run very similar to them",Spurs,Yes,j6yq9gh,t1_j6yoqzj
Well yeah but that was a bussiness decision by them. He was one of their best players and they sold him to buy VVD and Allison. That's just great bussiness from them.,Spurs,Yes,j6yp0bt,t1_j6yoqzj
Sorry but that last mistake was fucking crap. Do you not remember Mahrez? Is that the kind of guy you would describe as bang average?,Spurs,Yes,j6wl4dn,t1_j6wl0fu
What has he actually done to be valued as better than that though?,Spurs,Yes,j6wtpy7,t1_j6wl0fu
"It’s okay at least he’s gone and you won’t have to see him at spurs again, hope you can handle 3 more days of a light Doherty Circlejerk until we play city and the sub will move onto how we either played like shit in a loss or if we get a result how we handed the title to arsenal. Think you can manage :)",Spurs,Yes,j6w1y9q,t1_j6w1em4
Got it 👍,Spurs,Yes,j6w1kw0,t1_j6w1cju
"absolutely, i just wanted to make sure people weren't reading this as disparaging her. the lasting impact this fuckface is going to make on her life is depressing. 

he might not be going to prison now, but something tells me he'll end up there one way or another eventually. you don't abuse and rape like that and just stop without doing some serious fixing.",Spurs,Yes,j6xkxb7,t1_j6xjcdu
"England -- No

Germany -- No

Spain -- No

France - Unlikely

Italy -- Maybe

Who knows though",Spurs,Yes,j6xfbiv,t1_j6x7cb9
"It does seem the most likely

Loads of balkan clubs who would take him I'm sure as well. Russia obviously couldn't give two fucks about rights of any kind",Spurs,Yes,j6xkbhy,t1_j6xjgro
So one trick pony like both of our LBs currently. Perisic is basically a cross merchant who can’t defend while Sess… not even sure what he does well atm,Spurs,Yes,j6w4uzu,t1_j6w3t2b
"He’s 20 years old. Of course he has flaws and improvement areas needed in his game id be shocked if he didn’t. 

Name another defender at that age who has zero flaws to their game and you’ll struggle. As long as they are learning and improving that is all that matters at his age — he’s showing immense promise and hopefully will be a future fullback with Porro.",Spurs,Yes,j6w72oq,t1_j6w3t2b
Think there’s just a different scale with Liverpool. When they identify targets they get them no matter the price point. We don’t operate like that,Spurs,Yes,j6yqtyl,t1_j6yq9gh
"Yes, because bang average players make mistakes sometimes. That's why they're not brilliant.",Spurs,Yes,j6wlbad,t1_j6wl4dn
"Going by the same logic, scored in the UCL to get us out of the group.",Spurs,Yes,j6wudi1,t1_j6wtpy7
No I want everyone to be happy he's gone too,Spurs,Yes,j6w52in,t1_j6w1y9q
Took its time to sink in,Spurs,Yes,j6w1maq,t1_j6w1kw0
"whatever happens to him, I hope the cunt rots",Spurs,Yes,j6xgi5s,t1_j6xfbiv
"Perisic’s one trick is very important to our play style plus he executes it to perfection so getting one trick ponies who can do exactly what he can is beneficial to us

Udogie’s trick is off ball stuff whereas our WB’s need to create with the ball so Udogie is the wrong fit",Spurs,Yes,j6w6ool,t1_j6w4uzu
I literally started by saying he needs 2 more loans. He will be good for us in the future if he develops and that can only happen with play time,Spurs,Yes,j6w7g65,t1_j6w72oq
Scared money don't make money,Spurs,Yes,j70e6aj,t1_j6yqtyl
"If you make a mistake every time you’re pressured you don’t classify as bang average. Just because you don’t concede a goal every time you make a mistake doesn’t mean it isn’t a mistake

Lenglet isn’t the least bit press resistant like I said. Even a little bit of pressure and that’s a possession turn over from his side",Spurs,Yes,j6wmbmr,t1_j6wlbad
"Ah yes the best metric to judge a central defender by, goal(s)",Spurs,Yes,j6wug6l,t1_j6wudi1
So this is what you do with your time. Complain people liked Matt Doherty,Spurs,Yes,j6x5dld,t1_j6w1maq
"Could do worse things - for instance, liking Matt Doherty",Spurs,Yes,j6x5wk4,t1_j6x5dld
Conte has had a pretty shit few months hasnt he,Spurs,No,j6rgqlx,t3_10qm4bu
"Maybe I’m a bit salty here but I think Chelsea are digging their own grave by signing so many over-priced players with an enormous wage.

And it must be a nightmare for Potter to manage, so many big egos in the dressing room.",Spurs,No,j6qyguk,t3_10qm4bu
"Emergod continues his unstoppable reign at the top. Try to stop him, try to even look at him the wrong way -- you will just be another meaningless peon crushed by the force of a thousand no-look passes.",Spurs,No,j6srcmi,t3_10qm4bu
"Laughing so much at imagining Ali trying to record this video.

Sporting agreed to the deal - they reneged - they agreed again

Conte's having his gallbladder out

""One normal day of Tottenham. All I ask.""",Spurs,No,j6rfgyc,t3_10qm4bu
Watching the behind the scenes of the Pedro Porro media announcement video on the Spurs app you can tell that Sergio Reguilón and Pedro Porro would’ve got along real well!! Porro seems so chuffed to make the move to the premier league and play for our club I’m really excited for him and I can’t wait to see Porro make his debut for Spurs!!,Spurs,No,j6r4gn5,t3_10qm4bu
Oh shit champions league in 2 weeks. Snuck up on me,Spurs,No,j6r11ky,t3_10qm4bu
"I wonder how the guy who went to the strip club last night, night went? 😂",Spurs,No,j6r4kfq,t3_10qm4bu
Just gonna say that having to terminate Doherty's contract so he could get his move is infinitely better than leaving him hanging in Atletico's offices having to offer to pay his own money to make a deal work ala Ziyech.,Spurs,No,j6tvb2z,t3_10qm4bu
Conte gall,Spurs,No,j6ryamc,t3_10qm4bu

If Djed had gone on loan in England does that mean Matt would of just gone on loan? Is Djed tactically removing his competition?",Spurs,No,j6sg1dr,t3_10qm4bu

Liverpool fans: ""Jesus, our club is run by amateurs. Just look at last few months. Owners are trying to sell out, but can't do it. Our team has collapsed to 9th, our midfield is old and has collapsed, our defenders are a shadow of who they were - and all we add is another attacker.""  
Chelsea fans: ""Jesus, our club is run by amateurs. Just look at this transfer window. Throwing money around to make us an easily ridiculed by everyone, and topping it by selling our starting DM/playmaker to league rivals.""  
ManU fans: ""Jesus, our club is run by amateurs. Our stadium is falling apart, they're stealing hundreds of millions from the club chest directly into their own bank accounts.""  
ManC fans: ""Jesus, our club is run by amateurs. We're falling behind Arsenal, have plenty of money. But our biggest business is sending out Cancelo, the player who's been perhaps the best fullback and also midfielder over the last few seasons.""

I'm not saying I have any details of Contes surgery, but generally if the procedure was successful the recovery time is usually 1 week for surgery done with laparoscopy or 2-3 weeks if open surgery was required.",Spurs,Yes,j6rg0m7,t1_j6rdbwh
Hopefully he can have a nice break with his wife and daughter as he recovers. I'm confident Stellini can show his steel,Spurs,Yes,j6re8gr,t1_j6rdbwh

"I think it'll be pretty straightforward we know they've already identified the targets. 

At a guess it will be 

In

HG Gk in (raya/pickford/hendo)

LCB- Bastoni/Kilman/hincapie

CCB (also covers rcb) - no idea on this one tbh.

Another attacker if Danjuma doesn't stay. 

Out

Sanchez, maybe sess, and then all the loan army (regi Glc ndombele winks)

|LWB|Sessegnon^(HG)|Udogie ✔|

Because noone outside the prem has any money.....but everyone in the prem has seen they aren't particularly good.,Spurs,Yes,j6r3n0j,t1_j6qwgij
"Prem league wages. Why would a player like Ndombele accept a lower wage to play in Italy when he can just be loaned out to play in Italy and still get Kane wages. 

They have all the leverage because the club is desperate to get rid of them. So even a loan/termination works. The player still gets his contract money and gets to play football. Its a win win for them to refuse any transfers and force a loan/termination",Spurs,Yes,j6s0cv1,t1_j6qwgij
"Normally we put a ridiculous fee on their head that European clubs can't afford. We turned down permanent sales for Ndombele and Lo Celso in the summer.

"I don't think people are actually upset about the money that we missed out on. I think it's about letting him go like that all of a sudden on deadline day because of a technicality. 

And he was of course very likeable, plus add to the fact that we all wanted him to play instead of Emerson, and even though he has a bigger audience for future sales due to his age, everyone wanted to see Emerson's back, not Doherty's.

Plus add to the fact that he was best mates with Harry and Dier.

And then, there is of course the post-match interview  he did last year after one of our wins where the journalist asked him something along the lines of do you see yourself leaving any time soon, to which he replied: ""Why would I want to be anywhere besides Tottenham?""

I think people on the sub are frustrated by the combination of the above named circumstances, not the potential money we could've gotten for him.",Spurs,Yes,j6r5w50,t1_j6r4tin
"I liked him very much, seems to be a really nice bloke. His actual spell at RWB was very good, shame it lasted so short. Is it best for both parties?

Yes, yes I am",Spurs,Yes,j6rc1i1,t1_j6r4tin

"I mean he's only just 31, we might as well be accurate.

I don't think we know about the situation yet to respond either way, but terminating contracts is pretty unusual (I can only recall doing this with Aurier in recent years) and suggests a lack of proper planning or joined up thinking. It's not so much about Doherty as an individual - we'd need to shift him sooner or later - it's just indicative of usual activity, which could be fine, but without knowing the circumstances that brought it about (and I doubt we ever will) I think it's pretty normal for fans to raise an eyebrow.",Spurs,Yes,j6r7809,t1_j6r4tin
"How can anyone not moan about selling the 2nd best WB at the club after Perisic (before Porro) and keeping an actual amateur who offers nothing offensively as backup to our extremely attack minded RWB?

"We improved our first eleven by a lot, how often do people think that happens in January?",Spurs,Yes,j6sgmmt,t1_j6sg9m9
Still think that not addressing CB was a mistake. I’d say around a 5 or 6 out of 10. Could always end up being better if Porro completely changes how the squad plays,Spurs,Yes,j6skp95,t1_j6sg9m9
In a way. We have so much deadwood (like the Doherty debacle proved) that getting the unquestionable correct players in is better than going for gambles. Like #1 RWB target is much better than settling for whatever cb we could get a deal for,Spurs,Yes,j6sgvwg,t1_j6sg9m9
"For now, yeah. Time will tell if not getting a CB is going to cost us or not.",Spurs,Yes,j6sloju,t1_j6sg9m9
Porro is huge but getting rid of his first choice back up and not signing a Kulu backup are horrible decisions,Spurs,Yes,j6sj5fv,t1_j6sg9m9
"If porro makes the system click then I’d say yes.

"It's precisely why I think it's bullshit that people bludgeon Kane with the ""no trophies"" garbage incessantly.  Kane is one of the greatest footballers of all time - regardless of whether his team has won trophies in knockout tournaments.

World Cup Golden Boot Winner. 

National Team Captain. 

Spurs All-Time Goal Scorer. 

England National Team All-Time Goal Scorer. 

Likely to become Premier League All-Time Goal Scorer. 

Won Golden Boot AND Playmaker Award in Same Season.

More like they didn't plan to be over the limit because Spence demanded playing time at Rennes?

If you want to reflexively call everything they do stupid, I get it, but in this case I don't really see the issue. Doherty is probably worth less than his wages if we're stuck with him and isn't a long-term keeper.

Having said all of that, I still can't believe we left so much business for the end and only brought in 2. Should've just paid the release clause for Porro. All of this about their league cup game, I don't believe it. No one cares about that trophy. It doesn't qualify you for Europe or anything.",Spurs,Yes,j6t8e08,t1_j6soijl

"I don't know why you're getting downvoted; fair question even if your position is pretty much straight down the middle for this sub.  


I do think this would be the summer to finally start moving players on who aren't going to make it to the level required - definitely Tanganga and Sessegnon, possibly Gil (though I still think he's worth keeping attached to the organization, either via loan or a favorable buy-back clause), and (unfortunately) send Lloris to play with all the other dogs at ~~that nice farm upstate~~ in Nice.

"kind of unfair to a good winter window for United.

They filled the two spots they were left in dire need of filling, and got two very good quality players to slot in. That's kind of the point of a winter window.

This was probably his last big chance (older, Conte wasn't going to play him), and he's been a model pro for us (regardless of the debate of his on pitch return)

Like, if someone got banned for dodgy dealings in any sector or industry, would you want to enter into dealings with them? I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with it.

It's complicated though as I believe he brought a number of new members of his scouting/recruitment team. Do they stay? Would a new DoF want them? Do we even stick with the DoF model? It's a real mess and I want to know more about the whole thing.",Spurs,Yes,j6rc275,t1_j6r69xa

Don* . Only Paratici is stupid. And who cares about the loan shit it’s about how we still have Emerson at the club while letting go of a WB who’s miles better and can somewhat backup Porro offensively speaking while Emerson can’t hold a candle to what Porro can do,Spurs,Yes,j6r6ohc,t1_j6r508o
"actual amateur?  what are you talking about?

toxic ignorance at its best.  I would assume you're new, but I suspect it is more insulting than that and you're not new, you just come across like it with your weird mindless comments on every thread.

Doherty has been absolute rubbish for 3 years and I get to see this from my side, aside from that purple patch he had for a short time.  I am delighted to get the wages off the books given we have 8 senior players out on loan already, 6 of whom need to be sold.",Spurs,Yes,j6r85mq,t1_j6r6lmu
"He's been terrible this season and doesn't look like he's got over his injury. Emersons been better than him this season, and offers a different option to Porro who isn't great defensively.

"From what was reported, Emerson was refusing to go elsewhere. I’m not sure if he’s on higher wages or has a longer contract than Doc so they couldn’t terminate Royal’s contract, but if it came down to a choice between not getting an upgrade at RWB and terminating Doc’s contract, I think most fans would agree that upgrading is more important.",Spurs,Yes,j6rp2nr,t1_j6r6lmu
"Yeah, I wonder if some people have lost perspective on how last year was truly an amazing January for us based on the value and quality we bagged.

Im curious who we could have potentially even gotten. But agree we desperately need an upgrade here,Spurs,Yes,j6vs7iw,t1_j6sloju
You may very well disagree with Conte but it's perfectly clear by now that Emerson was preferred to Doherty this season. Also even besides Emerson we have sooo many makeshift RWB cover options. It's literally the least concern area of the squad,Spurs,Yes,j6skjy9,t1_j6sj5fv
You may not personally like it but Doherty has made 40 PL appearances in 2 1/2 seasons so he was definitely 3rd in the pecking order.,Spurs,Yes,j6sp3zd,t1_j6sj5fv

"Yeah, basically. Explains the whole situation and the timelines and how stuff was going on internally. They essentially didn't realize until the last minute that they couldn't loan out Doherty, hence the reason for terminating his contract.

"Man I'm not sure either, considering this is the *daily discussion* thread but oh well.

Reguilon on paper does not seem like bad cover at LB even with Udogie next season I guess we'll have to see how this season pans out for everyone. Spurs surely need adequate depth at fullback next season especially if Conte stays.",Spurs,Yes,j6shk4e,t1_j6s2p5g
"I actually feel like terminated contracts are going to become more common for PL sides, the transfer fee's and wages that are being given are so out of whack with the rest of football it's going to be very hard to sell players going forward unless finances take a big upturn in Europe, and with the new loan restriction rules it's going to be very difficult to clear out players",Spurs,Yes,j6s38a4,t1_j6ryjup
Lol idk why you're moaning over paratici when you have to tolerate him for a month more at max. Even then you can't deny there's just no money outside pl.

"They got Butland, Weghorst, and Sabitzer on loan.

If the tables were turned, and that was our window, I don't think people would be saying the same - that is the hypocrisy I mean.

"I do kinda understand the 'at least he can defend' argument, but from my point of view, Emerson isn't defensively solid enough to make up for his extreme lack of quality in attack.

"I saw better link-up between Deki and Doherty tbh. I also appreciate his hard work and his determination to improve himself, but that's not good enough I'm afraid. I know that sounds really harsh but I just don't see anything else that shows he can get much better.",Spurs,Yes,j6rh7ck,t1_j6remd6

">It's funny that for a year the main problem was RWB

Not for me it wasn't. I didn't think either Doherty or Emerson were complete liabilities. Sure, they should be upgraded, but that was never our main problem.

We may have some problems in an attacking sense from the RWBs, but they weren't singlehandedly costing us games.

Again, we have problems going forward, but we still have great attacking numbers and options.

Now, look at teams like Man Utd and Newcastle. They aren't prolific goalscoring teams, but have a great defensive structure with their new signings and their results are better for it.

A good team **always** start with good defenders. We don't have that, so **hopefully** our star forwards can make the difference.",Spurs,Yes,j6rjwv5,t1_j6riq1g

We need to get DOF’s who are good on a budget,  the Atalanta dude would be perfect",Spurs,Yes,j6r8jhv,t1_j6r8dw5
"Our defenders can be coached to do a good enough job to fit the system, we've seen that last year. I'm not sure what happened this year, whether Lloris shitting the bed had a domino effect on the entire backline, or whether the coaching has not been up to par, but even a good defender like Romero who has been solid for Argentina has had plenty of bozo moments for us.

Emerson, while I do like him and think he's a solid fullback, can not be coached to be a Conte wingback.",Spurs,Yes,j6rl6zt,t1_j6rjwv5

Hope someone else does the scoring instead",Spurs,Yes,j6rwtja,t1_j6ru7mj
"Doesn't mean they don't get their head turned.

Brighton have got a good chance of reintegrating Caicedo back into the squad atm cos he's nowhere else to go, they wouldn't if Chelsea/Arsenal could just keep pumping bids at them.",Spurs,Yes,j6rmeau,t1_j6rm5tq
It means nothing about the level we have been at is a product of just showing up. Being in the champions league is a product of them getting some of the big decisions right when it comes to football.,Spurs,Yes,j6sr9am,t1_j6sqzis
"Legit Perisic may be Kulu rotation if Udogie hits the ground running, good point. And yeah I think Kulu depth is bottom of the pile, CBs and GK are priority for sure, midfielder somewhere in the middle",Spurs,Yes,j6ri7kp,t1_j6rhvyd
"He really wasn't playing well at RW, with Danjuma I think Conte sees him as LW or striker.

Either way, RW is bottom of the priority list, particularly if deki stays fit",Spurs,Yes,j6s7jf2,t1_j6s6men
"What potential? Potential to have a record number of failed crosses? Yes. Potential to be the bigger black hole than the actual one in attack? Yes.

Doherty had a run of 5 games where he was world class last year and then got a ligament injury. Emerson has had a grand total of 0 games where he showed anything close to what Doherty did even though he’s played more than double the games Doc did

What are you even saying?",Spurs,Yes,j6r8aj3,t1_j6r83z5
"Yes so we have saved £5m.  Surely you should be delighted so that next time you're saying ""Uuunnggg Levy just pay the extra £5m, uuuurrgggh Paratici doesn't know what he's doing, agggh ENIC haven't backed Conte"" etc at least you know there is some extra money there.",Spurs,Yes,j6r9ms6,t1_j6r8bzv
"Dohertys been rubbish bar a half against Everton and a half against Palace. Emerson has had as many good games this season.

For the squad Emerson can offer a good defensive option. Doherty can't offer anything apart from just being a much worse porro",Spurs,Yes,j6rqwt3,t1_j6rq2wg
"Because that's how you build a good squad with different options. 

You don't just have two identical players in every position? 

Richarlison doesn't play RW? That doesn't make any sense",Spurs,Yes,j6r8bs3,t1_j6r7sjl
HAHAHAHAHAHA thanks for a laugh,Spurs,Yes,j6usljv,t1_j6uh07r
"Alright Jay from the inbetweeners

Or just some investors who we've got heavily linked with in the press were shown around the training ground several times and the players saw/met them. And, you know, matt doherty is a player and has eyes and ears and a mouth so would be aware of it and talk about it. 

And BTW Joe Lewis daughter is going to inherit all her dad's portfolio when he dies/steps back, the paperwork for it has already begun, and she will be the new owner, probably withing 12 months. So yeah I'd imagine she's pretty clued up on stuff. And she's a family friend of the Kanes. 

So really to answer your question. Of course players will be aware of lots more things than are out in the public. Pretty mad to think otherwise.",Spurs,Yes,j6w1d66,t1_j6uh07r

"You conveniently excluded the part right above that where I said ""understandable but incompetent.""

Right but the massive difference is I'm actually using real information reported by real journalists and not digging shit out of my anus and presenting it as reality,Spurs,Yes,j6spu5p,t1_j6sphd9
It's pretty mad that they probably will be 20 points ahead of us after 21 games. I think that really gets under my skin. They've played good football which is even more annoying.,Spurs,Yes,j6ujv5o,t1_j6u4adp
"One of the last things i ever want to see is Arsenal winning the league, but this is the first time it isn't bothering me that much. Of course I hate it, but they are doing it the right way and fending off oil money clubs to get the title.  They did it the right way, which makes it slightly less nauseating.

would still rather see an oil club take the title from them though",Spurs,Yes,j6un3i9,t1_j6u4adp
"They do - reddit and twitter are awash with Spurs fans claiming we didn't ""act like a big club"", yet none of these so called ""big clubs"" acted like one.",Spurs,Yes,j6z8in2,t1_j6yyl41

Even just as an apology for messing him around,Spurs,Yes,j6sft7l,t1_j6sezd6
"I mean, Doherty had twice as many goals and quadruple the amount of assists in half the appearances compared to Emerson. If you find that statement controversial, football isn’t for you.",Spurs,Yes,j6rozcu,t1_j6rm5y8
"Not really. Saying Doherty is competent in attack isn't as outlandish as saying Emerson is good defensively and will be a vital player for us. Plus, Emerson was booed by the crowd a couple of times whilst Doherty was never given that sort of treatment. I think most people would agree that Doherty, even if he wasn't great, is better than Emerson.",Spurs,Yes,j6s60ul,t1_j6rm5y8
"Funny how they were thrilled to pawn him off and even his mate Nuno Haram didn't want shit to do with him. ""Ooh look at me I can run behind the defence"", zero ability on the ball or defensively. Emerson, Spence>>>>>>>",Spurs,Yes,j6rx77g,t1_j6rwltn
">Our defenders can be coached to do a good enough job to fit the system

The problem this season is that we are trying to press high. Last season we kept compact in a mid/lower block and had some incredible counters, but struggled to create against low-blocks, but that was a lot better than this season.

The pressing this season is highlighting our lack of individual quality at the back. And it's not only the CBs who panic when isolated. Sess and Perisic aren't able to deal with 1v1s.

>Romero who has been solid for Argentina has had plenty of bozo moments for us.

Yes he did. But not like Dier, Sanchez or Lenglet. And even if we had peak Sergio Ramos instead of Romero playing with the likes of Dier and Sess, he would also make mistakes.",Spurs,Yes,j6ror5s,t1_j6rl6zt
Of course but can't see them doing it yet. Timing wouldn't make sense.,Spurs,Yes,j6rehx1,t1_j6rea12

Sure going to be an Interesting one!,Spurs,Yes,j6riffw,t1_j6ri7kp
What are you saying brother? That you’d keep an unhappy 31 year old over a younger more valuable player that offers a different skill set to the player you’ve just signed? Calling Paratici stupid for making the most logical decision. Be happy we’ve got Porro he’s a significant upgrade on Doherty we won’t miss him,Spurs,Yes,j6r90lr,t1_j6r8aj3

"Unhappy? No signs of Doc being unhappy. I would rather keep a capable 31 year old RWB who has offensive prowess than a young player who isn’t an RWB and offers absolutely nothing going forward, yes.

I am happy we got Porro but why are we getting rid of Doc when the whole point of Paratici’s job is to build a squad, not just the main 11. Who is an actual backup to an offensive RWB like Porro in this squad?",Spurs,Yes,j6rbfnt,t1_j6r90lr
"He does though. And has played pretty well in several games, especially ones against the bigger teams where we just need a defender....

So you could say....he's a good defensive options against big teams who might expose Porros defensive weakness",Spurs,Yes,j6r96z6,t1_j6r8dot
He couldnt even get the ball..we were completely dominated in both games by much superior teams,Spurs,Yes,j6rudwj,t1_j6rsvfc
"The fact of the matter is you weren't in the room, and you actually have no idea what really happened. It's a convenient, click-generating narrative that the £4B business operation is a total shambles and made an administrative fuck up by being completely caught off guard about this rule around loan limits that has always been there. Especially a business that operates heavily in player loan deals. I personally am highly skeptical of these suggested ""facts"" and lean to believe this was a result of calculated moves elsewhere to make everything work. Besides, like it or not, Doherty is the wrong side of 30 with history of a serious knee injury, and was third choice. This is called making a difficult, correct decision.

"I think you are missing my point.  There's a difference between people thinking we need to do better and exemplifying that by showing that 'better' is possible.

There is, however, a difference between saying that we should do better, when that definition of better is nearly impossible.  It's toxicity, and something you see from people who have the 'yeah, but' philosophy about the club.

Do you think Emerson with his 31 appearances compared to Doherty’s 15 hasn’t played similarly terrible teams? There are zero stats that say Emerson is a competent wingback.,Spurs,Yes,j6rrt6g,t1_j6rrd38
"Pawn him off cause he had one decent fluke season and was already massively declining and Semedo is a massive upgrade. Doherty's ""run of form"" was a couple weeks accidentally being in the right place, I guess Conte loves him so much Emerson has always been ahead in the pecking order and Doherty is now being disregarded like dinner scraps lmao. RWB Davinson Sanchez that one time he did it >>>>>> Kane's golf buddy",Spurs,Yes,j6rzb04,t1_j6ry8ft
"We getting rid of Doherty because Spence is on loan for 6 months, Doherty won’t have the same resale value as Emerson in 6 months. Whose to say anyone came in for Emerson now? But maybe in 6 months we recoup most of the fee seeing as he’s been in better form. Next year hopefully spence is our competition for Porro. I’m surprised you can’t see this is the logical solution, Doherty has been injured a lot recently and Emerson hasn’t. Doherty is an average player and not exactly a vocal experienced voice to keep and build a squad with sorry but that’s my opinion.",Spurs,Yes,j6rfgvj,t1_j6rbfnt
"Playing there doesn’t mean he can play the role or he’s a natural at it.

And how have you not realised we don’t play that system anymore, we didn’t rely on our WB’s so much last year because Kane dropped deep and Son made runs in behind. It’s not the same this year meaning our WB’s including Emerson would have to be the source of creativity. And we all know how fantastic he is at creating chances for others so having him as the backup is the worst thing possible",Spurs,Yes,j6rbaar,t1_j6r96z6
"That's absolutely not true.

"“Accidentally being in the right place” translates to showing great vision, positioning and distribution to get 6 GA in 5 games as opposed to Emerson who has 4 GA in two years lmaoo

Wonder where Emerson was when Doc was starting continuously during this run. He was neither injured nor unavailable so where was Conte’s love then? Or are you confusing Conte having no choice but to start an incapable footballer at RWB because his first choice sustained a ligament injury in the knee for Conte “loving” Emerson

Doherty supposedly being disregarded now except last I checked he has more starts than Emerson last month. Conte is just shit at ‘disregarding’ eh?

Hugo Lloris at RWB >>> man picked up from the streets of Azerbaijan",Spurs,Yes,j6s14gk,t1_j6rzb04

"Not at all.  My point is people are asking why we aren't ""acting like a big club"", when it's a fictitious state they are defining.

None of the so-called ""big clubs"" have been acting like ""big clubs"".  The behaviour people are expecting hasn't *actually* existed for a number of years -certainly pre-Covid, if you put aside Chelsea spending 8 years worth of players in a random manner.
