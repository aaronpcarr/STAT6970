Secondly, I will be in London the weekend of February the 24th through the 27th during which Tottenham will play Chelsea at home. I don't want to make another post over how to buy tickets as a foreigner (I've read previous posts and understand how to do so) so just want to clarify some things before I proceed.  
  
I wanted to see if anyone could clarify for me that if I purchase a One Hotspur membership today what my chances of securing a ticket through Ticket Exchange for the game against Chelsea would be. I understand that on the website it says that tickets are sold out (I just saw this today) but this will likely my only chance in the near future to watch a Tottenham home game live.  
  
I hope this question is not annoying or a repeat of what others have asked in the past but I would seriously appreciate some guidance, as if it is still possible for me to attend this game I would purchase the One Hotspur membership today but just don't want to spend the money without more guidance for a single weekend I will be in London.

We should really win all those tbh. West ham are really poor and Chelsea are trying to bed in a whole new team.,Spurs,Yes,j7cot18,t1_j7cnxcu
"Argentina? No.

Brazil? No.

Spurs shutting out City? YES!",Spurs,Yes,j7cdl15,t1_j7c5pct
All talk of a generous run is just fluff. It's literally just short of half the season to go,Spurs,Yes,j7cc7n2,t1_j7c94fv
"I think united and newcastle are gonna drop into 5th and 6th, we could get top 4 if we go on a run, hell maybe we could finish 3rd.

 I wouldnt be suprised if chelsea sneak in to top 4 or a europe spot as well bc brighton and fulham are gonna start dropping points soon and go into midtable",Spurs,Yes,j7c9xsv,t1_j7c94fv
"fr, we can't really afford to care about who wins the title. we need top 4, competition is tough, we need every point we can get.",Spurs,Yes,j7a72kn,t1_j7a2gqm

Run it up!,Spurs,Yes,j7cgioj,t1_j7alvr1
he is such a versatile player it's amazing. can't be anywhere near as dim as he comes off to have such a high pitch IQ,Spurs,Yes,j7byhiz,t1_j7brdkr
They had fucking Ramon Vega saying it on the radio lol,Spurs,Yes,j7ddyf3,t1_j7da5wr
"50/50

POK has Royal starting and i'm inclined to agree",Spurs,Yes,j7a8owj,t1_j7a8dd9

Excited for a cheeky Porro cameo at the end though.",Spurs,Yes,j7a8k4e,t1_j7a8dd9
"If it was against a lower league team yeah, but against city, it's not going to happen I think",Spurs,Yes,j7ab147,t1_j7a8dd9
"Originally I thought no chance, but since Stellini is in charge now instead of Conte so maybe 50/50",Spurs,Yes,j7a8xmh,t1_j7a8dd9

I'd expect not,Spurs,Yes,j7b6brw,t1_j7a8dd9
EMERSON MASTERCLASS,Spurs,Yes,j7c2klu,t1_j7c25kb
Yep. Best footballing weekend in such a long time. And you‚Äôll get Kyrie on top of it??,Spurs,Yes,j7c6hs9,t1_j7c504q
Casemiro red was pretty soft.,Spurs,Yes,j7c8z6e,t1_j7c504q
"Can't help you with any concrete advice since I'm also foreign and have never been to a game, but my only suggestion would be posting this tomorrow earlier in the day. Not many people check the daily discussion at 11pm because, well because it's the end of the day. Plus after that match all everyone wants to talk about is Emerson/Kane.",Spurs,Yes,j7d7tjw,t1_j7ccw37
as in doing well?,Spurs,Yes,j7cx0cp,t1_j7cvrl5
They're still upset martial was sent off for slapping Lamela any time that incident comes up,Spurs,Yes,j7arsst,t1_j7apmyg
"My united fan mates argument was essentially ""yeah but casemiro got hit In the melee as well"" as if all players don't know the moment you raise your hands you're having an early shower",Spurs,Yes,j7apui0,t1_j7apmyg
Some of the world's most deluded fans created and molded by Howard Webb. I stg he carried Man United out of relegation battle for so long.,Spurs,Yes,j7axj85,t1_j7apmyg
"I don't think his commitment has every been questioned. This was a great match for him - he's solid defensively, fast on the break and can play simple passes. In a counter-attacking match like that, the opposition team play directly to his strengths. I don't think there's any coincidence that his best matches this season have come against City.

Hopefully he can take confidence from matches like that and we can play to his strengths when he's on the pitch. Between him and Porro we may be able to cover both sides of a wingback's roles, depending on what suits the match better.",Spurs,Yes,j7cd3n9,t1_j7cb93g
"Just thinking exactly the same. Fucking love Spurs and Harry so much. I cannot understand why the guy gets any stick from other fans. He‚Äôs an incredible player for club and country, one of the best in recent history. Most importantly though he‚Äôs a genuine, humble, kind and decent guy and an awesome role model for young kids.",Spurs,Yes,j7ckbj0,t1_j7chyia
meee :‚ÄôD,Spurs,Yes,j7d1rhj,t1_j7chyia
any video for it? haha,Spurs,Yes,j7cb1ny,t1_j7c9mbv
"Our pressing really has started actually getting quite good. It's obvious we've been practicing it, and we're pretty terrible at it at the start of the season. 

It can be hit and miss but its actually starting to be quite effective now.",Spurs,Yes,j7d55ig,t1_j7cav5g
"As someone who went to school during the peak Wenger years, yeah it sucked. I wasn't pathetic enough to ever want us to lose though. Also, do these people still go to school or what?",Spurs,Yes,j7c712g,t1_j7c5yj1
Stellini you mean,Spurs,Yes,j7ceqen,t1_j7ce4x2
they should be more clinical in attack. twice now gnonto has created big chance and both have been missed due to lack of concentration/bad touches.,Spurs,Yes,j7b8hx1,t1_j7b61kd
"That one counter with Son driving ahead, it was Romero and Kane making the goalscoring run.",Spurs,Yes,j7c6xnv,t1_j7c0yyu
Adding in Hugo as well,Spurs,Yes,j7c4gtx,t1_j7c3uw6
">None of that draw bullshit which helps no one

TIL, points don't help anyone...",Spurs,Yes,j7a7pmu,t1_j7a5rbk
Man City won the league by one point in the 18/19 season (98) to Liverpool‚Äôs 97. But yeah I guess that one point from a draw means nothing,Spurs,Yes,j7aemss,t1_j7a5rbk
He had a great game today but a LOT of mistakes have crept into his game recently. He's a good keeper but not been better than Donnarumma,Spurs,Yes,j7bskbe,t1_j7b9adw
"Lack of conte time would be a factor, I imagine",Spurs,Yes,j7agfde,t1_j7af70z
"Emerson hits his form of his life, I bet that he has never played this well before. Pedro Porro walking into this starting 11 might've had something to do with it.",Spurs,Yes,j7akz5f,t1_j7af70z
"Spence because they have no RBs. Cancelo is a better comparison - but really Conte just doesn't work like this, that's the real reason if he doesn't start today. 

Casemiro didn't start for ages at United iirc",Spurs,Yes,j7b65jb,t1_j7af70z
No... We don't want new manager bounce for Milan. 1:0 Inter is enough.,Spurs,Yes,j7ceqau,t1_j7cdezu
"Even if they get a cash injection there‚Äôs no way they can afford Conte and his signings

Conte‚Äôs going nowhere",Spurs,Yes,j7cervy,t1_j7cdezu
Yeah exactly. I want us to win but it won't be as annoying if we lose as it usually would. People actually hoping we lose from the off are mad.,Spurs,Yes,j7an3pq,t1_j7ady0q
"That's the thing. If you're supporting a team, you should always want them to win.

_If_ we lose then helping city against arsenal is something we should take as a positive from the game, but it's not something we should be actively cheering for before the game.",Spurs,Yes,j7alp5p,t1_j7ady0q
They're probably already down the pub - luckily they don't need a booking for a table of under 6.,Spurs,Yes,j7aqazq,t1_j7aq6o7
What was the point of an 11am protest? Who's there to see it,Spurs,Yes,j7b4zrf,t1_j7aq6o7
I don't know if I want to see Perisic vs Mahrez round 2. Would probably prefer Sess to start,Spurs,Yes,j7aufdr,t1_j7auaj9
Perisic??,Spurs,Yes,j7auto3,t1_j7auaj9
I‚Äôd rather see Emerson on the left before Perisic against Mahrez again,Spurs,Yes,j7awrc6,t1_j7auaj9
He did a lot more than get fouled today to be fair.,Spurs,Yes,j7c7ax9,t1_j7c6pts
Grealish would've been incredible with Poch,Spurs,Yes,j7cjmnn,t1_j7c6pts
"Nothing in particular, but all over the pitch we just played better. More desire to win aerials, 2nd balls, making runs.

It's like we had 2nd half Spurs for the whole game, and it was glorious.",Spurs,Yes,j7dgret,t1_j7csif3
Poll: Would you like a separate sub for all the weirdos who can't stop whinging about Arsenal all the time? Y or N.,Spurs,Yes,j7dhxuw,t1_j7dgce7
Is he suspended for a second yellow? I thought it was only straight reds that carry additional suspensions,Spurs,Yes,j7c5ir1,t1_j7c3wg3
Is it from the montage of his celebration that Spurs had up on the big screens?,Spurs,Yes,j7cd8ma,t1_j7c991r
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,Spurs,Yes,j7aw5m8,t1_j7av2ge
"I want us to win every game we can, especially today, obviously, but I‚Äôd rather we finish 5th and they finish 2nd.",Spurs,Yes,j7b28ag,t1_j7avf6r
Locals will always have a different perspective. I have a lot of gooner mates.. god forbid they win the league.,Spurs,Yes,j7aznee,t1_j7avf6r
Plastics try to understand what a rivalry is challenge,Spurs,Yes,j7b1jjf,t1_j7avf6r
"Everything but Arse winning the league. If it requires us to take the L today, so be it. It works both ways you know, just like City aren't out of the title race if they lose today, we aren't out of top 4 race either.",Spurs,Yes,j7bemou,t1_j7avf6r
"Kvicha wouldn't work for us, the reason he's so good for Napoli is because he's starting for them every game, for us he'd be a benchwarmer who only gets 10-15 minutes per game once Conte finally subs Son off. Not getting KMJ is a criminal mistake tho, and I'm afraid the chance to sign him is gone for good. He will go to a better club in summer, or simply stay at Napoli where he has a good chance for another scudetto next year.",Spurs,Yes,j7beazm,t1_j7b2699
We didn't have Emerzinho.,Spurs,Yes,j7c7lpp,t1_j7c7axu
"I genuinely think both city and arse will start dropping more points more regularly. Its a long long season and as we showed today and Everton even more so yesterday, if you sit in and be compact it's harder and harder to break teams down as energy levels fall and fall",Spurs,Yes,j7cq8ww,t1_j7clnmo
"Literally thought about it yesterday when I watched him against Roma. Wanted to suggest it here, but I thought I'd get laughed at because people don't know him. He was also on bayern's shortlist for this January.",Spurs,Yes,j7af3fy,t1_j7ab9uu
"I know nothing about the guy. 

Where does he excel/what are his deficiencies?",Spurs,Yes,j7aingw,t1_j7ab9uu
I was taking a shit and missed it. love him and admire him so much.,Spurs,Yes,j7by8rp,t1_j7bwz4g
No.,Spurs,Yes,j7cfhoe,t1_j7c77dy
2-1 is a bit generous for City that kfc club eh? I reckon 4-0 for us with Porro bagging a hat trick is more realistic,Spurs,Yes,j7ao1up,t1_j7amhz2
Wonder why,Spurs,Yes,j7b1okh,t1_j7b0ubz
"Our biggest transfer expenditure ever was this year, after securing top 4",Spurs,Yes,j7b2yqj,t1_j7b0ubz
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,Spurs,Yes,j7b3ejr,t1_j7b0ubz
"Bro that is just sad and some p\*ssy shit. Winners focus on winning and losers focus on winners. Spurs need to get 4th. 

Ya fuck arsenal, but if they get first that should be a bigger motivation for us next season. We want CL and need 4th.",Spurs,Yes,j7bi8qd,t1_j7bgjsy
"We have one of the easiest calendars on the league for the rest of the season, wouldn‚Äôt mind City beating us today.",Spurs,Yes,j7bkvwy,t1_j7bgjsy
"I don't know if Kulusevski would be as creative there as he is in his current position. Maybe he would, I'd just be wary of thinking he would based on how he plays in a different position.",Spurs,Yes,j7b60uj,t1_j7afs40
"> if everyone would've seen the full match,

I did. Spence had a brilliant first half, then faded in the second. His defensive positioning needs work, but then he was playing RB - a position he won't have practiced at all this season. Mostly I think he wasn't match fit, which is hardly surprising. After he went off things got much worse defensively.",Spurs,Yes,j7anznw,t1_j7aigxr
"> People judge Spence by 2-3 cherry picked clips, if everyone would've seen the full match, there wouldn't be a lot of praise.

Tell that to Rennes fans who gave him a standing ovation when he came off. I've watched the entire match, he's had a ropey 10 minutes in the end, but other than that did fine defensively, and has shown attacking quality neither of our two other senior RWB had before we got Porro. I've seen every single player in our backline outside of maybe Davies do much worse than him defensively this season.",Spurs,Yes,j7aiwqr,t1_j7aigxr
Almost as if he needs more minutes and experience at this level,Spurs,Yes,j7ajw2x,t1_j7aigxr
"You can cherry pick his areas of improvements all you like but there is no way you can justify starting Emerson over him in any match, let alone half a season.",Spurs,Yes,j7akfhi,t1_j7aigxr
His main struggle from the highlights seems to be playing out from the back. If he can tighten up his possession game playing week in week out this loan might be hugely beneficial for him,Spurs,Yes,j7ajybv,t1_j7aigxr
Only 1 game,Spurs,Yes,j7c6yfa,t1_j7c5ybr
"Straight red - 3 games

Second yellow - 1 game",Spurs,Yes,j7c7m4l,t1_j7c5ybr
I think he wanted a starting spot. And he was never going to get that at Spurs,Spurs,Yes,j7b6b2s,t1_j7ab9b1
"1. It's unlikely we'll play Wrexham. They're reasonable underdogs for their replay
2. Not convinced the added audience is an opportunity to add significantly more fans to Spurs. Casual 'Welcome to Wrexham' fans are not looking for another team to follow. They're probably not football fans in the first place. If they are they'll already be very familiar with Spurs.

It's a nice story, I like the Wrexham tale but it's a bigger opportunity for them than us. We've been in a CL final in the past 5 years",Spurs,Yes,j7b4kf3,t1_j7b2z9m
Arsenal still have to play city twice and are obviously going to drop points outside of that. Why would any apparently ‚Äòreal‚Äô fans want us to lose a big game and damage our top 4 chances in the hope city catch up to them?,Spurs,Yes,j7an50p,t1_j7alapp
What a loser,Spurs,Yes,j7an2bk,t1_j7alapp
"I go to every game at home and a few away games a year. Who gives a shit about that shitty little club? You're just a banterless coward if it'll ""wreck your life"".

Up the Spurs! As controversial as that apparently is today.",Spurs,Yes,j7algmg,t1_j7alapp
"I've seen many horrible things but this is the most dog shit spineless take

Citeh needs 5 pts to take over and they can earn more than 50 pts if they go hard, we've won zero game against above us so far and some fan wishes us to lose just for a tiny minor inconvenience for them

You are just sitting on the other side but same kind of small club minded brainlets who shouts st totteringhams day regardless of winning fuck all, on top of casual discrimination",Spurs,Yes,j7aoogn,t1_j7alapp
"Hahaha.

"After our dominance over them in the league for a good few years, I just can‚Äôt deal with them winning the title the first year they‚Äôre good again ‚Ä¶ I just can‚Äôt",Spurs,Yes,j7ali17,t1_j7alapp
GTFO you plastic looser,Spurs,Yes,j7aw1yd,t1_j7alapp
Grow up,Spurs,Yes,j7b5qds,t1_j7alapp
I just wish people would chill re Spence. It's great he's looking to play week in week out and is looking good so far. But we have a world class RWB in Porro so we're fine,Spurs,Yes,j7b055a,t1_j7ax8i6
What are you on about?,Spurs,Yes,j7biep6,t1_j7bg8jw
"He did a much better job today then Porro would have. It wasn't at all Porros type of game. 

A good squad has different options, and he's a very solid defensive option.",Spurs,Yes,j7d41we,t1_j7d3tlb
"He had a very good performance against one of the best teams in Europe, on the back of having a couple of decent performances in last 2 games.

Yes, highly likely Porro will come in and do a great job as an attacking WB, does change his performance.

No need to shit on the guy, no need to caveat what was a candidate for MOTM performance.",Spurs,Yes,j7d8sh2,t1_j7d3tlb
"Think you‚Äôre going overboard on people having a bit of fun after he had a great game in a setup that suited what he‚Äôs always been pretty good at. That said, nothing like a top dollar signing at your position to light a fire.",Spurs,Yes,j7d65f8,t1_j7d3tlb
"Royal had a thundercunt cross that even Kane wasnt ready to hit properly, he's shaping up slowly i believe

That being said, can't wait to see PP steamrolling lowblocks with deki. Emerson showed today there's his place though",Spurs,Yes,j7d5fbl,t1_j7d3tlb
"The point is context. He‚Äôs been asked to do a job in a position he doesn‚Äôt play. No one is asking for him to be the nailed on starter, just asking for the guy to get a little respect for a great showing out of position. 

He doesn‚Äôt need people shitting in him and acting like he belongs in non-league football. Not everything is 0 or 100.",Spurs,Yes,j7dahr0,t1_j7d3tlb
I don't want to be hyperbolic but Royal is literally better than Messi and Ronaldo combined. We're living in Emerson's world.,Spurs,Yes,j7d7mat,t1_j7d3tlb
"Listen mate, I agree with half your opinions, but you have to learn that there is a huge space between top 5 in their position and League 2 level. A player with multiple seasons of experience in Serie A is pretty obviously not that bad.",Spurs,Yes,j7bmwk7,t1_j7bjd0j
"We haven't even seen this dude play in the premier league yet. 

Do you prefer Sessegnon over Udogie? 

What is this.",Spurs,Yes,j7bjmul,t1_j7bjd0j

I want THFC to win always,Spurs,Yes,j7aacfv,t1_j7a9ole
So what you‚Äôre saying is that you have more hate for Arsenal than support for Spurs?,Spurs,Yes,j7acjce,t1_j7a9ole
"No, they can still catch Arsenal regardless of today‚Äôs result. We need the points and the momentum it brings to our season",Spurs,Yes,j7abl1t,t1_j7a9ole
">We don't need to beat the league leaders to finish Top 4. Such games are a write off anyway.

what a shit take. if we had lost one of the matches to City last season we would have finished 5th.",Spurs,Yes,j7ac5up,t1_j7a9ole
 Man cares more about his rivals than his own team is what I‚Äôm getting from this. Fk the lot down the road. I‚Äôd rather us beat City. City have 6 points to take from the scum.,Spurs,Yes,j7al6gf,t1_j7a9ole
Eh fuck em. Do you see any of them now? They live for pessimism.,Spurs,Yes,j7coz8p,t1_j7cmguc

"It‚Äôs not just on twitter, it‚Äôs my real life. Can‚Äôt deal with those smug fuckers.",Spurs,Yes,j7b7vt8,t1_j7amql3
This just confirms what I've been thinking about people on here just being social media supporters rather than enjoying the games on TV/attending.,Spurs,Yes,j7b5njq,t1_j7amql3
I actually don't remember it at all. Probably repressed the memories of the Nuno era.,Spurs,Yes,j7cbqnz,t1_j7cb734
Form doesnt matter when its derby's west ham have been shit all season but they were good against us same with chelsea,Spurs,Yes,j7d4n0z,t1_j7cot18
"City and Arsenal both out of the way. 

Chelsea, United and Brighton fixtures are at Home.

It's not fluff, the fixtures were top loaded on the first half of season.",Spurs,Yes,j7cp8y6,t1_j7cc7n2
Plus Arsenal don‚Äôt need our help bottling the league. They can do that all on their own.,Spurs,Yes,j7a9m56,t1_j7a72kn

"Arsenal has one match in hand over City, and two over us, but they still have to play City twice so that‚Äôs a positive. If they drop points in the next few matches against Brentford, City, and Villa away there‚Äôs a good chance City can overtake them by the time those two play their second match together in April that will likely be the title decider.",Spurs,Yes,j7cgo4q,t1_j7c7iuu
This is Fantastic! Definitely sinking pints in the Bill Nick beforehand,Spurs,Yes,j7atpov,t1_j7atdf9
"Pundits are constantly yelling that Foden should be playing in midfield for England (he shouldn't), but Grealish might be the more worthwhile experiment.",Spurs,Yes,j7cfs48,t1_j7byhiz
Conte is always in charge.,Spurs,Yes,j7ahb8g,t1_j7a8xmh
Stellini is on the touchline. He's not making any pre-match decisions independently of Conte though,Spurs,Yes,j7b6e1j,t1_j7a8xmh

Basketball wise, this has been a horrible weekend, but I'm a bigger spurs fan than basketball fan.",Spurs,Yes,j7c75wv,t1_j7c6hs9
"Nah, you can't be doing that. I'd say suspend Casemiro for the rest of the season honestly.",Spurs,Yes,j7c9u1x,t1_j7c8z6e

"It‚Äôs in the post match. They go inside the dressing room where Kane‚Äôs talking to Conte who‚Äôs on the phone, he‚Äôs on speakers. Kane asks him ‚ÄòI see you Wednesday yeah?‚Äô And Dier comes screaming TWO DAYS OFF TWO DAYS OFF lmaoo

I‚Äôll try clipping it if possible but that‚Äôs what happened",Spurs,Yes,j7cbe6b,t1_j7cb1ny

"Feels good that there seem to be less and less alternative clubs for him to go to who are either big enough to match his ambition or wealthy enough to outspend us.

Like Sess has done any better at defending though. He was torn apart against Preston. Rather be on the front foot against a relatively fragile City and try to win the game personally.,Spurs,Yes,j7auk1j,t1_j7aufdr

"I used to work with a lad, 18. He was a gooner and he knew I was a Spurs supporter. One night we were out drinking, this was during the wenger days, he was wearing his arsenal shirt and getting drunk. Every so often he would grab the cannon and move it towards my face and say kiss the badge. On the third time I told him ""You do that one more time I'm going to rip that shirt from your back, drop it in the toilet and fucking shit on it. I fucking ment it. That little cunt made me so fucking angry that night. He didn't do it again. I get it.",Spurs,Yes,j7b2iwd,t1_j7aznee
Impossible,Spurs,Yes,j7b1r9f,t1_j7b1jjf
City winning today does not mean they will win the league. It just means Spurs are more likely not to finish top 4.,Spurs,Yes,j7bfx4m,t1_j7b1jjf
us taking the L today also increases the possibility of us finishing 5th and Arsenal finishing 1st. City winning does not guarantee them the league. I'm sorry.,Spurs,Yes,j7bfsvi,t1_j7bemou
"Id be up for it, if available, whenever we decide ro move on from son. Hopefully son picks up some better form and stays a while longer, but I wouldnt complain as much if we ended up with Kvararaskhelia after Son.

"I actually agree with you, but I'm saying look at that last post about spurs fans preferring to finish 17th over Arsenal winning the league. Even if we ""want that"" we NEED to win today.

"You may think you can justify it, but the reality is we‚Äôve seen 4 clips from one game and now you think he‚Äôs the new Messi. I‚Äôd back Conte‚Äôs decision over any fans.

"You literally can. Emerson for all his faults provides good defensive cover, especially when Romero pushes forward at times.

2. It is not a ""big game"" for us as winning it will not give us a trophy nor losing it will relegate us.      
3. Top 4 is not a trophy which we should be chasing.   

We may finish 3rd or 4th or 5th or 6th, it won't make any difference to us - we still have to invest the same but them winning the league is insufferable.",Spurs,Yes,j7anu8x,t1_j7an50p

"Kinda cliche but you should focus on things that are in your control. Had they converted the 2 big chances they would have been clear 2-1 or atleast be on level terms. PL refs have been shite all season, can't think of a single gameweek without a ref blunder.",Spurs,Yes,j7bab9q,t1_j7b8xh1
"lol, a point can make the difference between champions league and europa league.especially in a season where we have a worse GD than the teams above and below us on the table

">  He was torn apart against Preston.

????",Spurs,Yes,j7auubx,t1_j7auk1j

"Romero can't be himself and play CCB, would be a disaster",Spurs,Yes,j7c768f,t1_j7c5nou
"As I said, works both ways, but losing today increases the chance of City winning the league and that's the scenario I'd always take over us getting top 4 but scum ending 1st. I don't know if one can call himself a Spurs fan if he's fine with them winning PL, it means he doesn't understand this rivalry at all.

Don't take this personally btw., I saw your other comment. It's directed more at all the folk here who think them winning the league is not a big deal.",Spurs,Yes,j7bgtsy,t1_j7bfsvi
"Would you rather count Porro instead, considering we've actually signed him this season? The result is the same.",Spurs,Yes,j7b4b0q,t1_j7b38f5

">Some of you ‚ÄòConte‚Äôs and idiot‚Äô fans have somehow got this attitude that you know more than a man who is a serial winner. Know your ignorance

It's the other way around actually. Some of you seem to just worship him and think he can do no wrong even when he has regressed the squad vs last season even after getting 7 new signings. The delusion in you lot is astounding. Our results don't lie. Just open your fucking eyes.",Spurs,No,j7aneuk,t1_j7alt3f

"Oh yeah absolutely. Its horses for courses. But he is a useful option now I think. He's also just got unbelievable mentality as well. Man was booed off and on to the pitch in 2 different games, but his head didnt drop at all. It's actually pretty mad when you think how few players wouldnt be affected by that. 

He seems like a good bloke too and liked in the dressing room.",Spurs,Yes,j7d5nmk,t1_j7d4dhd

"Sess didn't have great games against Arsenal or Preston. He has pace but I can't see him being Tactically effective going forward against Man City. On the other hand Perisic has less pace and wasn't great at defending against Man City last time around. We kind of need someone with an extremely high work rate to constantly press, harass, and unsettle in that position. I don't know the answer.",Spurs,Yes,j7avp2d,t1_j7auqt5
Yeah and Saka took Sess for a joy ride just a few weeks ago. At least Perisic offers something going forward.,Spurs,Yes,j7avvxk,t1_j7av7b7

Can't say the same with Spurs.",Spurs,Yes,j7bn7tf,t1_j7bn0ry
"Please look at our team as a whole. We have more problems than Emerson Royal. We have issues with our fucking midfielders during transitional phases, our CBs outside of Romero are wank & one of our attackers literally cannot score to save his life while still playing near full 90s nearly twice a week.

But sure, all of our problems come from Emerson Royal & we replace him with a player who clearly hasn‚Äôt picked up the game at the level required for him to be a starter for us solves everything.",Spurs,Yes,j7aoxi3,t1_j7an40g
"> us having a shit season because of him.

Yeah it's definitely Emerson, who is playing exactly like he did last season, not Son and Lloris who forgot how to play football",Spurs,Yes,j7aq2qa,t1_j7an40g

"Plastic because I have a season ticket and want spurs to win their games..? Genuinely intrigued if you understand what the word plastic means? Because wanting your team to lose so that their rivals might have a slightly harder go of it half a season down the line is getting pretty fucking close to polymerisation.

If we‚Äôre a big club we should consider it. Son will be 31 next season and we need to get someone who can replace him in a few years.,Spurs,Yes,j77msug,t1_j77hk1a
He almost scored from that position in the first half.  Plus Rennes already had a player out wide.,Spurs,Yes,j78eqjn,t1_j78cd7t
That‚Äôs obviously a tactical instruction,Spurs,Yes,j78h7w0,t1_j78cd7t
"Too small sample but i felt that way too when he had 2 seconds game time, Conte must have felt some kind of tactical adjustment is needed from him

Problem is they use different system probably and it might not be a good idea to get used to it, though Conte might not be here when he comes back

I guess better question is, can Djed play rw? Is it crazy if i imagine bale on the other side..? Probably im crazy",Spurs,Yes,j78duzt,t1_j78cd7t
"Nah man. We gotta win, massive match for our club. Scum have 18 left to play, if they‚Äôre dropping points to Everton, they can obviously drop many more",Spurs,Yes,j76qjap,t1_j76pw8k
I honestly don‚Äôt get this mentality at all. We need every point to be top 4 and to be in the champions league again. People are really mixing up priorities - don‚Äôt let the rivalry blind you.,Spurs,Yes,j76qnd9,t1_j76pw8k
"dude if Arsenal want to bottle it, they will bottle it. If they want to win it, they will win it. Right now us playing against City is still an early outcome and plus we need top 4. We should hope Spurs win lol.",Spurs,Yes,j76rd6j,t1_j76pw8k
Give those oil cunts the points. This lot is not  getting top 4 and we all know it.,Spurs,Yes,j76rka6,t1_j76pw8k
If he does get sacked we should give him whatever he wants but I doubt he‚Äôd come tbh,Spurs,Yes,j77fyq1,t1_j77e0yc
"As much as I love Conte,

Klopp > Conte.

However, I do think Klopp will probably go to Germany so.....

but he does love Sonny. Come on Son, convince him to manage us lol.",Spurs,Yes,j77ffvt,t1_j77e0yc
This is the way,Spurs,Yes,j77eyoi,t1_j77e0yc
"Klopp falls in love. He will never manage another EPL team. If he is fired, he will go to a different league. But I think he's safe till the end of the season and he'll get given a chance to rebuild.",Spurs,Yes,j77pwmj,t1_j77e0yc
"He just switched off and nearly cost a goal. Ligue 1 Is also quite a step down from the prem, Spence should be looking good here or he doesn't have a hope. Royal and Doherty would also look very good and so would sess probably.  

I'm not saying he's not going to be good but this is all part of his development!",Spurs,Yes,j78fbps,t1_j78di35
Lmao. Imagine he starts Spence. Spence does alright shows promise and satisfies your weird obsession with him. Do we go in for Porro?,Spurs,Yes,j78hr9t,t1_j78di35
Defends very lazily,Spurs,Yes,j78fe8b,t1_j78ez7k

"No, it was shite.",Spurs,Yes,j782hh9,t1_j77z2qx
Which guy,Spurs,Yes,j78ftjw,t1_j78f8nu
Are you talking about Ten Hag?,Spurs,Yes,j78g7cg,t1_j78f8nu
Because Hitchen is a fraud. Simple.,Spurs,Yes,j78inei,t1_j78f8nu
iirc one of the reasons was that he wasn't planning on bringing any backroom staff with him.,Spurs,Yes,j78nis6,t1_j78f8nu
"starting to think he wanted more control in the transfer policy (look at United's now ) than what Levy/Fabio would have liked. Makes sense that bizarre reasons like his language , bringing in no backrooom staff were given because for a team in turmoil that season, a good manager who had his say in transfers would be fine,but he was always a manger for the top clubs so there was always this risk of backing him and then a City/United/Bayern swoop in for him and we would have been stranded.",Spurs,Yes,j79gqr7,t1_j78f8nu
No it was a loan so very much a club vibe,Spurs,Yes,j7600kv,t1_j75skff
"It's hard to call. The safe bet is that we'd stick with the usual team, but then I half feel like we might go all out and throw a surprise at home against City with the new signings. But then again, Conte is out, so would they really be changing things up without him making decisions at the training ground? Or maybe he is still quite involved without directly leading the training sessions?",Spurs,Yes,j76404h,t1_j763qzb
"But emerson was great in the city game, i say sub porro on at half time",Spurs,Yes,j764k5e,t1_j763qzb
Fuck off tbh Emerson has been fine the last few games. Conte not being present to access Porro at all before the game makes it more likely Emerson will start imo,Spurs,Yes,j763xty,t1_j763qzb
"Unrelated, but I've just realised your name is a Tame Impala reference, right on!",Spurs,Yes,j76a0uo,t1_j7682ia
"He wasn't horrible on defence, stop taking Kunt's opinion at face value. He was fine for 70 minutes, and below par for 10. They conceded 2 goals in the ten minutes after he was taken off, so the idea that he was somehow their defensive weak spot is ridiculous.",Spurs,Yes,j78jyp0,t1_j78j1sr
"Listen, we should root for the Spurs to win. What is this small club mentality lol. If they lose, fine we can be less pissed, but we should still want Spurs to win. Obviously City should be the favorites anyway, so there is no point in rooting for City to win tomorrow.",Spurs,Yes,j76v8xq,t1_j76trwz
"Plenty of times for Arsenal to drop another six points, we need to get every point we can. I won't be very upset if we lose however.",Spurs,Yes,j76uph1,t1_j76trwz
No,Spurs,Yes,j78p94s,t1_j78ndkm
"who cares, we might be able to finish 3rd. I'll take 3rd + a trophy any day of the week. Hell Arsenal could win the quadruple for all I care. I want a trophy and top 4, fuck arsenal and fuck Partey.",Spurs,Yes,j797exx,t1_j78ndkm
Yes,Spurs,Yes,j794jvt,t1_j78ndkm
Not happy with goals just to embarass us. Just lose the match gracefully 1-0.,Spurs,Yes,j79ge47,t1_j78ndkm

"Nobody, they won't sack him and rightly so, he's top 3 managers in the world, won the league and CL. Only until after he won all the biggest trophies have they since fallen into a multi-year injury crisis affecting their most important players, all whilst they haven't backed him at all. Needed a midfielder for three years and they buy 6 attackers. 

FSG clearly looking to sell, there's no one better available. It would be absolutely insane to sack him from every conceivable perspective. He's not going anywhere unless he quits.",Spurs,Yes,j79bkds,t1_j798mai
We should hire Klopp if we get the chance. He will absolutely cook with the midfielders we have.,Spurs,Yes,j79g78h,t1_j798mai

Funny how right after losing the first thing you do is check the Spurs subreddit. Live in your head much?,Spurs,Yes,j775hhs,t1_j77188g

Fuck off loser. Were still allowed to enjoy them looking like they'll bottle the league,Spurs,Yes,j76polv,t1_j76pjx8
They just lost to 19th Everton. How can you not laugh?,Spurs,Yes,j76qery,t1_j76pjx8

Oh wait, they both are hilarious lol.

"> the opposition have an easy day down his side

They definitely didn't, they had like one good attack from the left.

>Even though he‚Äôs good 1v1 unlike Romero, his off ball positioning + work rate is downright shite

He's been there for 4 days, playing in an unfamiliar formation as an RB instead of his natural RWB. People were saying Emerson was defensively shit after he was thrown against Zaha after being with us for like 4 days.",Spurs,Yes,j78ft3a,t1_j78fivt
"Even though he‚Äôs good 1v1 unlike Romero, 

i'm sorry what? You still on this? Romero is still a top 10 CB in the league even if he is off-form. Keep sucking off Hitchens. 

You can say Emerson is a shit signing, but Romero? What are talking about?",Spurs,Yes,j78ikh9,t1_j78fivt
I wouldn't go that far but I'd definitely agree Romero isn't a great defender in terms of leaving a ton of space behind him and losing his man. Genuinely elite ball player and he times his last ditch tackles well though.,Spurs,Yes,j78iz4w,t1_j78fivt
Norwich didn't have the legend that is Dyche.,Spurs,Yes,j75snvr,t1_j75mrdp
If there is one man who can get a relegation team to beat top of the table it‚Äôs Sean Dyche. In Dyche we trust.,Spurs,Yes,j75vj3z,t1_j75mrdp
why not,Spurs,Yes,j774v9p,t1_j77063z
That‚Äôs tough to say after today. Arsenal are young and have been very easily shaken by the occasion in years past,Spurs,Yes,j778ia8,t1_j770ufa
"He won‚Äôt get half a billion to rebuild the squad here. Every decent PL manager having so much to spend on rebuild would be near the top. Btw, he‚Äôs an ex gunner, why would we want him here",Spurs,Yes,j774kev,t1_j7747d8
"No way, I've said it forever, if they backed Emery the same way they backed Arteta they would have been in their current position just as quick if not sooner.

When you spend like they have, year after year, their current position should be the expectation, not a surprise.",Spurs,Yes,j774zmm,t1_j7747d8

"There have been plenty of good CBs going for reasonable fees as well, we just don't get them",Spurs,Yes,j76ckt5,t1_j75p29a
We're doing the Liverpool thing where we're waiting on a good player that we probably won't get Gvardiol/Bellingham only to miss out on good players that we could've gotten Badiashile/KMJ/Enzo just because we need a 100% success at that position so instead we go a whole season with a shit defense/Midfield,Spurs,Yes,j760qs4,t1_j75opia
"Yeah my question wasn‚Äôt great tbf, I‚Äôm Salernitana and the transfer window has just closed, I‚Äôm 5 games in to the season and haven‚Äôt scored a goal yet lmao but also the defence is very leaky (doesn‚Äôt help that my captain is Fazio). I think my midfield has been the issue with a lack of defensive cover because I‚Äôve been playing 433 which must be too expansive for the players I‚Äôve got. 

Would a 4222 with 2 dms be a solid base for me to build from?",Spurs,Yes,j76j2n5,t1_j76irxl
The haircut gives him a punchable face,Spurs,Yes,j75qx73,t1_j75p4r7
"I know utd fans were pissed, but grabbing someone's neck should be a serious penalty. I'd give him 5 games tbh",Spurs,Yes,j7785jw,t1_j777pz7
Agreed üòÜ,Spurs,Yes,j76qe98,t1_j76q88c
"Yet I do understand the merits of Emerson starting, and he has been good recently (even scored against City) but I can't wait to watch Porro play lol",Spurs,Yes,j777lzd,t1_j77580p
"Yeah but tbf its easy to sometimes criticize players for not making the correct decision from our view on tele, its a lot more difficult to spot and find the correct pass when you are on the pitch.

Agree about bentancur, Sess is another player who I think has great decision making but his execution has been very poor lately.",Spurs,Yes,j77t1d5,t1_j77ongg
"Sort of like Poch at PSG

think we need to rethink this idea that there are managers who are good in every situation. Pep Guardiola is an amazing manager but I‚Äôd like to see what he does with a relegation tier squad. Sean Dyche was class for Burnley but he likely wouldn‚Äôt really know what to do with a squad like City‚Äôs

Managing a top tier squad to win the league is very different to managing plucky underdogs to maybe get into European spots",Spurs,Yes,j76de0j,t1_j7686xu
Why feel bad for him? Supposedly he thought himself above Spurs when we were looking for a manager and ended up with Nuno.,Spurs,Yes,j760j1i,t1_j75yx4a

"Right. Makes sense with Son, Richi who can play there and the signing of Danjuma. Just can‚Äôt help but think how creative our attack would be at the wings with Kulu, Mitoma, Porro and Perisic/maybe Udogie.",Spurs,Yes,j77kqe8,t1_j77jcxu
"Agreed, but I doubt he‚Äôs going anywhere. Much of the new talent they‚Äôve brought in is with his system in mind.  He‚Äôll be given  at least most of next season to right the ship.",Spurs,Yes,j77j42p,t1_j77fyq1
Think he‚Äôd take a break or leave the prem and not come back. Doesn‚Äôt really have anything to prove here anymore and it‚Äôs clear hes not going to be backed until FSG sells,Spurs,Yes,j7827yk,t1_j77fyq1
"I rate Porro way higher than Spence. I definitely don‚Äôt have an obsession with him, don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre getting that from. I am just sick and tired of that donkey Emerson.

Yeah but a big chance Liverpool will sack or Klopp will want to get out. In that case..,Spurs,Yes,j79bx2m,t1_j79bkds
"Absolutely not me thinks. The league has been shifting in terms of managerial style since the COVID season. The end of high intensity , high pressing football **as a philosophy** is here. It is a cycle that needs to be reset every 4-5 seasons and a team need absolute precision in recruitment to navigate that. Plus the league has seen a lot of managers willing to adapt their systems to different style thrive in recent times like Tuchel,De Zerbi,Howe,Silva, Frank while not compromising their core view of footballing philosophy \[Poch is closest manager we have had who fits this description\]. We need a manager who plays attacking football,  but who isn't afraid to switch things up to win than an Anti-Conte who just plays attacking football but is adamant in implementing his style.",Spurs,Yes,j79iilp,t1_j79g78h
"Of course, also one player who absolutely will marvel in a Klopp system is Son.",Spurs,Yes,j79gfoz,t1_j79g78h

What has happened to this sub?",Spurs,Yes,j78jn3w,t1_j78iz4w

"I think a 4-2-2-2 can work but you leave yourself very light in midfield. A 4-4-2 would be better for a smaller team I think, it‚Äôs much more compact whereas a 4-2-4 is very expansive but it‚Äôs difficult to find traditional wingers in a top league. 

If you think you can score goals at the expense of defence I think it‚Äôs better to play a 4-2-4 like if you believe you can outscore the opponent but you haven‚Äôt scored a goal so it‚Äôs a holistic issue which in real football is solved by reverting to something simple and compact. 

Something else that can work is a 4-2-3-1 with a Shadow Striker or an AM and then an asymmetric midfield with a DM on one side and a CM on the other because the CM will naturally drop deep when you don‚Äôt have the ball especially if he‚Äôs a B2B. Sometimes I wish FM had a ‚Äúwith the ball‚Äù and a ‚Äúwithout the ball‚Äù tactic so you could set up different shapes because that‚Äôs how it works in real football.

But ultimately there‚Äôs no like one size fits all tactic, like some bits of this might work for you, others won‚Äôt and I think the best way to do it is to pick a tactic and then make small tweaks to it once your side is familiar with it and identify one problem at a time to fix and most importantly try not to panic about it and change things wholesale when your team has already become used to a tactic.

If all else fails download a tactic and say you made it lol",Spurs,Yes,j76klyv,t1_j76j2n5
Yankable hair surely,Spurs,Yes,j75tg0t,t1_j75qx73
I would give him 15 games tbh,Spurs,Yes,j77cj6c,t1_j7785jw
Yeah I was going to make that point. There are shades of grey here for sure. Sometimes certain things are not ‚Äúseen‚Äù on pitch as well. But it‚Äôs not necessarily about vision IQ. Decision making has as much to do with operating within a limited vision even. Interesting point about Sess. I‚Äôve never seen him as a ‚Äúhigh IQ‚Äù sort‚Ä¶.Any examples of that from earlier?,Spurs,Yes,j77wvcu,t1_j77t1d5
Just comes across like a nice man,Spurs,Yes,j7631bt,t1_j760j1i
So do you think if Spence came in and showed promise we‚Äôd get the higher rate win now player that Porro promised to be? Mate what I‚Äôm telling you is that Conte knows better than us what it takes for Levy to prioritize spending. Two quality wingbacks make us a menace next season,Spurs,Yes,j78ijxm,t1_j78i0ax

"No just that a defender can‚Äôt be called a good defender if he continuously makes mistakes especially the same mistakes

If the sub recognised Romero for who he is that is a shit defender but an elite ball player and won‚Äôt confuse themselves into thinking an elite ball player equals a good defender then I won‚Äôt speak of him ever again",Spurs,Yes,j78l1y1,t1_j78j5pu
"Yeah, I had the feeling you didn't watch the full match. That was the only good attack they had from his side. They managed to get one cross when he was marking a player in the box, and Andre Gomes's cross later. Outside of that, nothing.",Spurs,Yes,j78g89y,t1_j78fzyy
you probably think Sessegnon is a better defender than Romero.... I... CBA...,Spurs,Yes,j78lgmn,t1_j78kht5

why not the whole season lol.,Spurs,Yes,j77cv58,t1_j77cj6c
"Just in general whenever he plays he makes he good runs and finds himself in good goalscoring positions, very rarely offside, knows when to cut inside or go outside and put a cross in (even though his crossing has been very poor lately). He plays good one two and with other players and his defensive positioning is solid. I know right now all this might sound really weird given how he has performed this season but I still think his decision making is very good for his age.",Spurs,Yes,j7819g1,t1_j77wvcu
"That's fair... but I mean, it's not exactly like he's going to become destitute if he doesn't succeed with one of our main footballing rivals. After they throw like half a billion pounds at him to build a squad no less.",Spurs,Yes,j763oj5,t1_j7631bt
"You guys are coming up with so much bs it‚Äôs unreal. Every time Conte persists with his favourites even though they have no business being on the pitch, you lot act like it‚Äôs deliberate to send Levy a message.",Spurs,Yes,j78iu9w,t1_j78ijxm

"Would you replace him, or do you think he's valuable in a back 3 where his defensive weaknesses are less exposed? And how do you think he'll go in a back 4, asking as conte might be off soon.",Spurs,Yes,j78yk2q,t1_j78l1y1
"Yeah but something as basic as tracking your runner should happen 100/100 times. Switching off is a bad sign

Btw this might‚Äôve been the first time you saw him do it, wherever I watched him (incl Forest) he genuinely couldn‚Äôt care about runners in behind",Spurs,Yes,j78h1s2,t1_j78g89y
I mean that‚Äôs an assumption you created. You CBA about an assumption you create then that‚Äôs not my problem really,Spurs,Yes,j78ls9t,t1_j78lgmn
While we‚Äôre at it we might as well have scooped up Messi when he was 14 and chucked him in our academy,Spurs,Yes,j76ctaw,t1_j76cil0
"Yeah that can definitely work as a compact setup but a BWM can also act as a playmaker on support if you don‚Äôt have a playmaker in the setup but obviously won‚Äôt be as expansive as a DLP on support because they don‚Äôt have the ‚Äútake more risks‚Äù instruction on, but you can have them do that too. It‚Äôs about how compact and deep you want to be, you should be wary of playing TOO deep because FM doesn‚Äôt like that. It‚Äôs always better imo to play with at least a standard defensive line, rather than a lower line because FM always seems to favour less defensive tactics and to be frank the defending AI is wank this year, whereas the attacking AI is really good.",Spurs,Yes,j76mrgi,t1_j76l51u
"did Gold say that? Also if we turned Ten Hag down, it was Hitchens and Levy who mostly turned him down. not paratici.",Spurs,Yes,j78liky,t1_j78kekh

Ok boomer,Spurs,Yes,j79ohjg,t1_j79mw69
Of old or in their prime? Cuz two different players,Spurs,Yes,j78lel6,t1_j78l7yl
"IMO if Romero can reel in his aggression and only challenge for balls that are there to be won, and makes the right decision 90% of the time then he‚Äôd be invaluable for us

It can be trained because in Argentina‚Äôs back 4, he‚Äôs exactly like that. It‚Äôs controlled aggression not all out aggression like how he is for us. It‚Äôs so only because he knows he doesn‚Äôt have cover and can‚Äôt jeopardise the back line by going for a ball that‚Äôs not his and losing the duel. Watch him for Spurs and he does that regularly. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôd do well in a back 4 if continuously switched on and doesn‚Äôt forget the fact that he has no cover 

His ball playing is out of the world so replacing that would be insanely hard. Reel in his aggression and for once people might be right about having the potential to be a top defender",Spurs,Yes,j79gqu6,t1_j78yk2q
"That was never close to happening though, don't get why you're being a smarmy cunt.",Spurs,Yes,j77md9c,t1_j76ctaw

Lmfao and we were never close to signing Enzo either so whats the relevance? If we did sign him while he was young and at River Plate as opposed to signing an established player you‚Äôd be crying about a lack of ambition,Spurs,Yes,j77mydw,t1_j77md9c
"If you want more in depth stuff then check out Zealand‚Äôs videos, I‚Äôve played FM for over two decades now and I‚Äôve never learned more about the game than I did from his videos",Spurs,Yes,j76pu19,t1_j76pf0i
"His starting point is much much higher than Emerson so yes, I‚Äôve seen him hit okay crosses when he has time and space so he might not become Trips but with regular training he will become better than a Walker let‚Äôs say",Spurs,Yes,j79g79j,t1_j78xy5d
"Both were excellent in their strong areas. Bonnuci was a playmaker from deep but was a bull in the air and very rarely let his team down by making mistakes and Chiellini was a top notch defender who was the last and first man multiple times, would never get beat",Spurs,Yes,j78m0a9,t1_j78lg3u
"> If we did sign him while he was young and at River Plate as opposed to signing an established player you‚Äôd be crying about a lack of ambition

¬£30m on players that weren't used. ¬£42m for a player that was at the club before Conte. ¬£30m sales. Around ¬£110-120m net spend AKA ""over ¬£200m"".

""Oh, but the agent fees, wages, legal fees..."" I wonder what club would add those there as the ""transfer investment""... btw, has the ""committed spend of ¬£47m"" also added all of those numbers to it? Or is it because the committed ¬£47m will be on the next 'transfer budget'?!",Spurs,No,j71lzq1,t3_10scspa

"I don't understand why us fans have lapped up the agenda peddled by ENIC that Top 4 is very very important to us and as if it's some sort of achievement if we get it.      

Every year we fail to leverage that position to strengthen our squad and every year ENIC goes into money saving mode once CL football is secured.   

Poch was a victim of this mentality and even last summer we saw how it played out - no investment in defence because it was deemed ""good enough"". Running Lloris into the ground without a solid deputy. Cost cutting into RWB with Spence and so on.   

We have bought Porro again only because our Top 4 is threatened. I seriously doubt we will see any quality investment into CBs or GK this summer if we get Top 4.   

About time we just stop using the term altogether. All that matters is victory. You either compete for the PL or you don't. Cups are the same - a ""deep run"" in a cup is useless.",Spurs,No,j71tocg,t3_10scspa

Anyone know if tanguys deal with Napoli is an obligation to buy or an option. Read some reports that if Napoli qualify for champs league (which they will) it becomes an obligation. If so I guess 25m is a passable return on a disaster of a signing.,Spurs,No,j71hcpi,t3_10scspa

"Yep. It's also half way through the season. I would kind of get it if it was 3 games to go. They most likely won't win it anyway and we'll be sat here thinking ""God why were we hoping our team lost that time""",Spurs,Yes,j71j00z,t1_j71hr13

"I would love that honestly. I never had anything against Reggie, he just seemed to regress since the moment he stepped on the pitch until he became a total liability, but you could see a lot of it was injruies and mentals.

Really? The reddit experts told me there were no good CBs that we could've signed in the past year which is why we had to settle for Lenglet on loan.,Spurs,Yes,j73mdlc,t1_j73lmzh
Yeah agreed. Like obviously Dele has not maximized his potential as a player and that's a shame but it's really not anyone's else's problem but his own. Would wish people would just leave him alone tbh,Spurs,Yes,j728xwz,t1_j71wzfx
"Totally agreed. A big breakthrough for me to stop trying to analyze the situation was reading someone say *not everyone is career-focused, footballers included*. Everyone is entitled to take their job as seriously or not as they want, and that includes professional athletes.

Point being - everyone is trying to analyze Dele's career arc when he's just a human being like the rest of us. Whatever happened, we'll probably never know unless he talks about it.",Spurs,Yes,j729k75,t1_j71wzfx
"For about 3 years I was completely with you. But for it to happen repeatedly under different managers and then different clubs I had to give in. 

As for the cause, the first time I saw it was in Poch's book 

‚ÄúA year ago,‚Äù Pochettino writes in the book ‚Äì and this was back in 2016 ‚Äì  
 ‚Äúyou could yell at Dele during a session. But now you have to strike a   
different tone. You have to deal with them more sensitively, grant them   
the odd privilege that would have been impossible before. It is a very   
delicate balance.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe danger,‚Äù he writes in his book, ‚Äúremains that he‚Äôll forget what has  
 got him to this point. I‚Äôve had to repeat that to him this season. The   
other risk is whether those around him know how to treat a top-level   
professional. His WhatsApp photo of a cartoon of a boy surrounded by   
people who all want a piece of him suggests that he needs to be   
surrounded by the right people.‚Äù",Spurs,Yes,j72576t,t1_j71wzfx

Surely a Fulham win.,Spurs,Yes,j72w3z9,t1_j72vt1i
"What kind of fan wants us to lose any game? My brother go's for the Arse and i'll have to put up with more shit than most here, but he can say whatever he likes it's still no where near enough for my to want spurs to lose any game",Spurs,Yes,j72vgbv,t1_j72rym6

">Why is this the only place full of vitriol for THST? I'm not even staunch ENIC out, but the reaction to the board's statement here was veering into bootlicking

Edit: downvotes again proving my point.",Spurs,Yes,j73cf4f,t1_j73ajyx
"Reddit is quite a unique platform where most communities are very contrarian but portray themselves as the real-world popular opinion (lots of good write ups of this online mostly about the political subreddits). This place is no different and is the only Spurs community I can think of that doesn't reflect the everyday reality. 

Add to that most fans here are overseas and the trust mainly represent the local match-going fanbase then you get lots of people confused about who they are and what they do. 

ENIC good ""popular opinion"" + thing people don't know about saying bad things about ENIC = ""bad thing I must hate"".

"Next week maybe not, but we have a good run of fixtures soon and he seems like a massive bargain.

Collins, Kilman, Aguerd, De Vrij are very meh, wouldn't want any of them. Sutalo, Scalvini, Antonio Silva I'm not familiar with. Ndicka is okay but only because he will be on a free.",Spurs,Yes,j72kx7y,t1_j72bmua
"Give up on Gvardiol. He'll be going to one of the Spanish superclubs, City, Chelsea, Bayern and all the clubs that fit that mould. No way in hell we get him, even if we do cough up to Leipzig's asking price.",Spurs,Yes,j72gv5s,t1_j72bmua
Completely seperate matter of whether we actually want any though.,Spurs,Yes,j72c1ig,t1_j72bmua

"Hincapie and van de Ven

Edit: I also think Bastoni might actually be possible. Still haven't extended 1 year left in the summer Inter are in trouble and didn't manage to get paid for Skriniar who's leaving on a free.

"Every fan is entitled to be a fan however they wish. But I personally don't care enough about Arsenal to want us to lose any match, let alone to City at home. Any dropped points makes it that much harder for us to get top 4, which needs to be our goal for the league this season.

Also, worth remembering that City have 2 matches still against Arsenal. If City don't win the league, it'll be because they didn't take advantage of those matches.",Spurs,Yes,j72nfmp,t1_j72lftg

"I 1000% agree with you about ""the next best alternative"" approach we should have, and that's where I think our scouting needs to be exponentially better. Paratici has hired some new scouting talent, so hopefully that leads to improvement in finding those players that flop less often.

I think that's a bit of a harsh assessment of our midfield, but not overly harsh.

* I think PEH would be a fantastic squad player, but I generally agree that we should look to upgrade on his technical ability if we can. Squad players are an important part of a ""title-winning core in midfield"".
* At worst, jury is still out on Bissouma. He deserves at least until some part through next season to prove himself. Different players take different amounts of time to bed into a new environment, new team & teammates, new manager, new systems of play, etc.
* If you think Sarr has the potential, then I think Skipp does as well and he's demonstrated it during Conte's early days. I know that's a matter of personal opinion, 

Of all the general positions to improve on, I don't think midfield is the one to focus in on as opposed to centerbacks.",Spurs,Yes,j72cebw,t1_j7291j5

"A bit of a non-answer from me, but I'd be okay with either. Emerson has had a run of a few good games and his defensive skillset makes sense to start against City. Sub him off for Porro if we are chasing a goal later in the match.

If Porro did start, that means he has Conte's full faith that he's ready, and that's such an exciting prospect in and of itself.",Spurs,Yes,j72g4tf,t1_j72fa67

We spent loads of money last summer? It probably wouldn't have been as much had we not got champions league?,Spurs,Yes,j71zyxq,t1_j71tocg
"This is all factually incorrect, do you really believe any of this deep down?",Spurs,Yes,j72ie2h,t1_j71tocg
"Perhaps because we are realistic and not fantasists.  I have been watching Spurs for coming up 35 years and ENIC have delivered the best teams of that period barring the very start of it.  We were left a long, long way behind the curve due to being absolute rubbish and insolvent when the Premier League kicked off.  We also got the hammer for financial irregularities and were nearly relegated as penalty.

Poch was a victim of his own success, and failure.  Half the amazing team he had was there when he took over and his choices in the transfer market  - ie don't sign anybody at all and do sign GLC, Ndombele etc - have ruined us for years.  It is completely false to suggest this is all down to ENIC wanting to turn a profit.

We didn't cost-cut at RWB for Spence, we invested in a young player who may well end up making us a profit or being a first team player.  We couldn't get Porro in the summer despite trying as Paratici himself said.

We are competing in the PL and we are improving the squad, we're just not the best team and don't have the deepest pockets.  What you seem to aspire to is being the next Chelsea or Man City which almost nobody really wants deep down.  It will be the end of the club in spirit.  

It would do fans, especially new fans, to get real about what kind of club we are and what is possible.  We can be better, but the only way we spend big is to earn big.  That has been the focus for the last several years.  We are in a position to continuously invest in the squad but we are never going to financially dope the team.  

In 2017 our revenue was 180m behind Chelsea, 200m behind Arsenal 250m behind City and >400m behind United.   Why ever didn't we outspend them while building a stadium?  The answers are bloody obvious.

The only path to success is to incrementally build the team (and be good at recruiting instead of very poor) or to sell out the club to a gulf state and financially the dope the team.  Bahrain FC.

"There was a report today that they're not going to pay 25m for him, but are considering buying him at a discount, so I guess that clause wasn't put in place. Still, getting rid of him at any price would be a good thing at this point.",Spurs,Yes,j71htv5,t1_j71hcpi
"I hope so, he came from playing a similar system and the wingback role is pretty well defined. You see teams like Chelsea chucking Enzo straight into the starting 11, we should be confident to do the same. Porro is class and can handle it.",Spurs,Yes,j73689o,t1_j7317yy

This line is so critical to me.   

Seasons after seasons of Top 4 have given us nothing.   

What was the reward for finishing Top 4 last season? A Clement Lenglet on loan and our defence being even worse than last season with Dier and Lloris declining.   

Top 4 should just not be counted as an achievement. It's only an agenda by ENIC since it helps them with more revenue. It gives us nothing as fans.",Spurs,Yes,j71s5jf,t1_j71j3vi

Mmm Perisic was a winger and he went to Bayern and came back to be more defensive to adapt to the wing back role. Reguilon is a defender and he sure ain‚Äôt going to get more attacking skills at athletico,Spurs,Yes,j72qbtq,t1_j72luyo

"Look you and I are saying the same thing. The 35 year journey that you talked about and building the team incrementally is what I agree with and it is what we've done till now. Where you're wrong is the piece below:

Yes we're not the best team but we could've been. And it doesn't need oil money or 100m signings - KMJ was right there which we slipped on. Similarly, the haggling that we do and miss out on Bruno, Skriniar, Grealish, Porro (almost) has to stop and get the right talent over a second choice in GLC, Rodon, Spence. We waste more money turning over the squad than what we would've spent getting them first time right.    

And I'm not aspiring to be the next Chelsea/Man City. All I'm aspiring for is to win the PL which we should all aspire for.

"I see it as an investment. One loss can be massively useful if it prevents Arsenal from winning the league - every point matters.

He's a club captain of 8 years. If anyone deserves to play himself out of the side it's Lloris. We'll get a keeper in the summer,Spurs,Yes,j727ut4,t1_j721ak9

That's exactly what I'm saying. We do try for this but club's ""Top 4 is good enough"" mentality is what stop it from going further. If we aimed higher, we would have leveraged on the Top 4 and not just hired Conte but also upgraded his defence to make us competitive for the title.

"Because has stated a fact....they spent x amount. You're picking it apart saying it doesn't count becuasr Udogies not here or Spence hasn't got gametime. It doesn't suddenly mean the money becomes unspent. They have still spent the money. 

This whole idea that we haven't spent money is mad. We have. We've spent a lot, we just haven't spent particularly well at time and the club even acknowledged that themselves.",Spurs,Yes,j72bc2i,t1_j729anb
"Lloris and Dier both had very good seasons last year that is undeniable. Yeah they‚Äôve both been shit this season and I agree a top class CB and starting keeper should have been our transfer priorities, not spunking most of the budget on getting a backup striker, but that is down to poor strategy not a lack of trying to improve the squad and aim higher",Spurs,Yes,j722gwj,t1_j72161h

"You have me completely wrong. I never said Emerson should break somebody's ankle nor did I say we should fuck off to EL. IMO We should try to finish as high as possible. My take was only with regard to this specific match.

I never cry about spending enough because we do. I just want our scouting to be better and us to haggle less. We missed out on Bruno and Skriniar and Grealish and almost Porro due to haggling and let talented bargains like KMJ and Khvicha go which we needed desperately because our scouting was poor.",Spurs,Yes,j71uj5j,t1_j71smqw
"It's a happiness equation for me as a Fan. Spurs getting top 4 gives me 40 Happiness points. Arsenal getting Top 4 means I lose 20 points. Both values multiply by 3 if anyone wins the league. The table is as follows:

">Sorry about that but if what you‚Äôre telling us is true I have a feeling you‚Äôre going to be miserable at the end of the season. 

If Scum keep winning and we help them by taking points off city, I'm afraid this is going to be true.

But Top 4 is just an imaginary podium that fans have started to be happy with because ENIC keeps using it as their definition of success.

I mean what difference  did it make other than lining their pockets with more revenue?,Spurs,Yes,j71u0rn,t1_j71tg3e
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs imaginary when it qualifies you for the top European competition; a competition we should definitely be competing for every season.

"Biggest shake up to football ownership in years leaked - what it means for your club

- Dodgy owners will be blocked from getting hold of our footie teams under a huge clean-up.

- It would mean the likes of sanctioned Russian Roman Abramovich would be kept out of the Premier League.

- Fans will get a say in running clubs and stop bosses radically changing logos and kits.

- Clubs will fund a regulator which will have powers to ban them from breakaway leagues.

The major shake-up will also:

- Ban greedy clubs from joining a breakaway competition like the European Super League ‚Äî which triggered huge protests by fans in 2021.

- Tax teams an annual fee to fund the regulator and expose them to breach sanctions.

- Let the regulator raid money from the Premier League to help prop up lower leagues.

- The charter plans to tackle murky moneymen and stop them from getting their hands on our clubs ‚Äî to defend teams against financial and cultural ruin.

- A new regulator will enforce four tough terms clubs must meet to gain a legal licence.

- Teams must only take part in tournaments that have been approved by the regulator ‚Äî meaning a ban on ‚Äúbreakaway‚Äù competitions such as the proposed European Super League.

- Wannabe proprietors will face robust checks on their ‚Äúsource of wealth‚Äù. It means multi-millionaires who cannot prove they amassed their fortune legitimately will not be allowed to complete takeovers.

- This seemingly rules out oligarchs eyeing Premier League sides and grifters who have previously put smaller teams at risk. 

- Culture Secretary Michelle Donelan wants the regulator in place for the 2024/5 season and will formally unveil legislation imminently.
Under the proposals ‚Äî expected to be signed off by Cabinet shortly ‚Äî all clubs in the top five flights of English football would need to gain a fresh licence to play from the regulator.

- They would be charged a yearly levy ‚Äî with richer clubs paying more and small sides less.

- But getting the permit depends on meeting tough criteria, including a rigorous vetting of prospective owners and directors. The regulator would carry out due diligence checks so undesirable investors are prevented from staging a takeover.

- More than 60 sides have gone bust since the Premier League was founded in 1992. 

- The reforms could set ministers on a collision course with clubs resistant to more regulation. 

- The regulator would require clubs to have deep enough pockets to stop themselves going bust ‚Äî and establish a new code of conduct ensuring financial stability.",Spurs,No,j6wc9h3,t3_10rigkm

"Scalvini would be great. Only 19 and already a starter for Atalanta and his stats are looking really great - especially for his age. He‚Äôs versatile, can play everywhere in a back 3 and even played as a DM here and there. 
But he‚Äôs Italian and highly rated. It will be difficult and pricy to get. But not impossible. And if we can spend ~¬£60m on Richarlison as a backup, Scalvini should be doable.",Spurs,Yes,j6w8prr,t1_j6w4wrj

"I hope he does and I think he will, barring the bottom falling out over the rest of the season. I believe him when he's said repeatedly that he believes in the project --- he's a lot of things but hasn't ever struck me as a bullshit artist, whatever job he's been in. I also think he would still \*love\* to be the guy to take the club that everyone thinks isn't supposed to be able do it to the top.

Also, while things can change, not sure there's another obvious place to go as another better option right now? He's already done the sabbatical thing and it didn't seem to suit him. Italian NT? Been there, done that and Mancini's still there anyway. Maybe Juve before this mess, but hard to see it now. Can't think of another obvious high profile PL vacancy on the horizon and I think so long as he wants to be managing he wants to be at the center of the European league universe.",Spurs,Yes,j6yfm9e,t1_j6y1x2d

"I hope he starts using better and more entertaining tactics, so that he deserves to stay.

As things currently stand, I don't think he will stay. Too much distancing himself from the club, no new contract, family still elsewhere. And unless the performances improve, I believe the club will think it may just as well look for a new manager.",Spurs,Yes,j6y9199,t1_j6y1x2d

"It's been a long time since we've had a top quality #6 or #8.

"I'd say it's 50/50 at best. Big fixture that he'll have a lot of defensive duties. Lack of system familiarity might be a reason to make his debut start next week, perhaps off the bench this week",Spurs,Yes,j6x95zb,t1_j6wwdkc
Would be really harsh on Emerson who's been good lately. Letting him settle properly until leicester is fine imo,Spurs,Yes,j6wzpmq,t1_j6wwdkc
"I rate Emerson (yes, he doesn't hit a good cross), but I think Porro does go straight in to the starting lineup Sunday. He is match fit. Need to take a risk or two to get back into the top 4. And the supporters will love it.",Spurs,Yes,j6xt7sg,t1_j6wwdkc
You're comparing 2 clubs with completely different financial setups tbf. Comparing us to lpool is a much better comparison. And the difference between us and them sadly is they didn't have ndombele flops.....they got all their bug transfers right for a period and we got all ours wrong.,Spurs,Yes,j6ylajh,t1_j6yhxmj
"Sorry but this is missing the mark.

We can't financially cope with our biggest signings being shit, and you need at least a 50/50 success rate on signings, ours has been far worse until Paratici.  

The Loan/obligation does nothing except keep us good with accounting periods and spread costs between years.  It doesn't give us an out if they are obligations.  

The goal of the board is to grow the club into a commercial beast so that it self-funds top-level investment in the team.  They refuse to bank-roll player investment as if it is their plaything and I am ok with that.  For me the investment level is completely fine and plenty of clubs do far better with less money.  What we really need is to have a proper recruitment strategy and bring some youngsters through.  That's exactly what they said they are focused on.",Spurs,Yes,j6z8ppd,t1_j6yhxmj
Young winger at Sevilla called Gil may be a good shout,Spurs,Yes,j6wacy9,t1_j6w3vb6
"It's a real tricky one. Not Kane replacement tricky, but not far from it imo.

 Kulu is basically a nailed on starter for years to come if he keeps doing what he's doing, and we are not a team constantly directly involved in the title race.

So we can't act like a Man City and bring in Mahrez and Grealish who are happy to play second fiddle to Foden and Sterling for quite a while, because they realize they're winning leagues/strongly challenging for the UCL.

So in my opinion, that takes guys like the above-mentioned Raphinha off the table.

It would have to be a younger player with something to prove, or a veteran looking for one last big gig, but I prefer the first one.

Kudus, Zaniolo after this whole Roma mess (if Conte stays), and Olise being my top 3.",Spurs,Yes,j6w5h0a,t1_j6w3vb6
"It's helpful to have backups with a slightly different style, which gives options from the bench.  Given that Kulu is creative/intelligent/inverted, would be good to have a right footed speed merchant as his backup.",Spurs,Yes,j6w475y,t1_j6w3vb6
Kudus would be good. Suprosed noone went for him in Jan,Spurs,Yes,j6w49tc,t1_j6w3vb6

"I‚Äôve seen so many weird takes from the EnicOuters, but the last week has been the weirdest:

Signing one starting rwb (a key position) and an attacking backup, made this ‚Äúby far the worst window ever‚Äù according to a number of tweeters. 
Also, Conte hasn‚Äôt gotten a single player under Enic, is ‚Äúhung out too dry‚Äù, and I‚Äôve now seen three claim that Enic/Levy is what caused Conte‚Äôs gallbladder problems. 

I think Levy and Enic have made a number of mistakes. But the current ‚Äúlet‚Äôs turn any issue at all into a Levy proble‚Äô‚Äù, has the opposite effect on me, makes me want to distance myself from any EnicOut posts.",Spurs,Yes,j6xk97s,t1_j6wmg64
What an absolute clown,Spurs,Yes,j6wo7et,t1_j6wmg64
"I think this is exactly the divide -- most people who want ENIC out have only known ENIC, when things were relatively good.

"I really like both of them and really like the pod. I do feel at times though they have slight blindspots. 

Like they were both saying the treatment of Gil was mad in that he'd finally broken into the team and was loaned out.

"Sad more about Doherty the person and less about the player. Yes he wasn‚Äôt fantastic but he was very well liked in the locker room, had a level head on his shoulders, and worked hard. Doherty the player definitely wasn‚Äôt good enough to be a starting Conte wingback, but Doherty the person deserved a better exit.",Spurs,Yes,j6vybb4,t1_j6vxwl2
"Yeah I respect him and his attitude but these are the kinds of players that need to go, he just isn't at the level required.

Spurs supporters are loyal to a fault, we need to get a bit more ruthless with refreshing the squad",Spurs,Yes,j6vyb2t,t1_j6vxwl2
"I mean yeah outside of that February-April run last year his spurs career has been underwhelming but that during that run he did look great and was a reason we finished top 4. Regardless reasons why spurs fans are upset. 

1. He is friends with Harry. Outside of Eric, Doherty was Harry‚Äôs second closest personal friend on the team and losing a player who Harry is close with probably makes our Kane retention chances go down ever more slightly (I know this is stupid, Harry Kane isn‚Äôt staying at spurs because he likes a player but I guarantee you this is going through at least a few peoples head)

2. He‚Äôs not Emerson 

3. Why do you terminate a player and not sell him it just looked like the club completely mismanaged the situation into terminating a player who wasn‚Äôt causing an issue like how many clubs fucking terminate players that are well liked? 

4. The only opportunity he got a consistent run of minutes in his preferred position he looked good. He hasn‚Äôt seen consistent minutes this season. 

5. He‚Äôs an attacking RWB so looks better emerson

6. He‚Äôs not Emerson 

7. Didn‚Äôt get a dime for him in the transfer market. 

8. Spurs fans thought we were going to exchange Porro for Emerson and have Porro and Doherty which they were content with, but now we have Porro and Emerson 

9. He‚Äôs versatile and looked competent at LWB virtually covering two positions in one player 

10. Spurs fans really fucking hate Emerson",Spurs,Yes,j6vyn38,t1_j6vxwl2
"Not 100% but I'm pretty sure we're all aware of how unspectacular he had been. Just the abrupt nature of his termination caught us off guard. At the end of the day, he hadn't caused any problems off the pitch, had been diligent on the training ground, and always put in a shift while on the pitch. Despite his subpar to below par performances, I think he rightfully deserves to have some fans miss him for these things.",Spurs,Yes,j6vyiji,t1_j6vxwl2
"This feels like trying to find the negatives tbh. Doherty leaving over Emerson- dohertys been terrible this season sk really who cares. To say it out weighs the positives of getting one of the most exciting rwbs in Europe is a stretch. 

Gil leaving instead of moura, neither are particularly great and are most likely stop gaps anyway. Gil didn't want to be here and do cameos off the bench whereas moura loves the club and is happy too. 

Max kilman we were never seriously linked with other than some random ITK on twitter. I wouldn't really be too disappointed with that as its probably not true. Is kilman even really thay good? Certainly not the steps uo that badtoni or Gvardiol or the other ones we were linked too are!",Spurs,Yes,j6w1vxf,t1_j6vuatr
"I do think it was a positive window. Transfers in will have more of an impact than what was lost. We‚Äôre not an oil club or owned by some war criminal, think we‚Äôve spent well and looking good for the summer (provided Kane and conte stay)",Spurs,Yes,j6vuq7r,t1_j6vuatr
"I think Lucas being back in training makes the decision easier, he was playing as a wing back in preseason and could play there if needed.",Spurs,Yes,j6w7qgs,t1_j6w6j7y
Think it was because we had too many players out in international loans,Spurs,Yes,j6w9wmq,t1_j6w6j7y
Perisic and Sessegnon have both played on the right this year. Then you've got Lucas and Kulu as emergency options.,Spurs,Yes,j6wbqm3,t1_j6w6j7y

"Yes, seemingly that's it, similar to Joey Barton's domestic abuse trial.

As for United hopefully they just pay off his contract.",Spurs,Yes,j6x20zn,t1_j6x1kbh
Probably far closer to what happened with the Joey Barton trial where the victim does a 180 and then the CPS can't do a thing.,Spurs,Yes,j6x1g14,t1_j6x0r33

">Have you watched Deluefou for Udinese

Yes, mainly because of Udogie. And yes I have to admit he looks fantastic for them, but I just don't think his game would translate well into how we play this season.

Everything they do is quick, fast movements, counters, and he's the main man that everything goes through. In our system, where he wouldn't be able to hold on to the ball as much, and not have that time and space to create, because Conte wants manny passes around the box, without anyone having the ball at their feet for too long, I think his creativity would lack. Also, even though he's already had stints at Watford and Everton, I don't think he would have a fun time with his size and build.

Also, Danjuma is 2 years younger.",Spurs,Yes,j6wg3ub,t1_j6wfcjl
[deleted],Spurs,Yes,j6wh8s4,t1_j6wfcjl
Does he play much on the right? Transfermrkt says he does but I can only remner him playing left wing for Watford and everton,Spurs,Yes,j6wfr5g,t1_j6wfcjl

"He said Romero and Udogie are shit, and that we desperately needed Traore and/or Gordon.

He also thinks Doherty is the second coming of Cafu.

His takes, in fact, are not actually pretty spot on",Spurs,Yes,j6wwgi5,t1_j6wlcbv
I disagree with you.  He sounds like a child.,Spurs,Yes,j6wn4zz,t1_j6wlcbv
"He‚Äôs got very good knowledge of lesser known players/players from other leagues. But he‚Äôs not a prophet, the guy thinks Gordon would be a top level wingback, nearly as bad as the McNeil fanboys.",Spurs,Yes,j6xakgx,t1_j6wlcbv
"Spot on or extreme, pick one",Spurs,Yes,j6wst35,t1_j6wlcbv
Think scalvini would be a good buy tbh,Spurs,Yes,j6w9zze,t1_j6w8prr
"Someone like him or Antonio Silva would be fantastic in the Dier role, spraying passes from the back.",Spurs,Yes,j6wbtux,t1_j6w8prr
"Scalvini is a great shout. His stats are crazy, passes the eye test and has immense WC potential. My only concern is if we'll pay the huge money it'll cost to get him. (No chance)  
And if Conte will start a 19 year old. (Again no chance)",Spurs,Yes,j6wcqk9,t1_j6w8prr
"If Sess stays we‚Äôll have 4 LBs. I‚Äôm guessing Reguilon will be sold this summer. Unless Conte gives Udogie the Spence treatment, I expect Sess to be 3rd option in which I can see him being loaned out",Spurs,Yes,j6w2lzq,t1_j6w244x

"Since the WC he‚Äôs been unhappy with the lack off game time, one report was he threatened to leave, and became a dressing room disruptive, then when he found out he wasn‚Äôt starting vs Arsenal in the FA Cup he had a training ground bust up with Pep, thus City gave him the green light to move.",Spurs,Yes,j6x3je1,t1_j6x2sst
"Our friend below did a good job of answering, all I‚Äôd add is he basically expected to be starting every game, felt entitled to it, and constantly was fighting with Foden who plays on the same flank. 

Basically thought he was bigger than the team and Pep said ‚Äúokay, you‚Äôre out‚Äù. It‚Äôs the type of move that requires a lot of balls and that brings the team together. It will also usher Foden back into form as the other LBs don‚Äôt cut inside as much which allows them to play balls down the line rather than in through the middle where it gets crowded out.

Just really feels like one of those massive decisions s where you flog off one of the biggest players in the team for the benefit of the whole",Spurs,Yes,j6x4lh1,t1_j6x2sst
his wages are also going to be taxed at a much lower rate i believe. wouldn't surprise me if he took a reduction in pay and still made the same,Spurs,Yes,j6xjylf,t1_j6x8exj

"Spot on there I think. We‚Äôve done pretty well bringing in versatile players for the front line, I think a good final piece would be a right winger he could double up as a CAM so we can switch formations. Kudus would be insane for this I think.",Spurs,Yes,j6w5qa7,t1_j6w5h0a

"I guess what i see is a lot of people who think we are vastly underperforming, but I don't quite understand where they think we should be? Not sure it's totally realistic to think we can be top2 every season when the Manchester clubs have vastly higher rev and Chelsea spend like drunker sailors.

Of course Enic/football department have made mistakes and every decision that hasn't worked out can easily be picked apart in hindsight, but they have also made a lot of good decisions and it seems we are about where we should be in terms of a club, but I really wanted to open this to a discussion as maybe my view is totally warped by what happened before Enic and maybe revenue is not the biggest determining factor of success?",Spurs,Yes,j6y5u9h,t1_j6y4q7i

Do you know when they changed the match day?,Spurs,Yes,j6zp9se,t1_j6zkd4u
"Oh man, he really does, but I also think people need to appreciate how hard it is for a player to break into the first team. You have to be good enough to get noticed, both technically and physically, but thats not enough because we already have pretty much 2 internationals in every position so you need some luck to even get a run out in the first team, and you need a manager who both suits your strengths, but also has faith in you and will understand mistakes are part of the learning curve and not just bin you for not tracking a man that leads to a goal. But yeah, so many players look good at youth levels but just don‚Äôt have what it takes and end up in the lower leagues. But to be honest, a career in league football has to be considered a success, only the 0.01% of people that start make it to the top level.",Spurs,Yes,j6yngxf,t1_j6xxwlv
"and the fact that the only reason Gil played at all is Deki, Richy, Sonny and Lucas were all injured.

I 90% agree with your points but don't tell me you still hope we would sign anyone like Bastoni or Gvardiol. Let's accept the reality. Kilman is best of the rest which we should've signed and could've signed had we not left the negotiation till the last day.,Spurs,Yes,j6w2b2g,t1_j6w1vxf
"That's true but there's going to need to be some explanation as to why the budget was so low (reported to be ¬£30M at the start of the window, we end up going for 2 loans, one that'll end up around ¬£40M and the other that probably won't be bought out, after having a full season of games and events at the stadium and with leftover money from the summer injection (not 100% confirmed where that money went, maybe they'll come out and say this isn't the case). 

Obviously we don't need to spend money just to spend money, especially if none of our top targets are available, but we didn't get a Kulusevski backup nor a CB and got Danjuma because he was cheap. Extremely concerning if our last summer was just an anomaly and instead this approach continues into future windows",Spurs,Yes,j6vwqch,t1_j6vuq7r

He‚Äôs also very evasive and uses his size to his advantage",Spurs,Yes,j6wggq0,t1_j6wg3ub
"A decent bit. I know Deulefwou cuz I watch Udinese for Udogie

No I do not but I know Doekhi. Spurs played his former team Vitesse in the UECL and he got sent off in Conte‚Äôs first ever match for us which happened to be a wild ride cuz Romero also got sent off from our side",Spurs,Yes,j6wi6d1,t1_j6wh8s4

I could be wrong but even Conte hasn‚Äôt clearly favored one over the other this season.

"actually considering they are better at selling (See Ndombele flop) they have not spent much more than us over the past decade in net spend, that is skewed a little bit due to them being able to cash in on the Neymar transfer when they sold Coutinho for 150m to barca

Chelsea fans: ""Jesus, our club is run by amateurs. Just look at this transfer window. Throwing money around to make us an easily ridiculed by everyone, and topping it by selling our starting DM/playmaker to league rivals.""  
ManU fans: ""Jesus, our club is run by amateurs. Our stadium is falling apart, they're stealing hundreds of millions from the club chest directly into their own bank accounts.""

At a guess it will be 

In

HG Gk in (raya/pickford/hendo)

LCB- Bastoni/Kilman/hincapie

CCB (also covers rcb) - no idea on this one tbh.

Another attacker if Danjuma doesn't stay.

"Prem league wages. Why would a player like Ndombele accept a lower wage to play in Italy when he can just be loaned out to play in Italy and still get Kane wages. 

They have all the leverage because the club is desperate to get rid of them. So even a loan/termination works. The player still gets his contract money and gets to play football. Its a win win for them to refuse any transfers and force a loan/termination",Spurs,Yes,j6s0cv1,t1_j6qwgij
"Normally we put a ridiculous fee on their head that European clubs can't afford. We turned down permanent sales for Ndombele and Lo Celso in the summer.

"At least Eriksen won't be playing in the final, that would hurt even more. Fuck Newcastle though.",Spurs,Yes,j6umf1j,t1_j6u5svq
Newcastle haven‚Äôt even spent anything outrageous though. They‚Äôve been smart the last few transfer windows and trusted Howe who‚Äôs proving to be a really good manager.,Spurs,Yes,j6uw3a7,t1_j6u5svq
"I don't think people are actually upset about the money that we missed out on. I think it's about letting him go like that all of a sudden on deadline day because of a technicality. 

And he was of course very likeable, plus add to the fact that we all wanted him to play instead of Emerson, and even though he has a bigger audience for future sales due to his age, everyone wanted to see Emerson's back, not Doherty's.

Plus add to the fact that he was best mates with Harry and Dier.

And then, there is of course the post-match interview  he did last year after one of our wins where the journalist asked him something along the lines of do you see yourself leaving any time soon, to which he replied: ""Why would I want to be anywhere besides Tottenham?""

I think people on the sub are frustrated by the combination of the above named circumstances, not the potential money we could've gotten for him.",Spurs,Yes,j6r5w50,t1_j6r4tin
"I liked him very much, seems to be a really nice bloke. His actual spell at RWB was very good, shame it lasted so short. Is it best for both parties?

Yes, yes I am",Spurs,Yes,j6rc1i1,t1_j6r4tin

"I mean he's only just 31, we might as well be accurate.

I don't think we know about the situation yet to respond either way, but terminating contracts is pretty unusual (I can only recall doing this with Aurier in recent years) and suggests a lack of proper planning or joined up thinking. It's not so much about Doherty as an individual - we'd need to shift him sooner or later - it's just indicative of usual activity, which could be fine, but without knowing the circumstances that brought it about (and I doubt we ever will) I think it's pretty normal for fans to raise an eyebrow.",Spurs,Yes,j6r7809,t1_j6r4tin
"How can anyone not moan about selling the 2nd best WB at the club after Perisic (before Porro) and keeping an actual amateur who offers nothing offensively as backup to our extremely attack minded RWB?

"We improved our first eleven by a lot, how often do people think that happens in January?",Spurs,Yes,j6sgmmt,t1_j6sg9m9
Still think that not addressing CB was a mistake. I‚Äôd say around a 5 or 6 out of 10. Could always end up being better if Porro completely changes how the squad plays,Spurs,Yes,j6skp95,t1_j6sg9m9
In a way. We have so much deadwood (like the Doherty debacle proved) that getting the unquestionable correct players in is better than going for gambles. Like #1 RWB target is much better than settling for whatever cb we could get a deal for,Spurs,Yes,j6sgvwg,t1_j6sg9m9
"For now, yeah. Time will tell if not getting a CB is going to cost us or not.",Spurs,Yes,j6sloju,t1_j6sg9m9
Porro is huge but getting rid of his first choice back up and not signing a Kulu backup are horrible decisions,Spurs,Yes,j6sj5fv,t1_j6sg9m9

More like they didn't plan to be over the limit because Spence demanded playing time at Rennes?

If you want to reflexively call everything they do stupid, I get it, but in this case I don't really see the issue. Doherty is probably worth less than his wages if we're stuck with him and isn't a long-term keeper.

Having said all of that, I still can't believe we left so much business for the end and only brought in 2. Should've just paid the release clause for Porro. All of this about their league cup game, I don't believe it. No one cares about that trophy. It doesn't qualify you for Europe or anything.",Spurs,Yes,j6t8e08,t1_j6soijl

Like, if someone got banned for dodgy dealings in any sector or industry, would you want to enter into dealings with them? I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with it.

Not for me it wasn't. I didn't think either Doherty or Emerson were complete liabilities. Sure, they should be upgraded, but that was never our main problem.

We may have some problems in an attacking sense from the RWBs, but they weren't singlehandedly costing us games.

Again, we have problems going forward, but we still have great attacking numbers and options.

Now, look at teams like Man Utd and Newcastle. They aren't prolific goalscoring teams, but have a great defensive structure with their new signings and their results are better for it.

UCL we were the better team, if anything kane helped derail us by forcing through he jad to start when clearly he wasn't fit. 

Euros, again yeah he was OK but ad captain an a world class striker could maybe have stepped uo more rather than the average performance he put in. 

And recent world cup quarter he missed a pen.

I love kane and he's the best spurs player ever for me. But it's not like he's been with Southampton or something his whole career and never made it to any finals. We've been in positions to win things, as have his country, and he is part of the reason why we then didn't win them.",Spurs,Yes,j6rqsim,t1_j6rq6r0

The problem this season is that we are trying to press high. Last season we kept compact in a mid/lower block and had some incredible counters, but struggled to create against low-blocks, but that was a lot better than this season.

The pressing this season is highlighting our lack of individual quality at the back. And it's not only the CBs who panic when isolated. Sess and Perisic aren't able to deal with 1v1s.
