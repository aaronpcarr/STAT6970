I don't think we we're winning the league this season. Arsenal are catchable but we're not good enough to do that this season. Honestly I'm fine with that. We can't win it every year. We'll have to do some good business in the summer window.,Manchester City,No,j7c4yng,t3_10u9zmi

"Are you guys really surprised? Lol. This team is not winning anything this season if this type of performance continue and its not 6th or 7th time i said that and seems like its continuing. Leipzig and Arsenal will just torn us into shreads with this kind of performance. Not a single game i really enjoyed or tell that i really liked the performance after wc. I don't know wtf is happening behind the scenes but something ain't right, its atrocious performance after atrocious performance cant believe it really.

"Seems people are mixed on this, but playing Grealish and Mahrez together is just so bland. Amazing players on their own, but having them both on as wingers is why our attack is so toothless. 

Grealish tends to slow our attack down and if Mahrez isn’t on form, he creates a huge hole of nothing on the right and is a possession recycling machine.",Manchester City,No,j7ch4tu,t3_10u9zmi

"I am tired of the officiating in this league. Just in our game today, Romero had four bookable offenses, and doesn’t get sent off until the 84th minute. Hjoberg fakes a head injury and stops our attack only to immediately sprint back onto the pitch with zero repercussions.  

How many games this season have we had “player x deserved to be sent off but wasn’t” and the press and club do absolutely nothing about it. And this isn’t new, as I’m well aware. I remember KBD almost having his leg broken against Palace during our centurion season and it was barely a foul. Rudiger breaks KDBs orbital bone and dodges a booking because he pretends to be injured too.   

Rashford is offside, everyone knows it, the crowd, the pundits, the players, but it’s still given and changes the game. Follow that up with “oh yeah, next time (and every time before) that’ll get blown back for offside. Whoopsie!” bullshit that we continue to get.  

I just want games called fairly, and if an official misses something than it is dealt with properly after the fact with massive fines and suspensions if necessary. At this point I’d love it if there was a conspiracy against us, because then it would provide a reason as to why the officiating has been so shit, but at this point it’s just tough to watch.

Man all i'm trying to say is I want to see the City of the past four or five years and how we played then instead of whatever the fuck this is. The playstyle is unrecognizable to anything we've done under Pep before.,Manchester City,Yes,j7cc9j7,t1_j7cbuj0
"Yeah I think he's trying to plaster over the *teams* weaknesses, but by doing so he's sacrificing our ability to play to our players individual strengths. 

Grealish being a prime example. If you gave him support we saw at Villa what he can do if you keep leaving him in 1-on-1s but Pep is not willing to use an overlapping LB or have the 8 overlap him instead and he's just always double or tripled up on. All he can do is pass it back inside because we don't want to lose the ball above generating threat. 

Similar with Haaland. He makes so many off the ball runs but most of our team deem almost any pass too risky in the moment and prefer to keep hold of it and wait for other players to form up. 

The real shame is the players that could begin to solve these kinds of issues are the ones really out of form, injured or not currently trusted. If we could get Laporte, KDB and Foden back into the team and purring I feel like we'd be miles better. Really crap about Stones getting injured again too, and the fact Bernardo's heart just isn't in it anymore it seems.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cgco0,t1_j7cbuj0

"yeah this system potentially could work with some tweaks. A pacy, creative winger who could stretch things out and make it less narrow might elevate the system. A better back 3 who can actually do something going forward might add another dimension. (honestly this system with Laporte and Stones in there could have potential, but Stones can't stay fit and Laporte has been sent to the shadowland for some unexplained reason) that 3 ATB today was inexcusable. no wonder we didn't create shit. that line up should only play if everyone else is injured.

No it doesn't. But its worth a try. If we don't change anything we are not going win the league forget the champions league. Gomez is technically a good player. Defensively he's bad but that's what we have. Bernardo is class when he's next to Rodri with traditional fullbacks. He doesn't have the final delivery to play in his current role. What's the point in playing Haaland if youre not going to find him.,Manchester City,Yes,j7celnp,t1_j7cdxta

Tbf we won’t know what Pep has in mind until we actually see the squad play,Manchester City,Yes,j7bh1a7,t1_j7bgvvp
"In possession it makes sense to play both on the right? unless you're throwing someone else forward to contend with a back 5. 

The issue is out of possession, if Lewis is a RB that puts Walker at CB in our block, which in theory isn't a problem but it is a different role. More space to track, you can't use the sideline, something I think Walker relies upon a lot. 

And Pep mentioned Lewis at LB not long ago so it could legit just be LB Lewis. I hope it goes well for him if it is though.",Manchester City,Yes,j7bin55,t1_j7bhot6
"For a second I thought you meant to all be sold I was like WHAT

But yeah, I mean. If it's really really needed we could do that, double pivot of Gundo and Bernardo for a game or two to give Rodders a rest. 

Perrone was on the bench which is a good sign. Hopefully he is to our level already.

We've chopped and changed the back line way too much also this season. Really shit that Stones is injured again, I feel like he's the only other player, bar Walker that Pep plays in the RCB position. 

I can understand Ake is playing well enough to keep Laporte out of the team atm, and Pep doesn't seem to want him in the middle, it's LCB or nothing (For Laporte).   
But Dias should've probably been in there instead of Akanji, not that he was particularly woeful tbf. 

But it feels like the RB situation has really fucked stuff around. Walker has had an off (mainly through injury) season, Lewis has been great but is so young Pep doesn't want him playing every game. But Pep can't play both of them on the right so things were changed again to get Lewis in at LB which changes things for Ake etc etc

Feels like we need stability. I think he should probably, at this point say ok. Lewis is our starter. Ake-Dias-Akanji-Lewis will be our back 4 for the next X amount of games and let it meld for a while. 

Laporte can come in for Ake just fine. If Stones is fit I'd prefer him over Akanji. But the fact Walker can only really be this static RB is a pain, he can't invert and he struggles with being a full CB. The only other way I can see him playing is you let him off the leash as a flying attacker, but you have to have Bernardo in midfield to drop next to Rodri if you do that. You need to get Mahrez the ball, have him stand up his man and let Walker overlap constantly.

Which is what Grealish has never had btw. He's constantly on his own and more than anything, I feel like getting in a LB might unlock Jack even more than just solidifying our defence.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cezc8,t1_j7ccgnu
"Lol I listen to all kinds of music when I'm happy, sad, angry, etc. It definitely helps me get through the hard times for sure though. Maybe we all need to listen to some music for the rest of our games.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cauf1,t1_j7ca9y4
That's the thing though. Peps not going to give up all the control just for Grealish to be running at players with Ake overlapping.,Manchester City,Yes,j7cbahw,t1_j7canmy
"The 3-2-5, 3-2-1-4 shape is fine. Just don't have the perfect personnel for it.

Like, that back 3 needs Laporte. Build up is awful without him.

Using Bernardo as a 10 kinda ruins it because he doesn't compliment Haaland too.

We didn't use the half spaces too well.

Squad balance right now is bad and that's on the club and him too. Cancelo's departure could be explained tactically but doing it now with 0 replacement is baffling. 

And I like Palmer but replacing Sterling with someone like him is simply surprising. And don't say Sterling's final action is bad, Palmer's is worse, his profile was valuable and wasn't replaced.",Manchester City,Yes,j7ccv6q,t1_j7cc9j7
">the fact Bernardo's heart just isn't in it anymore it seems.

Can't say it's reflected in his performances, today's at least. As a 10, he's simply lost the ability to penetrate with passes. 

Anyway, do agree. There are players who can solve some of our issues but aren't favoured or injured. 

1) City's build-up without Laporte is inferior. Use him, and City can construct attacks better.

2) Foden's verticality is what City need, play him in advanced positions near Haaland.

3) Gundogan too. As an advanced 8 he offers verticality and movement. 

Other issues but the summer can only solve them.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cgu7n,t1_j7cgco0

"I think our defense is fine tbh, we aren’t really leaking too many goals. Its not perfect but not a crisis. I would say all the goals against Spurs were due to stupid mistakes and completely avoidable. However, unlike the game at the Etihad we didn’t score goals. Haaland and Alvarez were just completely frustrated by Spurs’ defense, who are a bunch of cunts tbf. Our greatest strength has been creating chances but we’ve just been missing that for some reason and until we bring that back we won’t get the job done in the future.

Might be wrong, but I think it’s down to KDB. He finds form, starts unlocking opponents, and we will win games. I don’t know what’s up with him, maybe the WC really fucked with his head, but I hope he starts doing his thing again. Even though he wasn’t at 100% we looked like we could score once he came on. Having Foden back would be helpful too.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cgrhm,t1_j7cezc8

"The thing is, this squad balance is on Pep too. Why don't we have a left back, why are all four of our wingers the exact same profile, why are we so short on midfielders, that's all decisions Pep made as well. All i'm saying is he shouldn't be getting off completely free of criticism since he has a part to play in all this too.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cbtxk,t1_j7cbahw
I pretty much agree with what you said. Hopefully we fully fix all these squad building mistakes in the summer. And I pray to god Pep sorts out these tactics. I've pretty much given up on the prem but we need to do something in the CL at least.,Manchester City,Yes,j7cdkt5,t1_j7ccv6q
"He still runs, puts the effort in but he's just not happy. I don't know I feel like I can see it, he's not passionate, doesn't have that fire about him like he used to. It's a small thing but I feel like it is a factor. 

What do you feel Laporte does specifically that Ake doesn't? because it feels at the moment like Ake is playing really well and is keeping Laporte out the team. Pep seems to trust him a lot and really rate him highly at the moment and when I watch him play his passing is really great and I think he is better defensively than Laporte. But I also feel like Laporte just has something Ake doesn't but I'm not sure what it is specifically. 

Off the top of my head I feel like he sits wider when he passes down the line to the winger, and has more of a threat to find the 8 as well than Ake does. And perhaps picks 'safer' passes, meaning to players that aren't as pressured. But I'd like your insight. 

I agree on Gundogan and Foden. It's just a shame Gundo is probably tired and Foden is so out of form at the moment.",Manchester City,Yes,j7ciy6q,t1_j7cgu7n

"Rico? If you're not going to play inverted fullbacks he would be just as bad but right footed. He's a few years away from being a starter. Reason for playing Gomez is that he's a good crosser, technically decent and most importantly left footed.",Manchester City,Yes,j7ci4lk,t1_j7ch87u

I'm suggesting this lineup (dropping Haaland, playing bernardo deeper and switching to traditional fullbacks) so we can move the ball quicker and have some fluidity. The reason those players have been so bad is that we are static.",Manchester City,Yes,j7civy8,t1_j7cgcqi
Gomez being a failed winger was the reason he was converted into a LB,Manchester City,Yes,j7cgelv,t1_j7cf041

"Yea, totally. We were probably not ready for Haaland. All of our team was geared towards a false nine system. Maybe Alvarez is a better fit for us. I'm not so sure.

Maybe we could play Gomez and Foden on the left and Alvarez through the middle as he's more comfortable on the ball. If we move the ball quicker and switch play more often most of our problems could be solved.",Manchester City,Yes,j7ccgf2,t1_j7cbtxk
"Judging by the way we're playing, and the way that Leipzig are playing atm in terms of their style and personnel, I wouldn't be surprised if we lose by a 2 goal deficit in the first leg.

As it is, we have to go to Arsenal before that, so good luck to them on that, I guess...",Manchester City,Yes,j7cyhlr,t1_j7cdkt5
"You are right, Ake's a phenomenal pure defender, which is why I love him, but the biggest difference between him and    Laporte is the ability on the ball. Switches of play to wingers, clipped passes to runners to progress play, tidy progressive passes from first to second play. 

Remember Ake's back pass to Ederson v Spurs a few weeks back, where Ederson makes a terrible blunder. But put Laporte in that situation, and City might not have conceded that. No Ake hate though, crazy defender. 

>I agree on Gundogan and Foden. It's just a shame Gundo is probably tired and Foden is so out of form at the moment.

Yes.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cjfzn,t1_j7ciy6q

Pep seems to trust him a lot and really rate him highly at the moment and when I watch him play his passing is really great and I think he is better defensively than Laporte. But I also feel like Laporte just has something Ake doesn't but I'm not sure what it is specifically.

It's pretty obvious tbh. The weightage, choices, and directions of pass are varied and most of the time correct, and he isn't all that fearful of playing a driven ball to break the lines.  Watching Ake's passing most of the time is futile as he's always playing the same safe options, which while in theory should have us keep the ball better against teams that aren't interested in engaging with our backline, doesn't help in games like this against quality opposition. It's not obvious since alot of our CBs will have many sideways passes as a result of our system, but you can see when he plays as to his capability of playing a line breaker, or even pass in a way where the midfielders play forward without needing to do much to clean up the initial pass received. If you notice, he gestures quite a bit during the build up to help the team progress or retain the ball at the back successfully, especially when it comes to encouraging our players to use Ederson more.

Tbh, I also have the same criticism of Stones at times, but unlike Ake, he does have the ability to be more incisive on the ball.

I actually thought we found a great role for Ake in this flexi LCB/LB shutdown wide defender role where all of the burdens in possession aren't on him, but it seems like we essentially reverted to the United gameplan in the back, albeit with Lewis inverting, instead of Joao out wide, which meant alot of the burden fell on Ake to break the lines.

For a coach who rates passing ability so highly to a fault, it is surprising that Pep's actively played our worst ball players in the back in so many big games this season, let alone, in many of the other games.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cwjak,t1_j7ciy6q
"Absolutely, too afraid to spend. Who cares what's people are going to say they are going to say anyway so just spend.",Manchester City,Yes,j7ceyih,t1_j7ccmq7
"Nah. If they spent 100m on Jack because Pep was getting turned on by his ball-retention and foul baiting, then I don't think you can blame the spending. 

If anything, what's clear is Pep's made a choice by going for this style of play, and the club serve him on that in terms of the recruitment. I wouldn't be surprised if he genuinely comes out and believes that this personnel is fine in playing in this way.",Manchester City,Yes,j7cz1h3,t1_j7ccmq7

We've been alright without him in the last 2 seasons. I don't blame him but we don't have the player profiles to make it work at the moment and pep won't give up the control to get the best out of Haaland in transitions.

I don't deny that he has improved somewhat in that aspect, but we'll agree to disagree on his capability of doing it, since it's very clear against the bigger teams that it does hinder us on the ball.",Manchester City,Yes,j7d1k0l,t1_j7d1bel

"From what I've seen, his shortcomings aren't exposed against crappier teams or teams that play more fearfully against us teams due to obvious talent gaps. So he's able to look better.

Not saying I'm especially convinced by our play at the back - it does feel like we're hanging on by a thread at times - but the numbers aren't as terrible as the reactions make it seem,Manchester City,No,j76sxd4,t3_10tesy4
I know it’s hard but surely we can do it alot has changed now we got haaland alvarez now we have to score at tottenham let’s break all those fucking curses this season and bring it all home,Manchester City,No,j76t693,t3_10tesy4
Looking like a great day already! Loserpool concede in 5th minute 😜. Keep it up,Manchester City,No,j76ucdd,t3_10tesy4
This is what NO ONE apart from us was taking into account. There comes a time where it’s the mid to late game of the season and your fairytale first half doesn’t mean shit if you don’t have experienced players who can hunker down and grind out the wins. Arsenal are in totally foreign territory,Manchester City,No,j76qk3a,t3_10tesy4
"I hope Everton win this game but I also want them to get relegated. 
Arsenal dropping points to a relegation zone team is a great way to potentially drop morale and obviously dropping points will be great for us, but also I love a FM save with historical clubs who have fallen on hard times and Everton in the championship with money problems sounds fun.",Manchester City,No,j76eg56,t3_10tesy4

"Yeah they truly ran their squad into the ground. It’s a cautionary tale for top teams. Pep has his issues, but he won’t keep playing someone who isn’t showing anything. Klopp seems too loyal.",Manchester City,Yes,j76z2sm,t1_j76ysdz
"Yup haha, Ferna's Dark Arts were clearly more powerful",Manchester City,Yes,j77c7h2,t1_j7791n9

good option but you know brighton will want fuck you money,Manchester City,Yes,j77effo,t1_j77dc0l
"Depends on price and expectation. Who else we go after etc. 

I'd probably still prefer Leao or Kvaratskhelia over him but he'd be a fantastic depth option. 

If we could get him for like...£40m at **most** then it could be a great move. But I think Brighton will ask for like...£60m minimum? after losing Trossard.",Manchester City,Yes,j77drt2,t1_j77dc0l
Fat Frank ftw,Manchester City,Yes,j76h4z9,t1_j76gvt2

Honestly? Officials are scared to call the games properly at Anfield. Just look at Liverpool fans calling in death threats against teenage officials that lead to youth games being called off a few months back. We’ll batter them when they visit us.,Manchester City,Yes,j7783bk,t1_j776pt7

"The new manager bounce can definitely happen. It's not a given every time but sometimes a team can respond strongly to the right coach.

Honestly thought they had signed the perfect manager when I heard about allardyche. They need someone to steady the ship after the revolving door of managers they’ve had since moyes left.

"His YouTube masterclass was one of the more eloquent ones there. Very clear and unapologetic.

Bernardo I can understand. But why do they want Laporte? They already have decent CBs,Manchester City,Yes,j7ao26t,t1_j7al3rw
"Wouldn't be surprised at this tbh. 










Barca have been flirting with Bernardo for like at least two seasons now, and it's well known he wants to move closer to home. The interesting thing, is I'm not at all surprised if the Laporte thing has some truth behind it, I think he would fit their style of play perfectly and he's been unhappy whenever he hasn't been starting every game. 








I think this would indicate we're going for another CB (hopefully Gvardiol?) since Stones/Dias/Aké/Akanji would not be enough depth given Dias and/or Stones are usually out for periods of the season and Aké is seeing more and more minutes at LB. 












Youth leaving is never nice to see, but I'm not surprised either. Imagine being a young academy player trying to break into our first team with the quality of players we have. I'd imagine it'll be similar to Lavia + Bazanu where we sell them but have a reasonable buy-back clause. 












Can imagine we're gonna be spending big in summer if we move on Cancelo, Laporte, Bernardo + youth players.",Manchester City,Yes,j7av3te,t1_j7al3rw

Yeah cancelo to Madrid makes sense to me also (would then have a good shot at winning all 5 top leagues). They're definitely in need of a younger RB or a less injury prone lb. A nice buy one get one 10m off deal for real would be good for the 2 Portuguesers.,Manchester City,Yes,j77fe14,t1_j77earg

"Yeah I reckon gundo/Bernardo leave and we go for Bellingham, leao and mitoma and shift grealish into the gundo role. (probably kvara would be a better choice if we were getting mitoma for variety). Tbh even if gundo stayed I'd probably suggest getting some new legs there as he can't play every game and likely would be gone a year or so later so would be good progress planning. jack can still cover the Wings to allow gundo game time with Phil getting in on the right with mahrez. I'm in Dreamland I'm well aware.",Manchester City,Yes,j77h73f,t1_j77gnd3

Yeah if we could get...£100m our of Madrid for Cancelo and Bernardo? it's a bit of a discount for Madrid for two players of that quality but we'd also get these players who don't want to be here off the books and that would almost pay for Bellingham itself. Then we can spend big dealing with LB and winger.,Manchester City,Yes,j77gw9v,t1_j77fe14

"I'm feeling confident Gundo will stay for a bit longer recently. But I agree we should try and get cover there anyway. A lot depends on what level Perrone is to be honest, he's the one factor I can't really equate with anything. 

But right now it feels like the dream window would be selling Bernardo and Cancelo. And bringing in Bellingham, Kvara, Davies then bring in Tielemans and Guerreiro on frees for added depth. 

You can add Laporte leaving for Gvardiol and even Phillips for Lavia too. But that's the kind of window I think would really transform the team and shore up our weaknesses.",Manchester City,Yes,j77i2sv,t1_j77h73f

"Mitoma and Kvara are impossible in the summer, both clubs have pricks to deal with, they're going to demand 120m+ and if they're generaous. Grealish and Foden are not wingers at all and they're one dimensional. We need a direct pacey winger this summer. The attack is too stable. And yes Leao is not a pep player but he is pretty young and can develop more under pep. On paper Haaland is also not a pep type no 9 but under pep he will develop more and more. Diaby is a good shout too , can play both wings , direct and have great pace.",Manchester City,Yes,j7ag2r6,t1_j7adytb

"I get what you're saying but if Foden was in form and banging in goals like he was not too long ago, rn we wouldn't be having this conversation. I don't think he's going to be out of form forever and even Grealish has improved now. Personally I would rather wait for the right player. Midfield and Left back are more of a priority. And if we have the funds we should also replace Laporte with Gvardiol.",Manchester City,Yes,j7ajy3f,t1_j7ag2r6

"Guardiola was speaking about Cancelo’s exit, “In this situation he didn’t play the last two, three games. We cannot say he didn’t play much because in the last few years, he was one of the players who play more minutes, by far.”

"Sssshhhh, that's slanderous towards all the ""Jude is the messiah"" truthers on this sub that only watch one collective half of City playing football a week.

Having said that, if it was true that we didn't go for him in the summer because we wanted to placate a guy that has been twerking towards Barcelona for 3 seasons straight (not forgetting how brilliant or committed  he's been for us, of course), then it seems like a massive fuck up on our end.",Manchester City,Yes,j7488mf,t1_j73niws

"He has the highest xa in the top 5 European leagues, i can see why you think hes like Silva, he is quite good at ball progression too but still kinda raw.

"They're comparing the fact that he's played more in Europe, which is true.

Although, it does come with the caveat that he's played in some Dortmund teams that he's not particularly lifted in the way you'd expect brilliant players to do. 

He scores goals and is extremely dynamic. But I've not seen him be a reference in a way people talk about him as. Also, as we saw in the WC, he and Rice were incapable for showing and progressing play from the midfield against any half decent setups to the extent that they were actively hiding from the ball.",Manchester City,Yes,j749cir,t1_j748j4u

"No worries at all! I’m American as well but I’ll do my best to describe it

I shredded some carrots and chopped an onion and seasoned those and cooked all the moisture out in a pan. Once that was looking dry I added a few pounds of ground beef and seasoned that as well. Once the beef was browned I added a little tomato paste and cooked that off for a minute. Then I added a half cup of flour. The flour helps the meat base stay thick for the remainder of the process. Once the flour was cooked off after a minute or two I added a large amount of beef stock, some Worcestershire sauce, some garlic powder and a squeeze of some stone ground mustard. I let that simmer for a while and added a full bag of frozen peas to lower the temperature of the beef and get the base set. Once the peas were mixed in the base was looking thick, it was done.

In a separate pot, I had peeled and been boiling 4 large potatoes in some salty water. Once the potatoes started to fall apart (just past fork tender) I drained all the water and added the potatoes back to the same pot. I added a a stick of butter, a splash of milk, 2 egg yolks and a full block of aged white cheddar to the potatoes and started mashing. I got a micro plane for Christmas and also mixed in a clove of garlic to the mash with some rosemary. 

Once the potatoes were mashed and the texture was smooth, I spread the potatoes over the top of the meat base in an oven friendly dish. I used cast iron. You want to try and get the potatoes as even as possible and spread from edge to edge in the pan. Once it looks relatively even, I started on the outside edge with a normal fork and worked a spiral going inwards. The more cracks and crevices in the potato top means more crispy brown bits in the final product. I baked it for about 30 minutes til the I could see the base was bubbly around the edges and the potato top looked puffy. Last thing I did was put it under the broiler/grille for about 90 seconds and it was done!

It tasted like a slightly looser meatloaf topped in super cheesy and a bit crispy mashed potatoes. For a first try at it I was insanely satisfied with how good it turned out but I think I might use less tomorrow paste next time to go for more of a “beefy” flavor. Absolutely recommend it.

Had I used lamb in this process instead of ground beef, I think this would have been considered a shepherds pie.",Manchester City,Yes,j749e9c,t1_j746s8r
Just a joke about how Kun speaks. 🙃,Manchester City,Yes,j74pa1g,t1_j74p1ei
I see a lot of david silva's qualities in wirtz though which neither phil or bernardo really turned out to have. We're on the brink of a generational shift either way so there's no guarantee that our system is going to stay the same in a season or two.,Manchester City,Yes,j72nfhw,t1_j72jtz5
"Yeah I saw that too. Looked up his stats after seeing it haha. Normally with players like KDB or Odegaard their passing numbers, in terms of completion and pure numbers, are actually kinda low but their key passes, through passes xA and all that are like elite of the elite. 

It's players like Gundo and Silva and Bernardo who have that full green passing stats, just good at it all, involved a lot, and that's what Dominik has. 

David Silva even comes up as a match on FBREF but that's obviously current Silva not at hie height our Silva (although he's still doing very well for Soceiadad) 

Seems great at set pieces, and for a midfielder, although he doesn't seem very successful at tackling people he tries to quite a bit. As long as the work rate is there I think we can be somewhat happy as we press in numbers. 

Doesn't seem great at dribbling but doesn't get dispossessed a lot which is great.

So yeah. Looks very promising, looking forward to watching him. Just hope all that xA doesn't fall to Nkunku's feet tbh. It's going to be a super tough tie, Leipzig are flying atm.",Manchester City,Yes,j74efhb,t1_j747erb

"True the system will change when Pep leaves. I disagree about Wirtz personally, he might have some qualities of a Silva but I think he's a very creative risk-taker like KDB, loses the ball too much to be a Silva or Gundogan in our team.

He is super young though so he could definitely be trained up, the talent is there. But if that's how you see him fair enough. Would be fun to get someone like that for sure, I'm just not sure this summer is the time if we're going after one or two LBs, a winger, and potentially fighting for Bellingham.",Manchester City,Yes,j72p4bp,t1_j72nfhw
"Yeah that's maybe the issue. Since he's already been out on loan it might be difficult to convince him to be third string. I think we keep both Ederson and Ortega obviously. 

I'm not sure about the Bazunu buy-back honestly. Maybe we just sling it with two keepers?",Manchester City,Yes,j73meaf,t1_j73hjqh

I feel like we need Ake at LB for the remainder of the season. I would love to see Ake-Laporte-Dias-Walker though.,Manchester City,Yes,j70m2hb,t1_j70corg

"To be fair mate, just went and had a *fly on the wall* glance at their thread and they’re all fairly together on him being a scumbag and they want him gone.

"Is he? Huh. Even if we do get him though I think he'd be depth, and we'd want a starting LB still.",Manchester City,Yes,j70l2uo,t1_j708f55
Yeah it's not great. I wish Esbrand was trusted as much as Rico is but Pep knows ball the best obviously.,Manchester City,Yes,j6zolr8,t1_j6zm69t
"Oh for sure, hopefully once we get proper replacement at LB (if that ever happens) then we could see it.",Manchester City,Yes,j70mbu0,t1_j70m2hb
Are you left footed?,Manchester City,Yes,j6z9svw,t1_j6z3y34
The evidence presented in this case is way too hard to ignore tho,Manchester City,Yes,j6xl7ot,t1_j6xl0mk

Absolutely i agree,Manchester City,Yes,j70d3x9,t1_j6yw4ui
I don't think it's impossible they would be willing to sell. I just think if you sign him you need to sign another because he will 100% get injured.,Manchester City,Yes,j6yjxbt,t1_j6ygmew
"I think he could work his way to starting. He's like a left footed Walker. very very pacy. Saw something today that Fulham set the price as 20 million for City?? Might be BS, but if that is the case, that is honestly a no brainer signing. 

He was born/raised in England, but wasn't good enough for England,  hence USMNT. (thats how a lot of our players are) Thats got to count as home grown...",Manchester City,Yes,j70mwfq,t1_j70l2uo

"Great “fans voice” perspective pod. Very honest and forthright. Less polished than Blue Moon Podcast but just as insightful if not more so. Only time where it loses me is when they start going on about media conspiracies against us - which, fair enough a lot of us feel that way about the media with good reason. But it’s the tone in which those discussions happen… I can’t quite put my finger on it, but not for me Clive. It is for lots of us though.",Manchester City,Yes,j6xh8xg,t1_j6xed71
"Genuinely not too sure, I haven't really listened to much aside from why always us. I assume it's pretty good based on it being one of the more heard of pods. Doesn't look like they post the whole thing on Spotify annoyingly though, except for their Friday show

"Better to have a very good player with the right attitude than an excellent one with a toxic mentality.

good for Cancelo. He's gonna slay it in the Bundasliga since they don't play defense there. If he doesn't have the mental fortitude for the Pep and the PL, then enjoy life in a smaller league. He's not going to grow up from this, and has left other teams in similar ways. Glad to have gotten a few good years out of him.",Manchester City,No,j6tprj8,t3_10qwrpb

"**From Sam Lee's recent Athletic article  on future of City players:** Summary of sorts.

>>***A rating of 1-10***, *10 being the safest, and 1 concerning. No 10 and 1 on the list, because nothing's certain in football.*

**Mahrez**: **8/10**. A good example for players on bench that their time to perform will come. 


**Ederson**: **9/10**, **Ortega 9/10**


**Walker:  5/10**. He is disgruntled at losing his place in the team since the World Cup, also is getting old.


**Ake: 9/10**. His attitude when not picked by Pep last season delighted Pep. Been one of our most consistent starters.


**Laporte: 6/10**. In Jan 2021 he asked to go, but nothing really materialised. Also been unhappy with his game time in recent weeks. His future is dependent on how much he starts until the next transfer window.


**Dias: 9/10**. He is a *key* voice in the dressing room. He is not on Pep's list of concerns. 


**Stones: 8/10**. Pep blamed Stones for his injury against arsenal, but nothing's out of ordinary. Safe.


**Akanji: 9/10**. Getting plenty starts. 

**Cancelo: 3/10**. Very unlikely that he will be back in the city squad next season. 


**Gomez: 4/10**. Not yet at City's level, and considered by City as somebody who could be moved on in the next transfer seasons. Loan likely, transfer not off the table either. 

**Rodri: 9/10**. No issues with him. 


**Kevin de Bruyne: 9/10**. No issues with him either.

**Gundogan: 6/10**. His contract expires next season, is 32, is he is attracting suitors from Barcelona among other European clubs. Gundo himself is keen to stay, however. His wife about to give birth, so he would want stability.


**Silva: 5/10**. Would leave if we get a good offers for him, ""preferably from Spain"".


**Phillips: 5/10**. Rumblings from the club that a transfer is not off the cards. He has to prove himself in the eyes of the club if he wants to stay. 


**Foden: 9/10**. Ofcourse. He is city through and through. 


**Julian: 9/10**. Might sign a new & better contract here, if anything. 


**Haaland: 9/10**. No concerns whatsoever. 


**Jacky Grealish: 9/10**. He is a key part of Pep's plan, and is more than happy at City. 


**Palmer: 6/10**. Fewer minutes under his belt compared to last season. City has noted a drop in his confidence, possibly due to injury that kept him out of second half of the season. City are looking for a winger, so palmer's future is uncertain. Might go on a loan.",Manchester City,No,j6whscf,t3_10qwrpb
"The sub has recently been stuck with such low effort posts. Stupid analysis, stupid farewell, Haaland tik toks. The quality has been a significant drop. Most of the posts should rather be in daily discussion, such are their quality.",Manchester City,No,j6sevqz,t3_10qwrpb
Sick of the sight of him in that kit already,Manchester City,No,j6tjoz6,t3_10qwrpb
Cancelo great assist within 20 minutes for Bayerns opener. I'm hoping he plays to such a ridiculously high level for them that they'll just pay the 70M option. Not a high chance of that happening but they did spend 80M on Lucas Hernandez (who was a lot younger than Cancelo though),Manchester City,No,j6tk279,t3_10qwrpb
Guys he’s playing against Mainz ffs. If we played Mainz rn we’d win 8-0 stop sucking him off now wanting him to come back,Manchester City,No,j6tr1gp,t3_10qwrpb
Who’s our ideal LB  target for the summer transfer window?? Looks to me like Sergio Gomez might leave on loan or something and the whole cancelo situation doesn’t make it any better.,Manchester City,No,j6sm0yc,t3_10qwrpb
"He must've truly pissed Pep off to be sent packing. We all know he's world class on the ball. He caused issues in the Portugal and City sides, it seems. Hate losing him. I imagine he would've come back to form, won his place back. Can't blame Pep. You have to play your best players, and he was not in form.",Manchester City,No,j6tn4ce,t3_10qwrpb
Not a fan of the news of Walker supposedly leaving in the summer,Manchester City,No,j6tu1na,t3_10qwrpb
"Imagine if Cancelo had the personality of David Silva. We'd literally have the LB spot locked down for another 6 years if that was the case, but the guy is his own worst enemy.

Talent isn't the issue with him, clearly. I thought he had turned a new leaf coming to City, seeing how passionate he was about the club, but it seems his mentality is easy to shatter. If Bayern do get him they're gonna learn in a couple of years.",Manchester City,No,j6tua1d,t3_10qwrpb
can’t tell if this is the bayern sub or the city sub,Manchester City,No,j6tpy9a,t3_10qwrpb
"Looking back at the Amazon doc and the Champions again doc, the club will have 3 potential transfers lined up for each position, if they thought we could get to the end of the season before going for a replacement for Cancelo then we have to trust 2 things. 

1] That there is a replacement in mind, and they will be very very good. 

2] They fully trust whatever pep decides with regards to holding LB down until the Summer.",Manchester City,No,j6szor2,t3_10qwrpb
Bayern getting a world class player capable of reviving their season for free is annoying. Couldn't we have signed Coman on loan or something? They've got so much pace in their squad.,Manchester City,No,j6tm657,t3_10qwrpb
"Saw Moneyball again yesterday and hope anyone that thinks all we need is a world class player in XYZ position to solve our problems watches it too. For example, Cancelo’s talented and that’s why he played for us, but he’s not what we need to succeed this season. Surprised how difficult that is proving for some people. 

The aim is to build a squad that wins, not a squad of galacticos. Winning is not an afterthought after building a squad, the squad is built to win.",Manchester City,No,j6v2fav,t3_10qwrpb
"Guys, if you loved Cancelo that much, go support Bayern then instead of posting his clips on here and going ""Boohoo come back please 😭""

He fucked about and found out, it's as simple as that.",Manchester City,No,j6tpa9k,t3_10qwrpb
Spurs away on Sunday lads(big game) this is pivotal as we can keep a bit of momentum going in the league. My main concern is who do we start at defense???,Manchester City,No,j6tje97,t3_10qwrpb

"The issue with that is Txiki was sure we could get our CB target Koulibaly. Napoli didn't play ball. He was sure we would get our striker target Kane, Spurs didn't play ball. He was sure we would solve our LB issues by getting in Cucurella. Brighton didn't play ball. 

I don't doubt they have replacements in mind but I think Txiki maybe overestimates our position sometimes and seemingly thinks things will easily get done, and when it turns out they don't, they turn to the 'don't panic buy' mantra, which is fine but if it keeps happening, you end up where we currently are, where you haven't had a nailed LB starter since Kolorov. 

I think he needs to have a shortlist of several players we would be happy to get because he misses out on our primary target quite a bit. Maguire, Sanchez, Jorginho, Fred. Whatever you may think of the players they were big targets for us and we didn't get it done. Maybe we don't get Bellingham done either? 

Maybe Pep can get away with not having a plan B and sticking to his philosophy, but I think Txiki needs a plan B and C if we're going to strengthen the squad in the way it needs to be.",Manchester City,Yes,j6tj7bf,t1_j6szor2
We've never really depended on any one player under Pep. I think some people are just using the Cancelo saga as an excuse to vent frustration. If our form doesn't improve expect it to get worse.,Manchester City,Yes,j6w7zdi,t1_j6v2fav
"The problem was Moneyball didn't win trophies. The A's are very average now and have been for a long time. Sure they got lucky with the Zito/Hudson/Mulder/Tejada/Chavez stretch but never made the World Series in the Moneyball era. Their last pennant was 1990! The true winner of that movie was Billy Beane... gets to flex for life cause Brad Pitt played him in the film. (also, Moneyball is a great book)

Seems like he is out of favour and don't know why. Now they got Gordon too.,Manchester City,Yes,j6tced9,t1_j6t9tvp
He's already looking a lot better these days... and I've noticed who's been at LB as he's improved....Turns out Jack operates a lot better when his space isn't being occupied,Manchester City,Yes,j6x0g2p,t1_j6wp7of
Wdym? I think he absolutely fits the Pep system,Manchester City,Yes,j6t8dgv,t1_j6t1syb
"I think it's time to move on from 100 million+ players to be fair. Not like the club is strapped for cash or anything but those deals almost never work out, or don't deliver 100 million value (See Grealish - He's been good this season but there's no way you watch him play and think we couldn't have gotten someone to do the same things for 40-50 million). 

Instead, use the money and get two 50 million players or three 40 million players. Spreads the risk, doesn't put pressure on any player and you can actually get value for money spent.",Manchester City,Yes,j6t3hq2,t1_j6t1syb
What do you mean Pep won’t be here in 2 years?,Manchester City,Yes,j6trfbl,t1_j6t1syb
"Bro even i miss him too but some of the guys here are saying stuff like pep is too egoistic and he should've forgiven cancelo for disrespecting him. If pep had done that, players would view him differently and it's not in a good way.",Manchester City,Yes,j6tz6vd,t1_j6tq8zl
"City fans are spiteful lol. It is what it is.

I miss him as much as you do bro. Will join you in getting downvoted but we should’ve given him more PT to keep him happy. 

Oh well.",Manchester City,Yes,j6tr5x7,t1_j6tq8zl
The last thing we need is another glass-made defender who is constantly going to have spells out.,Manchester City,Yes,j6thqhj,t1_j6taamo
"Lucas primary position will always be as a cb, he's injury prone too. Theo is more suited to play as lb. If we wanna keep playing  cb as lb, like we are doing with ake, Lucas might be a good option.",Manchester City,Yes,j6tj43e,t1_j6taamo
Lucas is Bayerns best defender and has been a starter for 2 seasons straight. He is always great for them when healthy.,Manchester City,Yes,j6tkcnf,t1_j6taamo
"Because he is injured all the time, and Bayern will want to recoup the 80m they paid for him.",Manchester City,Yes,j6vc4w6,t1_j6taamo
just driving his price up :),Manchester City,Yes,j6tktsh,t1_j6tkaa3
imagine the shitshow he would cause if he was sent to the reserves lol,Manchester City,Yes,j6tn724,t1_j6tmy0n
"What do you mean? Did anyone ever doubt his footballing ability? 

You can think someone is a helmet and still understand they’re a good player, look no further than Zlatan and Suarez for that.",Manchester City,Yes,j6tkwdn,t1_j6tkrvt
"Oh you should see what city fans are saying on twitter, some are Pep out, and for what? an assist? I wouldn't even swap prime messi for Pep.",Manchester City,Yes,j6txjko,t1_j6tx0tv
Yeah Foden will come back;,Manchester City,Yes,j6ul4il,t1_j6u42xn
Tbh it feels like we're cursed in that stadium,Manchester City,Yes,j6t2wca,t1_j6svunc
"Lmfao I’m getting there, I remember being like “what the fuck has this club come to in the past 3 days”",Manchester City,Yes,j6tcu0d,t1_j6sy6ni
"You don't really need it and it is common to have it removed if problems develop.

https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gallbladder-removal/#:~:text=The%20gallbladder%20is%20a%20small,develop%20any%20problems%20with%20it.",Manchester City,Yes,j6sgu3z,t1_j6sey4c
I don't see how that's related,Manchester City,Yes,j6tsdbe,t1_j6ts9mk
Sosa is not bad seen him in the WC and he played good for Croatia,Manchester City,Yes,j6snqeh,t1_j6sn187
Big IF but I’d rather cash in on him while he still has good value. Don’t get me wrong he’s a good footballer but it’s just the attitude aspect,Manchester City,Yes,j6sqwxp,t1_j6sp0o5
Man can’t defend to save his life,Manchester City,Yes,j6stiyc,t1_j6srz50
Guierro from Dortmund. Perfect pep inverted fullback. But he is bit injury prone and shaky defensively.,Manchester City,Yes,j6tcvzd,t1_j6snm8b
[referencing this](https://twitter.com/Doozy_45/status/1620811242494660608),Manchester City,Yes,j6tvjx1,t1_j6tum3t
"Same way they had a clear plan in the summer and brought in Gomez who's just as good as the academy kids?

Look it's possible the club isn't panic buying because they feel okay with the squad and have no plan for anyone in the summer for LB, and that's still okay.",Manchester City,Yes,j6t3yic,t1_j6t0ksk
"I'm confident that if a player doesn't have a release clause or is available on a free, we won't get them because Txiki isn't afraid to walk. And you know what, fairs. We don't have to compete with clubs anymore. You either want to come or you don't.

If/When Pep leaves, we'll see if we have to go back to that model",Manchester City,Yes,j6ubm06,t1_j6tj7bf
"Mate, they’re not the only team that applied that method. The other team was the Red Sox, and they did quite well. Do some research at least.",Manchester City,Yes,j6yi4jt,t1_j6vktqy
"He was starting ahead of who, Pavard or Maz? He's better than both of course he starts. Most of our side starts ahead of many players anywhere",Manchester City,Yes,j6uam39,t1_j6tr60h
Finding out is leaving Man City but go ahead and twerk some more for Bayern and the bundesliga dumbass,Manchester City,Yes,j6trxzx,t1_j6tr60h
"Can’t tell if this is serious or not. Almost anyone on the city squad would start at any other club so it’s not like we were expecting him to ride the bench.

If anything this just confirms Bayern are shit and needed our back up to help out with their disappointing season.

Somewhat sarcastic but also somewhat serious lol",Manchester City,Yes,j6txa00,t1_j6tr60h
You lost mate? The Bayern dick-sucking competition is next door.,Manchester City,Yes,j6u6hdy,t1_j6tr60h
Mbappe gonna feast on that. big time,Manchester City,Yes,j6tq0hf,t1_j6tknin
"Good, it sounds ridiculous",Manchester City,Yes,j6sdjop,t1_j6sbvkg
"its kinda growing on me ngl, great player",Manchester City,Yes,j6siise,t1_j6sayka
"Probably in the preparation in case of KDB blip. His form this season is soo inconsistent. Unlike past season, even when he play badly, he does give moment of brilliant during the game but this season, while getting a lot of assist, his overall performance kind of falling off.",Manchester City,Yes,j6t62nl,t1_j6sayka
Because he doesn’t take well to being told what to do,Manchester City,Yes,j6tiiah,t1_j6tced9
"Pep would find a way to fit Bellingham in, but he's not a Guardiola midfielder. Pedri and Gavi are, but barca would never sell",Manchester City,Yes,j6tbesz,t1_j6t8dgv
"I agree that some city fans are going a bit far but it's ridiculous to play players just to keep them happy when they're playing for all trophies. U play the players that deserve it, not out of form players that just strop in training",Manchester City,Yes,j6tuujn,t1_j6tr5x7
"Lol stay strong bro, we in this together",Manchester City,Yes,j6twuzm,t1_j6tr5x7
30+5m bid from Bayern is gonna hit like crack.,Manchester City,Yes,j6tkysc,t1_j6tktsh
Or u23 team? What can he do then,Manchester City,Yes,j6tnclz,t1_j6tn724
"Yes, people very much were doubting his football ability on here. I didn’t, but others thought he was washed up. 

He’s a very good player and will do very well at Bayern. It was a mistake to bench him imo, but whatever.",Manchester City,Yes,j6trek7,t1_j6tkwdn
"People here said that Cancelo is not all that lol

I still wish his situation was handled differently",Manchester City,Yes,j6to6lv,t1_j6tkwdn
City twitter can be as entitled as fuck,Manchester City,Yes,j6tzhk3,t1_j6txjko
Yikes that's absurd. i would swap every player in this city lineup except maybe foden and Kdb for pep lifetime contract lol,Manchester City,Yes,j6txs5f,t1_j6txjko
Lack of a cheese room is crippling for us,Manchester City,Yes,j6timuv,t1_j6t2wca
Wow. We learn something everyday.,Manchester City,Yes,j6shz33,t1_j6sgu3z
Cancelo UCL trophy pics would be a nightmare,Manchester City,Yes,j6tsmik,t1_j6tsdbe
wanna see bayern get knocked out in the next round.,Manchester City,Yes,j6tshks,t1_j6tsdbe
"also Joško Gvardiol

if u/_stone_age

is right about what we're doing with fullbacks now then he would be perfect i think. Interested if i understood what you were saying properly stone and if im right that he would be perfect for that",Manchester City,Yes,j6so93x,t1_j6snqeh
"https://preview.redd.it/qat0m4970pfa1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c4e14f8dd2748b110c4619e09c57858841b722f8

arda guler swap deal? 🙏",Manchester City,Yes,j6u4qyc,t1_j6tvjx1
"Gomez is the outlier in buying cover when we need it and it not immediately being a perfect fit, I’ve still got faith in his ability to be fair. He’s unproven, not amazing or dogshit.

So I’d say no, not the same way.",Manchester City,No,j6t4qj1,t1_j6t3yic
"I feel like we will (go back to that model) without the pull of Pep anymore. I think it'll be harder to attract players to us over other teams personally, at least than it is right now, because other clubs can pay the same wages we can etc. 

There's so much market competition now, even at the top top end of the game that, whilst it's fine to walk away from deals you don't think work for you, there is an increasingly limited player pool to choose from. Because players are already settled or bought.",Manchester City,Yes,j6ujnas,t1_j6ubm06
City fan and always have been but go off buddy.,Manchester City,Yes,j6u9yjb,t1_j6u6hdy
He doesn't like to track back i guess,Manchester City,Yes,j6tj8d0,t1_j6tiiah
He'll go for between 40m - 50m.,Manchester City,Yes,j6ucgut,t1_j6tkysc
Madrid needs a RB. Maybe a swap for Camavinga,Manchester City,Yes,j6tlo1d,t1_j6tkysc
if they can cough up 70m for de ligt they can cough up 50m plus for cuntcelo,Manchester City,Yes,j6tmt7w,t1_j6tkysc
unfortunately binning him on loan and selling in the summer is probably the best case scenario,Manchester City,Yes,j6tno55,t1_j6tnclz
"It wasn’t a mistake to bench him though imo. Pep starts 11s that earn it in training, that fit the gameplay and usually that are in form. 

By all accounts Cancelo hits 1/3 of those things. Cancelo doesn’t get to start just because he’s world class. 

World class with an attitude problem and not on form doesn’t get into a pep team and nor should it.",Manchester City,Yes,j6trqaf,t1_j6trek7
one fugazi cross wont make him a competent defender unfortunately,Manchester City,Yes,j6tpxz6,t1_j6to6lv
I love KDB (*hence my username*) but Pep lifetime contract sounds more tempting ngl,Manchester City,Yes,j6ty07e,t1_j6txs5f
KdB who?,Manchester City,Yes,j6uftu1,t1_j6txs5f
After dropping a 10/10 performance on our head :),Manchester City,Yes,j6tszjp,t1_j6tsmik
Ah fuck. Messi PTSD incoming,Manchester City,Yes,j6tsvyt,t1_j6tshks
I’ve heard a lot of good things about Gvardiol how good is he going forward???,Manchester City,Yes,j6srgnf,t1_j6so93x
Source reliable? I doubt,Manchester City,Yes,j6vqz4c,t1_j6u4qyc
"Gomez as LB for us is the equivalent of Arsenal getting Sambi Lokonga as backup DM to Partey. Both young players from Anderlecht who just don't have it in them at the moment to start at their current clubs. 

Sambi has been sent on loan, Gomez should've been sent on loan too.",Manchester City,Yes,j6t56nq,t1_j6t4qj1
Pep wants a team of orchestral players and ASM is a big fan of free jazz. It’ll never work,Manchester City,Yes,j6tvu8o,t1_j6tj8d0
"Ngl he fits our criteria, another midfielder playing as a lb lol",Manchester City,Yes,j6tm0vc,t1_j6tlo1d
"Yeah but our board sucks at selling players, so always assume the lowest.",Manchester City,Yes,j6tn3rr,t1_j6tmt7w
"With him as an inverted rb alongside kimmich sounds like trouble man, hope PSG pounds them.",Manchester City,Yes,j6tnz1q,t1_j6tno55
He doesn’t need to be defensively perfect though. Walker provided the balance defensively while he provided offensively. They complemented each other perfectly.,Manchester City,Yes,j6tq8oz,t1_j6tpxz6
"Yeah kinda same but Kdb made me love this sport more than any other player lol, fuck this sounded cringey asf",Manchester City,Yes,j6ty6xq,t1_j6ty07e
De bruyne?,Manchester City,Yes,j6ufxyw,t1_j6uftu1
"Man can’t defend, basically a Portuguese Trent. 

If he drops a 10/10 it’s all going forward…think he cost us 6 or so points this year trying to defend lol",Manchester City,Yes,j6tudln,t1_j6tszjp
"Well what stone age is saying is basically that our left back won't go forward that much with Rico being the one that goes forward. This is what ake is doing now


But he's a pretty good LB tbh, and CB. So to me he would fit perfectly if that's really what we want to do",Manchester City,Yes,j6sruq4,t1_j6srgnf
"Maybe, but I’m not going to die on a hill defending him like some fans do writing him off like he’s played more than 5 league games for us.",Manchester City,Yes,j6t5ffs,t1_j6t56nq
He would have been sent on loan if they got Cucurella...,Manchester City,Yes,j6tqg35,t1_j6t56nq
"im a firm believer in the sane cl curse, so im not worried yet.",Manchester City,Yes,j6toqyd,t1_j6tnz1q
"Cancelo directly lost us the match against Liverpool this year for his terrible defending.

Want to say there was another match he shit the bed in trying to defend but I can’t recall the exact match. I think the majority of matches he played in for city resulted in losses or draws.

He’ll be fine at Bayern going forward but wasn’t cutting it for pep. Adios amigo!",Manchester City,Yes,j6tykn0,t1_j6tq8oz
"It's okay to simp for KDB, it's a city sub afterall haha",Manchester City,Yes,j6tycri,t1_j6ty6xq
joke,Manchester City,Yes,j6uhrjk,t1_j6ufxyw
"Contrary to what people here say about cancelo, I always defended him. He is a brilliant player. Always was. But I don't want him anywhere near our team if he is as toxic as the club says he is. Don't care. Club is always bigger than a player.",Manchester City,Yes,j6tuz2u,t1_j6tudln
"To be fair, it's always difficult to trust defensive players because their errors are technically more costly for the team so I understand those fans. 

Grealish and Mahrez can play like shit all they want and come good later on in the season but they don't directly cost us goals so people aren't too bothered with giving them a run of games to gain form.

A bag game for Gomez might mean we concede a silly goal and drop points in a very tight league race. Everyone blames Gomez, his confidence takes a hit, and he's even worse the next time he gets a chance.",Manchester City,Yes,j6t714e,t1_j6t5ffs
">Want to say there was another match he shit the bed in

Fulham, Southampton",Manchester City,Yes,j6uaw91,t1_j6tykn0
"What? He’s won matches for us many times over. Cancelo did mess up in some matches, but to say that majority of the matches that he featured on ended in either losses or draw is a straight up lie.",Manchester City,Yes,j6u1834,t1_j6tykn0
You have your right to defend the player for sure but I can’t argue he was good at defending.,Manchester City,Yes,j6tv9zo,t1_j6tuz2u
"Sorry mate, I meant to say his performance from this year*** not overall.

Played in the league cup - we lost 
Played in the derby - we lost
Played against Brentford - we lost
Played against Fulham - red card
Played against Liverpool - we lost",Manchester City,Yes,j6u30y3,t1_j6u1834
"True, he’s cost us a lot in this season",Manchester City,Yes,j6u38dc,t1_j6u30y3
Sorry about that. I think he’s great going forward but I’m excited to see us play now that this all behind everyone. Looking forward to spurs!,Manchester City,Yes,j6u3hbx,t1_j6u38dc
We have one Erling Haaland to look forward to 🤝,Manchester City,Yes,j6vwygm,t1_j6u3hbx
