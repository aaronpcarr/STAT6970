I wish the pre and post match presser asked more about tactics and ideas rather than the circus of news around the games.

"Taking a moment to rant about getting tickets this season as a member. Why the hell was the Leeds game behind point gates? I've only managed to get to one game this season (Salzburg) and am desperate to take my dad to one (I promised as a birthday present) and it's just become so bloody hard this year, especially without the cup games we had last year. Prem games have always been difficult but adding points gates to the non-big 6 / rivals matches is just crippling more and more opportunities.

I'd also say Kante could be good, because he covers play well but can also roam forward (and then Enzo could cover). When we need to break teams down having two AMs ready to prowl forward could make the difference.",Chelsea,Yes,j7add71,t1_j7abqs3

They are not wrong. He's more of a 8 who proclivity in the LHS. 

>Assuming we want to try him out at 8 who do we pair him up in midfield with? 

Someone of a destroyer playing style. A young Casemiro/Fernandinho/Fabinho kind. I dunno if there is someone of that calibre left in Brazil or South America. There are also some fine Africa originated players (Soumare, Onana, Kone). I think we should be trying Trevor in that role till Kante returns and we get someone like Rice in the summer. Sorry I completely forgot Zakaria. Probably due to his injury history. 

>Does it look like a Matic-Fabregas pair

Sort of. 

>Think we should curb spending in the next window and make sure the potter project is on track before taking next steps?

I believe the project is on the right track so far (55%). 15% for the 3 positions we need to strengthen (DM, AM, CF) and 30% for the clear out - which is the main issue, because I can think of a XI who should go on loaned or be sold.",Chelsea,Yes,j7afeko,t1_j7abqs3

"It's funny how we've sort of accepted that being 9/10 is part of the process, also we've had  a similar injury crisis and finished 4th last season. But winning 3/4 games out of 20 is all part of a plan and not the manager being shit.",Chelsea,Yes,j7a9cj6,t1_j7a76ub

Our issues are in the midfield third and ball progression. While our wingers aren't necessarily Hazard 1 Vs 1 players like Sterling have been very good over the years stretching the pitch and beating fullbacks by being isolated 1 Vs 1 so the problem is further back imo.

"There's a reason why, despite having the most talented squad we've had in years, England still can't be ball dominant against elite opposition. A midfield three of Rice, Mount, and Gallagher would basically be tacitly accepting we don't want the ball and we just want to sit deep and absorb pressure. Yet these are the players a lot of fans want populating our middle third.

Mount was at his best in the 343, left inside forward position. He was adept at receiving under pressure, back to goal, and linking up with others on the half-turn. It's a pretty niche skillset to be honest (Ziyech, for example, fucking sucks at it). The onus on those inside forwards to be creative is offset by the fact that they are also meant to enable the wingbacks to overload the widths of the pitch. They're primarily meant to receive the ball, drag players away from the wingbacks so that the wingbacks are always the spare man out wide. But outside of that role, he's not comfortable enough linking up play earlier in phases of possession, nor does he have a reliable final ball required for facing the play in the final third of the pitch. He's a solid all-rounder who excels in a very specific position.

He cannot bear a majority of our team's creative duties. It's a poor use of his skillset. Given these facts, I don't see the rationale for giving him a contract comparable to James, who on most metrics is an anomaly.",Chelsea,Yes,j7awon8,t1_j7avf03

"Well rested? We‚Äôve had so many injuries all year. Potters getting better results with fucking Gallagher and Mount playing in the midfield every game.

I think you‚Äôre a little delusional. For us to even be 10th is a miracle at the moment with all the injuries and how shit our midfield and attack has been all year. We‚Äôre improving defensively, we‚Äôve got new attackers that are going to be game changers, and we‚Äôre slowly but surely getting healthier. 

It‚Äôs not hard to see that Potter has good game plans, the players just fail at literally everything he tries. Comes down to not being good enough at the end of the day.

Enjoying Burnley was the opposite of enjoying football, cause their aim was always to limit time that is actually spent on playing football during the game. I don't doubt that there are people who liked Burnley for the amount of butthurt they cause to rival fans, but they didn't actually like watching them play.",Chelsea,Yes,j7adpz9,t1_j7abdbk
First thing how do we counter if every team we play that's not in the top 6 decides to sit back? We still have to break them down for the first goal,Chelsea,Yes,j7bb6if,t1_j7barcg
Gallagher played further up the pitch as a 10 most of the time for Palace. Mount plays as our ‚Äú10‚Äù but they‚Äôre both awful in transition. Both are too slow and make too many i necessary touches.

"I'm just looking at stats at transfermarkt, and looking among players with most appereances in each season since 19/20 (Mount's senior debut at Chelsea) it looks as follows.

Mount - 227 appereances

Bruno Fernandes - 226 appereances

Bernardo Silva - 218 appereances

Rodri - 215 appereances

Raheem Sterling - 205 appereances

Mo Salah - 201 appereances

Harry Maguire - 198 appereances

Declan Rice - 191 appereances

Phil Phoden - 189 appereances

Aside from Sterling (who mostly played for City during that time) no Chelsea did cross 200 games in that period of time.

Kai Havertz has 195, Jorginho 192, Azpi 185 appereances, Thiago Silva has 174 appereances (which is impressive in it's own way, given his age). 

So yeah, Mount is by far the most exploited players in our club, and one of the most if not most exploited in general. 

DISCLAIMER: I was not looking at goalkeepers and also didn't look at other leagues, given there are less opportunities to play games for them, e.g. there's only one domestic cup in other countries, Bundesliga plays only 34 games a season etc.",Chelsea,Yes,j7ckncx,t1_j7cejhn

Mourinho and Ferguson also said nearly exactly the same thing,Chelsea,Yes,j7cu3yk,t1_j7crbwl
"Exactly. It's too easy to blame it on Haaland. 

There are way too many variables in football when it comes to form. For example, are their other players their usual selves? De Bruyne certainly isn't playing at the same level. They also have problems with their defence as Diaz and Laporte are struggling with form, and they've just lost Cancelo. And we have to realise that the majority of this squad has been playing at an extremely high level for years, and a slight regression is only normal (no team dominates the PL every year).

But Haaland certainly does make them play differently. And I don't think they've fully adapted to suit him yet ‚Äì which is terrifying. They often don't find his runs in behind and he's making them *all* game.",Chelsea,Yes,j7dexra,t1_j7cxhua

">Makes no sense at all. Conte took us from 10th to title winners in 1 season. Tuchel took the players struggling at 9th under Lampard to Champions league winner in the same season.

>You see the difference? 5 months under Potter and we still don't know what system and identity he wants to implement.

The difference is neither Tuchel nor Conte had to deal with 6 - 9 injuries per game. It is difficult to have a stable system with unstable players.",Chelsea,Yes,j7akabl,t1_j7ajlme

Don‚Äôt mention Brighton because Potter finished 9th with them and went 3 months without winning or even sometimes scoring a single goal at the Amex. 
Don‚Äôt mention injuries because every single team goes through injuries, and even through injuries we have been lucky to have players like Havertz, Koulibaly, Silva, etc. Potter has always had world class players at his disposal despite injuries.

And after all that ‚Äúfantastic job‚Äù he supposedly did, Brighton have still not won anything, and De Zerbi is coaching them much better than Potter ever did. Just ask Brighton fans if they‚Äôd want Potter back.",Chelsea,Yes,j7a55yb,t1_j7a4nz6

"Fuck off you weird Bot.

Pretending that some random rumour that Tuchel committed some heinous unrevealable act and had to be sacked on the spot has any credibility is absolutely hilarious when it was clearly just a click bait throw away comment on talk sport.

Pep always praises shit managers after he whips them comfortably. He wasn't praising Tuchel when Tommy beat him 3 times in a row including the CL final.

The worst season of Tuchels entire managerial career has been better than Potters best season, not one other club on the planet would have took Potter over Tuchel if given the choice between both their careers really speak for themselves.",Chelsea,Yes,j7clci2,t1_j7ckom7
"You Tuchel fanboys seriously need to get over him!  He was sacked for being a difficult person to work with.  He got himself fired.  So all your crying is just wasted breath, because HE IS NOT COMING BACK!",Chelsea,Yes,j7adl53,t1_j7aclun
"He won the swedish variant of the league cup or fa cup (where he bested top flight teams)

He also took them from lower divisions to the highest playing an expansive brand of fotball

He also took said team in the european success

First he managed to get trough playoffs to Europa League for the groupstage (besting poak, galatasaray in the process) then in the group stage they finished 2nd (equal points to bilbao)

Then he went into the playoffs where he managed to beat arsenil at emirates but loosing by a goal over 2 legs.

He clearly did a great job there, and he should have a lot of credit for it.

For me this was alot more impressive then what he did at brighton (knowing swedish and pl fotball)

That beeing said, if we manage to keep most of this squad healthy I want to see an increase in chance creation, or he has to go.",Chelsea,Yes,j7ada40,t1_j7aclun

"Dumbasses are falling over themselves to think of excuses why Potter can't be expected to win any game.

Someone on this sub yesterday said Dyche has it easy at Everton and it's no surprise he beat Arsenal in his first game because he has a group of players that know the league but we can't expect to win games or us to score a goal 5 months after Potter  took over because he's had so much money to spend and so many new players.",Chelsea,Yes,j7bc9wv,t1_j7banlp

"A lot of teams make do with 2 same footed players, but ideally, any team that plays from the back wants 1 left footed and 1 right footed CBs for optimal passing angles. Easier to build and evade press that way. Also left footed players are usually always used at the left side of defence because how rare they are. 

Arsenal's starting CB pairing consists of Gabriel (L) and Saliba (R) with Kwior (L) and White (R) as backups. United's starting CB pair are Martinez (L) and Varane (R). City have Laporte and Ake as left footed CBs and although their defensive rotation is weird this season, both have been signed for the reason I listed above. Real Madrid's starters at CB are Alaba (L) and Militao (R). Bayern had Hernandez (L) and De Ligt (R) until Hernandez got injured.",Chelsea,Yes,j7bu0cv,t1_j7bpokv
"u/Lazyan was right, I was a fool for thinking you would be receptive to feedback from someone who literally agrees with your support of Potter.",Chelsea,Yes,j7ajns7,t1_j7ai35i
"Lavia or Kone would be my pick, both are likely to be much cheaper, particulary Lavia if Southampton get relegated. Rice or Caicedo are very good mind you, but I just don‚Äôt see the need to splash that much money for the DM position.",Chelsea,Yes,j7avdx9,t1_j7au391
"I think Caicedo roams too much to be the best partner for Enzo. Macallister drops down to help create some solidity in that midfield. He is like Kante in that they both roam and collect the ball and do defensive duties all over the pitch. I like him and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll work if we did get him but for the price not sure if worth.

I think Rice is the obvious choice but money again Olaya a role and if we aren‚Äôt in CL I do think he goes to Arsenal. As he‚Äôs been saying he wants to play in that competition and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs moving.

Zubimendi has a 60mil release clause which isn‚Äôt cheap but he‚Äôs a certified DM and he‚Äôs Spanish so you can have midfielders who speak the same language communicating with each other. I think he looks good, is pretty good aerially despite his height and I think he can play in PL. he‚Äôs like a more physical busquets but less talented in progression.

Lavia could be a good option if City don‚Äôt think on buying him back which I do think they will if they get relegated. If he doesn‚Äôt get bought back, I think he would be a good option for.  Very raw still but has a lot of upside and is getting better each week.",Chelsea,Yes,j7becpm,t1_j7au391
"I'd guess that there will be three significant signings in the summer. 

One is Caicedo. Why? Well, his stats this season are comparable to Kante's throughout his career and he is precisely the type of midfielder we need. He's not an offensive outlet, but he is very good defensively. He'd be a great cover for Enzo in a midfield duo. 

One more midfielder. Somewhere between an offensive/creative outlet and a solid defender. Essentially a good box-to-box midfielder. Rice would be good here, but he would be very expensive and there are cheaper/as good players in this position. We also still have Kovacic, which makes it more likely that we'd go for a cheaper and younger alternative. I'd say that someone like Zubimendi would be a great addition, but keep in mind that we do have Casadei and Santos who could be a backup to Kova. 

We're certainly not going for a striker this season. We're going to have Nkunku in the summer with Fofana/Broja as backups + we still have Lukaku on the books. And I do expect that we'll sign Joao permanently who can also play up front. 

I also think we're unlikely to go for a new keeper. Keep does have his blunders, but statistically he's one of the best keepers in the league. His xG vs conceded goals is fantastic. Slonina is likely to be his backup/cup keeper. 

Generally, I'm not sure we \*need\* much more. What we need is time. Time for the players to settle into Premier League, learn each other's play and time for Potter to figure out how to play them. 

That game on Friday didn't much change my mind. This squad has the potential to be an absolute juggernaut, but it won't happen tomorrow. Of all the players we bought two resemble a finished product, Badiashile and Enzo. Why? They both played at high level and performed there. Everyone else needs time and most of the first team needs rest.",Chelsea,Yes,j7b1wv4,t1_j7au391
Kolo for sure,Chelsea,Yes,j7binx3,t1_j7b51xi
"Broja injury is so so frustrating

Rest of the season would have given us plenty time to assess his true level and see how he fits in with the rest of the new attack",Chelsea,Yes,j7avouo,t1_j7aux1o
I don‚Äôt think we are getting a new striker. Potter made a comment about our striker situation and said something like ‚Äúthe winners of the last 4/5 years didn‚Äôt have a true striker‚Äù so I think we do sign Felix and play him and Nkunku as rotating ‚Äústrikers‚Äù both off strikers playing off each other. Interesting how that‚Äôll go as both players better next to an actual striker but that‚Äôs what it looks like we‚Äôre going for if Potter is still around in the summer,Chelsea,Yes,j7bdjnw,t1_j7aux1o

"Wikipedia for meanings of words and phrases is new. Regardless, it doesn't contradict what I said. I said watching Burnley play was a guilty pleasure of mine and it is. Watching them frustrate Arsenal or City or Liverpool or United was hilarious and very very fun to watch. So I'm not taking it back. 

You're the one who took it to mean that liking his team means being a fan of Brexitball. Even though I mentioned, *one sentence earlier*, that my attraction was how it frustrated football hipsters.

I liked Zidane's Madrid and Nagelsmann's Leipzig too. It doesn't mean that I watched every match that they played. It meant that I would tune in to some matches if my time permitted. The same with Burnley playing a top 6 team.

You created a strawman from nothing that I said, called me a liar, and then are asking me to take what I said back because you are mad at someone who I never mentioned.",Chelsea,Yes,j7aekha,t1_j7adpz9

Our club was in more crisis last season in the last 2 decades.",Chelsea,Yes,j7akrmp,t1_j7akabl
"Insane revisionism, and blatantly untrue. Our injury crisis with Tuchel was far worse, and we were having to play players out of position constnalty (double pivot of fucking chalobah and mount lol).

Mount can‚Äôt defend as well as Henderson though nor is he half as positiknslly disciplined,Chelsea,Yes,j7bowg4,t1_j7bi73c
"It's not a bad shout. Mount has the engine but does he have Hendo's positional discipline or the nous in the tackle? Whenever we've pushed Mount deeper he's looked a little lost. I don't think he has Henderson's sense for when to keep things simple in deeper areas of the pitch and when to try a worldie. I'm not saying it wouldn't work but I do think it's not a coincidence that no manager wants him in the pivot (let alone as a 6). Most managers have elected to push him high up the pitch where his press and good first-touch on the half-turn can be utilised. Henderson on the other hand tends to sit much deeper and cover for TAA, as you say.

That said, maybe Klopp turns him into a Hendo? If there's anything to the Liverpool rumours.

And yeah, I think he's outta luck in a traditional 433. At least one 8 (normally the left-sided one) needs to have a final ball. He *could* be the 8 that has less creative responsibility, but he's been given the most whenever he's been one of the two 8s in a 433. But even then, the deeper or less creatively-responsible 8 needs to be more comfortable recycling the play and being progressive than Mount is (someone like a Kova or Kante).",Chelsea,Yes,j7bw6l8,t1_j7bi73c

Donkey touch for a 9 in a possession-based team. In transition he can be lethal. He'd do better at Spuds.,Chelsea,Yes,j7afa8w,t1_j7aemh1
"Extremely static and slow, does not look like he can compete at the top level. ik my 5m comment might seem like a joke but it's still cheaper than the rest of his contract. I'd let him go for free and cut our losses.",Chelsea,Yes,j7ahexq,t1_j7aemh1
"Problem with playing the 10 in a 4231 is whether Mount has a final ball or not.

He can hit a channel ball in transition but he's not going to regularly unlock low blocks, which is what a 10 in a 4231 that wants to be ball dominant has to do.",Chelsea,Yes,j7c5psx,t1_j7by4lp

The reality is we‚Äôre closer to relegation than top 4, and if that‚Äôs acceptable to you because of some ‚Äúprocess‚Äù that has NO guarantee of being a success, then you can fuck right off because you don‚Äôt deserve to be a fan.

"Imagine how different things would look if everyone you mentioned didn't sustain serious injuries. Livramento looked like a demon for S'ton, but now he's getting recovery setbacks from the ACL. Lamptey is perpetually on the treatment table. CHO has lost that 5 yard burst that made him electric in the youth setup. Rubes is doing okay but it's undeniable that he seems less mobile now than he was pre-achilles.

"I see the stats, but the players on the list should be seen with context of their team and the eye-test. 

For instance, Grealish is at the top. I would take a large number of players below him over him in the team, because he massively benefits from a system that enables him and others in his position to succeed.   
On the contrary, Chelsea had a slow year in offense and really fell behind after the UCL campaign. 
Reece is our best creator and he's just middle of the pack. Stands to reason that other Chelsea players would be much further below.  
I'll chalk CHO to a bit of supersub occurrences. 

But I get the point. Mount seems to have been built into prospering in a role within 3ATB which we don't (and likely wont) be using anymore, and doesn't seem to be able to outperform other players in the new role he needs to play.  
Yet. Hoping he can figure it out.",Chelsea,Yes,j7cii6x,t1_j7c5psx
"Lampard had Kante. I don‚Äôt think Kante has played a single game under Potter yet. Until Potter can have a consistent run with a consistent line up I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to call for his head.

"Maybe you should take a bit of a step back from football because you sound a bit deranged. 

Obviously I‚Äôd prefer we were doing better at the moment. But you must be new if you genuinely believe you can thrive with the current circumstances. Potter has to integrate half a squad of new signings with multiple key players out for prolonged periods of time. 

I‚Äôm all for Chelsea having a more sustainable long term approach rather than the previous cycles of success and mediocrity. 

We no longer have Roman to bail us out every other season. If you‚Äôve been paying attention you notice that we‚Äôre trying to put together a set up that will promote sustainable success. We have secured bright talents for the best part of a decade. We‚Äôve invested heavily in future youth prospects. We have a whole new scouting and technical director set up for the first time in ages. 

None of this is for instant success. You need to be patient otherwise don‚Äôt start celebrating 5 years down the line when we have back to back titles and minimal ongoing spending.",Chelsea,Yes,j7aewj5,t1_j7acgm6

It‚Äôll be better for your own mental health to accept that this is the manager we have and it‚Äôs going to need a bit of patience to see results.

"The coach clearly isn‚Äôt shit given his success in Sweden and Brightons progress. 

Is he elite? No, I‚Äôd agree with that. But it doesn‚Äôt mean he couldn‚Äôt be with time. 

As I‚Äôve said numerous times no manager would find it easy to integrate 6-7 new signings into the line up, with a World Cup half way through the season and having your best players injured for prolonged periods. 

Even when Felix came in he got suspended straight away - what‚Äôs Potter to do about that??",Chelsea,Yes,j7afil8,t1_j7af331

"Enzo is exactly what we needed, can't think of another player (maybe Kimmich) who can look like a natural anywhere in midfield. We can easily use him as a lone no6, he's simply excellent in and out of possession. But he probably would like a bit more freedom to show his progressive and offensive capabilities. 

Really glad the club decided to fork up the money for him because there's simply no alternative to him in the market.",Chelsea,No,j75o5hf,t3_10t6kdr
"I‚Äôm beginning to think Mount can‚Äôt even play a b2b midfielder. He crowded the spaces Havertz and Mudryk needed, successfully forcing the former to drop deep (if only he‚Äôd exploit the space left behind) and isolating the latter on the touch line. As if making 2 players appear worse than they were, him and Gallagher offered absolutely no help to Enzo who was at times unable to receive the ball or had to drop between the CBs. 

Misplacing passes and slow decision making are one thing but actively making 3 players play worse is a whole another problem that is alarming. I think I know the reason for it, Mount saw Enzo‚Äôs highlights and went ‚Äúso this guy spams through balls over the top, better make sure to be near the goal for one of them‚Äù.

Then there‚Äôs Gallagher who isn‚Äôt even playing bad for his standards but slows the game by his lack of football iq. He runs though.

As long as we will have Gallagher and Mount starting, the problems will persist. Sell Gallagher in the summer, get a proper pivot pairing for Enzo and decide what to do with Mount.

Zakaria, Kova and Felix can‚Äôt return soon enough.

Also very pleased with Madueke, and Enzo is just incredible. I slagged off Fofana yesterday for not passing to Havertz but he couldn‚Äôt have seen him, I apologise. Badiashile is an incredible signing, I had doubts on how he‚Äôll play without Silva but yesterday I saw him command and correct players‚Äô positioning on multiple occasions. I feel for him for not making the CL squad, he deserves it but we need others more.

Cucurella wasn‚Äôt great yesterday but gets too much hate. He has to cover for Mudryk and also help to put out fires in midfield. Often he was central to help Enzo and got exposed because Mudryk lost his runner. I like Enzo as a sole 6 but he needs a DM next to him to get the best of him. Even Kova would do, maybe even Santos if he adapts to the PL.

And lastly, and I apologise for a long post, no matter how excited we were for this match, it was always going to be a difficult one. Fulham are tough, well organised and intense whereas our squad was largely the same as it was the last time we faced them. New signings are not plug and play, we‚Äôre always going to struggle because of that in combination with the underperforming usual suspects and injuries. It‚Äôs a slow ascent, we‚Äôll be better with every game, it‚Äôs still a project. A lot of positives too, we kept 3 clean sheets in a row.",Chelsea,No,j760dgr,t3_10t6kdr

It may be that Chelsea hasn‚Äôt scored a lot of goals recently so everyone is pushing up the field to try and get one but my god we can‚Äôt play with only one guy in the midfield. Mount and Gallagher need to drop and learn the midfield dance with Enzo. FLUIDITY, that is what made xavi, iniesta, and busquets work so well.

Enzo was absolutely crazy. Even the stats don't do him justice. He was isolated and locked in the midfield and still impressed in a basically solo midfield, in only his secondary position.

Badiashile was great, and Silva was excellent in complementing him. It's always good to see a senior being the one to actually cover the new players and not vice versa.

Reece was solid although nothing stellar, which is more than enough for a recovering player.

Besides those, I also think the hate on Kai is unjustified. He's been getting on the end of passes and were unlucky with his shots, which admittedly also need improvements. I think normally he would've scored today.

"Let‚Äôs say everyone is fit and available. The back line needs little debate over who starts, so what do we do with our midfield? Double 6 or a 3 man midfield? Enzo is nailed on, who partners him and where does he play?

A double 6 is the best option based on the attackers we have imo. Either next to Kova/Kante and Enzo stays a bit behind; or next to Zakaria who offers more defensive cover (although we‚Äôve yet to see him as a DM) and Enzo gets more freedom? 

A midfield of 3 with Enzo as a 6, Kova and an another attacking b2b(although I don‚Äôt feel confident about any of remaining options). Or Enzo as an 8 next to another attacking b2b with a dm behind?

Either way, we will need to buy a mobile defensive midfielder in the summer. I think 4231 is the way to go from now on, we have starting quality wingers in Mudryk, Sterling, Madueke and Ziyech, and players that should be played behind the striker in the 10 role in Felix/Nkunku. Who do we go after? Enzo-Rice would be good but expensive, especially when Rice could be unnecessary against teams that sit deeper. I‚Äôm not exactly sold on Caicedo or Onana. Worth a thought, we have time until the summer.

What do we do with the striker situation? Havertz might come good but the Club must be running out of patience, I‚Äôm willing to give him time until the end of the season. If he leaves we will likely need 2 strikers if Broja doesn‚Äôt recover. Who do we buy that isn‚Äôt just a target man but can get involved in buildup and be fluid with surrounding players? Is Vlahovic good at that? His stats are poor but that could be due to Juve‚Äôs playsyle. I definitely don‚Äôt want to play Nkunku as a sole 9. What do we do?

Brighton who our owners rate so highly in terms of building a club etc has literally shown it, that it's not a player, a director, a staff member or a manager that's the key, the project itself is the key. You don't have to hold on to one of them to make it work, you make it work despite them, they add their own quality to it, but the project is independent.

"I keep seeing the sentiment that De Zerbi has unlocked a next level Brighton, and that this is proof of some inherent flaw with Potter proving he has a very low ceiling. I'm not even potter in but this narrative is so annoying when it can be pretty easily disproven looking at the numbers. For example, the spread for DZ's Brighton's last 10 PL games:

6W - 1D - 3L

GF: 23

GA: 16

GD: 7

&#x200B;

Now, compare that with Potter's last 10 PL games for Brighton before he left for Chelsea:

&#x200B;

7W - 2D - 1L

GF: 22

GA: 7

GD: 15

The revisionist history that Potter's Brighton could never score is just wrong. Maybe De Zerbi has them playing nominally more attacking football, but clearly at the expense of a consistently solid backline.

Why give him a bumper contract to ride the bench? Would rather take the 50 or 60m pure profit.

Our backline, depth and players to join are ridiculous, first choice players just need fitness. James and Chilwell don‚Äôt look their peak best by a long way, that comes with a few games for fitness.

Enzo sitting in midfield pinging balls about is one of the large missing pieces for creativity we needed. The second will be Felix on for Mount in central attacking mid making shit happen. Add two wide players around him who can run at defences, and a bit of familiarity and things become great.

We improve again when we match Enzo with a specialist defensive 6 to cover him and to add work rate and grit. Whether it‚Äôs Caicedo, Rice or whomever, it will happen in 5 months, as will the joining of Gusto, Nkunku and Santos.

We will improve immeasurably signing a top shelf striker who knows how to be a striker.

Felix still hasn‚Äôt played with Enzo and Mudryk, from the next match onwards our attack will start to look more creative and cohesive.

The main issues are that Havertz, Mount and Gallagher need to start riding the bench, and in the next few weeks we will have the players available and fit to make that a reality. Whatever individual situation they‚Äôre in, they‚Äôre causing our attacking moves to break down, they‚Äôre simply not offering enough value to start.

DD Fofana, Felix, Madueke are looking exciting and should be given their chance. Kova/Zakaria, when fit, needs to form a partnership with Enzo to cover him.

From next week onward things are going to start to look a lot better.

They haven't been in form in ages (playing constantly is probably a factor here - they've both missed just 1 PL game each) and as much as I like both they don't offer much at the moment, at least not in those positions. We have Fofana now, plop him up top, let Havertz operate as a 10 behind him. Give Mount a few games of rest and let Carney have a go. Anything at all, really - we all want to have a stable ""best 11"" that we can bet would give their 100%, but if someone is just not at that level at the moment he should definitely hit the bench",Chelsea,No,j77zeuf,t3_10t6kdr

Give Potter a month atleast to work with the 8 new signings. These players haven't played together at all. Not to mention , we don't have a defensive midfielder available right now .

Kai can backup Felix playing behind DDF. Maybe he‚Äôll learn something by watching Felix play. Mount would probably be 3rd choice now at that #10 position but really he and Kai can battle it out for the backup role. 

Hope Mudryk gets healthy quick. Definitely wasn‚Äôt himself tonight. Think as he and Enzo get more time together there‚Äôs going to be some lovely through balls played to Mudryk from deep. 

Madueke reminds me of Kurt Zouma a little with those long legs that sometimes get a little unruly.

We can be fair and say we overspent on nearly every player we bought, we undersold on nearly every player we sold. In terms of value for money, the past two transfer windows have been disasters. Just to give as an example: sterling, cucurella and fofana we bought for a combined 200 million. Is there anyone that would have thought this is a good way to spend 200 million before we spent it, let alone now in hindsight? On top of that, we let werner leave for nothing

I just don't understand why when we decide to spend a lot we do it by overpaying for players that aren't actually world class. The same goes for mudryk and enzo, sadly.

I understand havertz is good at runs, and hold up play and link up. But It doesn‚Äôt really mean shit if we can‚Äôt score.

The ease with which he was beating press after press was a sight for sore eyes. Him in a pivot with Zakaria or Kovacic would mean he'd have the licence at times to go forward and play those line breaking passes and hopefully linkup with Felix in the half spaces.,Chelsea,Yes,j75p29t,t1_j75o5hf
"I really feel like agreeing with you regarding your first para. I was also confused back then when we signed Havertz. Lamps had seen mount play under him for nearly 2 seasons. I always felt that Havertz and mount both are good in roughly same regions of the pitch and to some extent very similar players. I couldn't understand where we'd fit both of them at the same time on the pitch. 
Ideally you wouldn't want both of them at the same time on the pitch, but none of them actually deserves bench tbh.
Now signings do feel complementary to each other. Our recruitment definitely stepped up a notch this window.",Chelsea,Yes,j7623q5,t1_j760dgr

">  Is every managerial change accompanied by the team getting knocked out of all but 1 major competition

Why ignore the fact we were drawn away to Man City in both cup competitions? Not like we were getting tonked by lower league teams.


Also we aren't the first team to have a huge injury list, but equally we aren't the first team who has struggled with results because of a huge injury list. Dumb to handwave it away. 


We're still missing all our central midfielders other than Enzo (Zakaria, Kovacic, Kante), James made his comeback but is clearly taking is slow, Chilwell made a late comeback, Mudryk was unwell, Felix was suspended etc. Give it time you inpatient child.",Chelsea,Yes,j77h3ru,t1_j77cscx
"We've had very good squads with previous managerial stints. The squad has been flawed since hazard left as we have no one who could create in the final third. This killed Frank, TT was able to compensate by fixing the defensive errors, but even he couldn't fix our issues in the final third and towards the end of his time here you could see the defensive woes came back as we were conceding a lot more. I can't remember the last time the team has needed such a huge overhaul, maybe after the 2012 run? 

This is our biggest rebuild in recent history and the fact you say our current standing in the league and cup competitions isn't the shit that happens in a rebuild might indict you've never paid attention to a true rebuild. You don't have to go far and just look at arsenal over the past couple of years.

This is the sort of stuff that happens when we have poor transfers or maybe bring in players for a specific manager and then get rid of said manager a couple weeks later. Firing managers willy nilly was bound to catch up at some point",Chelsea,Yes,j77kmav,t1_j77cscx

"They're already making excuses for dropping future points because of it. Meanwhile we haven't had Kante since week 2, but hey that doesn't matter.",Chelsea,Yes,j77cnpd,t1_j77b5ka
They look absolutely burned out from years of Klopp's high-tempo style. I don't blame Klopp that much though. VVD hasn't been the same post-injury and losing Mane for free hurt them. They never replaced Gini properly and let their midfield age out in a similar way to CFC. They need some squad depth and have for a long time. Not sure if their ownership group will invest though.,Chelsea,Yes,j77qq1s,t1_j77krj8
"I love how Kai is always left out of criticisms even though he's just as unreliable.

"He's basically what we expected from Koulibaly, and he's 10 years younger!",Chelsea,Yes,j78ljoe,t1_j785cvp
"He does look really good. I also think our system helps our defense out a lot which is why we don't concede so many goals anymore (mostly thanks to Koulibaly finally being dropped for a professional footballer).

It feels to me like the groundwork for a successful side has been laid. Just need to put some away now, which may be asking too much out of Mount and Havertz",Chelsea,Yes,j788m4i,t1_j785cvp
">Who do we go after? Enzo-Rice would be good but expensive, I‚Äôm not exactly sold on Caicedo or Onana. Worth a thought, we have time until the summer.

I say Romeo Lavia should be our priority over Rice. Lavia most likely would be cheaper and seems more talented as well.

>What do we do with the striker situation? Havertz might come good but the Club must be running out of patience, I‚Äôm willing to give him time until the end of the season. If he leaves we will likely need 2 strikers if Broja doesn‚Äôt recovers. 

Havertz is as good as gone, no reason why we should keep him anymore.

>Who do we buy that isn‚Äôt just a target man but can get involved in buildup and be fluid with surrounding players? 

Benjamin Sesko, his only weakness atm is finishing which is still normal since he is only 19.

>Is Vlahovic good at that? His stats are poor but that could be due to Juve‚Äôs playsyle. I definitely don‚Äôt want to play Nkunku as a sole 9. What do we do?

He is decent but not exceptional with link up and hold up plays, not really his main strength.",Chelsea,Yes,j76gms2,t1_j76e5fh
">And who the fuck do we put on corner duty?

We can put gallagher on to hit the first man!!

&#x200B;

Also just go in for Palhinha, Palhinha Enzo midfield would be nice.",Chelsea,Yes,j76ifr6,t1_j76e5fh
"Exact same opinion. I also think Enzo is best in a double 6, preferably with Zak in a 4231 or with Kova/Kante in a 343. I think those options are enough, but if we're going for another midfield in the summer then I prefer we break the bank again for Jude by a mile, and then buy Zakharyan for 4231.

Corner should be for the wingbacks imo. And I also have 0 idea for Striker. There's just too few names atm. Also same thought with Kai although I REALLY want him to succeed here, but I don't trust Vlahovic tbh. If anything I'd try for Benz (unlikely/impossible even) until a new star comes up or Fofana/Broja breaks through.",Chelsea,Yes,j76hacq,t1_j76e5fh

"Klopp would never come here, but imagine Klopp with our spending power.",Chelsea,Yes,j77gytp,t1_j77f5yf
"Would be ironic given he's cried about all our signings.

But I'd personally drive Jurgen down from Scouseland to see him replace Potter.

That would be a tremendous upgrade, if he got sacked now I'd even be willing to promise him the job in the summer and let him take some time off to recharge.

Graham is a dead man walking, he may go today, tomorrow, the summer, next season but I think pretty much anyone who knows anything about the game knows he isn't going to be managing us the next time we win a major trophy.",Chelsea,Yes,j77fuf8,t1_j77f5yf
"He gets put on an island defensively every week for one. There is only so much he can do when he's defending in acres of space everytime the oppositions sends it wide left. 

Hes been poor going forward but hasn't had a dangerous player in front of him to work off of as well as getting no support defensively which makes him even more erratic in possesion. The team has struggled to retain possesion in the opponents half like under Sarri or Tuchel and the constant loss of possesion by the forwards leads to him getting targeted on the break more often than he should. 

I imagine he would look better with a back three where he has a extra centerback to help defend the half and wide spaces.",Chelsea,Yes,j760ka6,t1_j75tvdh
It's definitely our midfield issue,Chelsea,Yes,j75xpy8,t1_j75tvdh
No outlet in the midfield to consistently pass the ball to...because the midfield is awful,Chelsea,Yes,j75xwrj,t1_j75tvdh
"What gets on my nerves with him is his fucking diving in and getting beaten every time. He doesn't want to defend by the looks of it. And im going to be honest, From the 5 mins we saw of Chilly last night, he still looks injured.",Chelsea,Yes,j75xmzu,t1_j75tvdh
Before this January we simply didn't have direct players for counter attacks,Chelsea,Yes,j760s25,t1_j75wr1j

"What‚Äôs the point of buying Zakaria permanently? He can‚Äôt stay fit and that‚Äôs the last thing we need at CM, unfit players.

"Depends what we want to do with Santos as well/how highly they rate him. 


Could have a 4 of like Enzo/Zakaria/Santos/new signing

"Don't blame him for not squaring either, Havertz was behind him so would have been hard to spot and Leno was beaten. Just a bad finish at the end of a promising action.",Chelsea,Yes,j75xolr,t1_j75xfzp
"I think easing him into the team is the best way, I'm not sure yet if he's ready to be a starter at this level. The whole action was promising bar the finish, his touches to trap the ball then get past the defender were sublime and then he opened it up brilliantly by cutting back onto his left. 

Unfortunately, we can't seem to buy a goal at the moment so just our luck that finishing is again an issue with a new signing. Looks like the club are going to be giving him the backup striker minutes this season, and not Auba.",Chelsea,Yes,j75yfq8,t1_j75xfzp
I thought majority of Arsenal fans were ecstatic on what a steal Jorgi deal is.,Chelsea,Yes,j76tlsf,t1_j76szk3
"I‚Äôll have u know that Potter joined a team with a strong defensive pattern and a none existent offensive pattern, and though it took 600m and  the worst form we‚Äôve ever been, he transformed us into a club with no offensive pattern AND no defensive pattern.",Chelsea,Yes,j76hgkq,t1_j76e4qf
Nothing. Simple as that.,Chelsea,Yes,j76ennv,t1_j76e4qf

"But under Tuchel they were being told to pass backwards? Players have their own mind. No managwr is telling a player to pass backwards, and no manager is telling two 8s to play in the box like that. They are like schoolyard kids goal hanging. Kovacic and Zakaria would never play that high because they have discipline. Mudryk and Madueke when he can on had to drop deep to get the ball because the other two were in their positions constantly.",Chelsea,Yes,j76hf8i,t1_j76c37b

How about you shut the fuck up Plastic and stop pretending all these Champions league winners, former player of the seasons and highly regarded talents are good enough to for us to finish in the top half or score more than a goal every 2 games.

What's the point in sacking him right now? Who do you bring in? The earliest this conversation should be had is the summer.,Chelsea,Yes,j76l1l0,t1_j76kds3
"*We* have nothing to do with the process. Potter is here to stay.

This is how the ownership proceeds. They disrupted the entire club from top to bottom so they know this isn‚Äôt an easy job and they picked Potter from data analysis. They‚Äôre giving him time and certainly not judging on the chaos this season has been (some injury related, some the owners have themselves generated).

No one is going to fix this overnight. Even Tuchel struggled at the start of the season having to integrate new players on top of injuries and a botched preseason.

Now Potter is managing an enormous squad of 30+ players, unprecedentedly big in football. It‚Äôs an NFL roster in comparison to other clubs.

That means drilling a team is a LOT harder. It would be hard for any manager.

The players available change wildly game to game, new faces to integrate every new, injuries at key positions.

This is a ride your bumps phase. It‚Äôs a squad with 18 new players compared to last year, they literally don‚Äôt know each other. A lot of them are project players as well.

The requirement now is to get some of these new players up to PL speed so they can be week in, week out starters next season, and try and build a cohesive unit by the end of the season.

There will be no sacking anytime soon. The club has yet to refurbish its medical staff, performance department, and to trim the squad to a manageable size. Those things aren‚Äôt on the coach, they‚Äôre both complicit in the circumstances that led to this season.",Chelsea,Yes,j76mf1y,t1_j76kds3
"You're comparing the best results of Potters time at Brighton with the entirety of De Zerbi's time there.

Why not talk about the fact Potters Brighton were one of the lowest scoring teams in the league all 3 of his seasons there?

How he won 28% of his league games there across his tenure?

How he went on a double digit winless run every season?

Potter has came in and made us significantly worse literally not one person on the planet with more than 1 brain cell would dispute that.

The question is why do the Potter stans keep saying he needs years, another 600m, more players, less injuries despite still having a billion pounds worth of talent to pick from when pretty much every manager from De Zerbi to Dyche to Unai Emery to Lopetegui can come in and immediately stamp their identity on their new teams and improve results.",Chelsea,Yes,j77hrv4,t1_j77hkqu
"It's because it was trained for 2021 data, so at that time Tuchel was in charge and we didn't look dogshit, so it'd be a correct guess from then and we did finish third lol",Chelsea,Yes,j76bx1v,t1_j7661js

">All jokes about Declan Rice aside, he might be the best partner for Enzo we could bring in the summer. There are huge question marks about Zakaria‚Äôs injury record.

I would have gone for Zakaria in a second, but his fitness is a massive doubt. 

>We need a destroyer to sit next to Enzo. Who do ya‚Äôll think would make the perfect partner? 

This one of the couple of positions we need to strengthen in the summer. Kante isn't a DM, RLC could have been a cost-free option if he still had his legs. Kovacic will also needs a DM beside him for defensive cover. 

>Rice Caicedo Lavia Zubimendi Onana Bissouma , just naming different DMs.

Signing Rice would make the most sense as he is young, fit and affordable (I guess as he only have 1+1 years left on his contract). Also, he's been proven in the league.

Caicedo isn't a defensive midfielder per se. He's in between Essien and Kante.

Lavia is still inexperienced.

Zubimendi, don't know much about him.

Onana, the second best of the mentioned.

"He was good. Helped by Reece looking about 60% fit and not wanting to get re-injured, but fair play to Willian. I forgot what final third ball retention looked like",Chelsea,Yes,j769vm6,t1_j75y83z
"willian was always great when in form. his touches, shooting, and technique were all at a high level. the problem was there would be swaths of games where he would do the bare minimum with no progression or end product. and he would get picked every week because jose did not know how to rotate.

but it is interesting that a lot of players even the ones who are considered technical have more bad touches and more questionable shot placements. when i think of past players, the top players did not have that as often. I'm thinking its the pace of the game in the prem that's escalated that's causing this because even 5 years back the league was not as rapid. so there is less time altogether to think or do.",Chelsea,Yes,j769uxf,t1_j75y83z
"Chopping managers wasn't the problem,the problem was that we didn't have a sporting director or some sort of squad planner so that they could bring managers that complement the squad rather than the frankenstein we created by hiring managers with different playing styles and buying players for them and hiring another manager and buying players for them.",Chelsea,Yes,j76c8fl,t1_j75u4vm
"Chopping managers brought us multiple CLs, ELs & PL titles. Probably the most successful English club in that same timeframe!

">Out of all fanbases, Chelsea fanbase should know the best that chopping managers when things are rough is not how a rebuild is done. 

Eh? When we have ever done a rebuild? Everything about the previous regime was about short term thinking. Sure, we were able to win trophies here and there but we were never a consistent, dominant force despite all those success. All those constant sackings back then is a reason why you have people already calling for Potter's head right now.",Chelsea,Yes,j75vs7y,t1_j75u4vm

"Dyche is obviously a better manager than Potter.

His Burnley team had a higher win percentage, scored more goals, conceded less goals all while spending less than Potters Brighton

"It‚Äôs every bit as crazy to blindly support him after what we‚Äôve seen over the last few months as it is to want him gone, maybe more so. There are literally no indications that we made the right call. Tuchel came in and turned us into a better team instantly. Make any excuse you want about having a healthier squad, etc. The fact is that the signs were there from the start. Do you really get that same feeling from Potter?

I honestly have no idea what to do with Potter. I have no idea if he‚Äôs the right guy, because there‚Äôs just as much evidence that he IS the guy as there is that he ISN‚ÄôT the guy.",Chelsea,Yes,j75q7ks,t1_j75lmxn
"I want to copy and paste a comment I made 3 weeks ago that is just as relevant today. Can you answer all this? Can you tell me why we should be patient? Here:

Potter just isn't a great coach. He has zero accolades, he wasn't even that great at Brighton, his greatest accomplishment is doing well in the lower divisions of a third rate league no one outside their country actually watches. He has zero charisma and wouldn't know how to inspire a monkey to eat a banana. The biggest reason he got the job is because he's easy to work with for overbearing owners.

In terms of accomplishments (except maybe Lampard), Potter is the worst manager we've had since Abramovich first took over. ""Trust the process"" doesn't work when the manager is just terrible. Sticking a fry cook in a 5 star kitchen won't eventually turn the fry cook into a 5 star chef; it just turns the 5 star restaurant into a fast food establishment.

There is literally zero reason to believe Potter will suddenly become a top coach when he hasn't been his entire career. We're expecting a manager to reach a level he's never proven he can reach before, instead of just sticking it out with Tuchel and expecting him to return to a level with the squad that he had reached previously.

For those who keep defending Potter, just answer this: why? What factual, logical, rational reason is there to believe that he can be a coach worthy of winning the Premier League, Champion's League with Chelsea (Because that's the bar, by the way, just in case you guys forgot what kind of club we are. Reaching top 4 isn't the bar.) What has he done to make you believe this?

The answer is nothing, btw. There is no logical reason to believe it. It's just hype.

A manager isn't going to become an amazing manager just by giving him time. What makes you believe that? Destiny? He needs to have some proof that he can be amazing in the first place. Potter has none of that proof.

Edit: And I want to add -- I agree having 3 managers in one season is a disgrace. But if it were up to me, we would've only had 1. I would've been more than content with giving Tuchel time rather than giving Potter time, because Tuchel has proven that he can be an amazing manager, whereas Potter hasn't. But since we're stuck with this amateur, I'd rather replace him immediately than keep crossing my fingers for something that has never happened (Potter being an amazing manager) to finally happen. 3 managers and 1 mistake in one season is better than 2 managers and 2 mistakes.",Chelsea,Yes,j75lwyu,t1_j75lmxn

"Agreed. Understat even has the xG of the last four at 7.8. Either way, scoring 2 from an expected range of 6-8 is an insane underperformance that isn't sustainable. 

It's unfortunate that Potter's going through this rough patch of injuries, individual performances, and xG terrorism from our attackers, but it matches up pretty well with his stint at Brighton. xG underperformance will inevitably translate to solid overall performances with a bit of time.",Chelsea,Yes,j76a6dh,t1_j765c23

Potter will be gone after Dortmund do us.,Chelsea,Yes,j76dkrz,t1_j767p1e
"Look at the tough guy over there. Those truths are more personal opinions than anything, but do carry on if it makes you feel superior.

Yes, bitching and crying on Reddit is actually an indication of us winning things, it surely is not because we are managed by a clueless clown who had no idea of what he is doing at this level.",Chelsea,Yes,j76bgjt,t1_j767p1e
"1. You're right, Potter ain't going anywhere. The only way he does is if he agreed to a some sort of a 'performance clause' in his contract, but that has never been standard practice in football so I doubt it. Truth is that he's on a 5-year contract and if Chelsea sacks him, he'll be owed a mountain of money. 
2. Tuchel most certainly isn't coming back. His vision was too different from that of the ownership. There was no chance for it to work and no chance that he comes back. 
3. It's not about last night, it's about this season. We have been absolutely shit under Tuchel and then even more shit under Potter. If we're 'improving' because we're praying to football gods for Thiago Silva not to get injured so that we don't bleed goals, that's not improvement. Player attitude has been a problem at Stamford Bridge for years and there are no signs of that changing under Potter. 
4. I you want my opinion, for me it's not even about the results. It's about the complete absence of any idea of how to play. I couldn't tell you if we're trying to be a counterattacking team, or a possession/press team. No clue if we're trying to overload the sides or pass through the middle. It's like the whole idea is 'all right lads, let's have fun out there'. 
5. The injuries are a fair argument, but we're not playing 16 year olds from the academy. We were playing Mount and Sterling and Jorginho and Kovacic and we were looking like absolute f\*\*\*\*\*g bums. 
6. If you say that it's because the players are new, well that's a fair argument too. Then again, I could tell you that Mount-Havertz-Zyiech have been playing together for what? two years? and there is no progress there at all. 
7. You might criticise people who vent here all you want, but 'trust the process' isn't really a great mentality. Oh, and the team that invented 'trust the process' never won anything.

"We've been playing much better in general ever since the FA cup loss to City. Not a coincedence that's when Sterling and Pulisic left the side and Felix, Mudryk etc started coming in.",Chelsea,Yes,j78fkle,t1_j78ewxt
More people will start to realise soon enough,Chelsea,Yes,j76ingu,t1_j76f0z0
So is mount Gallagher and havertz,Chelsea,Yes,j76fpp5,t1_j76f0z0
Facts. You don't just blindly trust a process. You have to see something that makes you believe in it,Chelsea,Yes,j767mgp,t1_j76462q
"Wtf is this non nuanced take, just because that team won a CL while overcoming odds does not make it a good squad. Rudiger is gone, midfield and both wingbacks being some of the most important part of how they found success are still out with injuries. 

If you take rashford alone out of that United team, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to win a single game even vs Bournemouth.",Chelsea,Yes,j76fpwa,t1_j76462q
"Exactly. We are solid defensively now and Reece is just coming back. Not to mention Chilwell too. Regarding our midfield , we have to cope with the injuries this season. Enzo Kante and Zakaria are crucial. Kova is in piss poor form. We'll manage when Kante and Zakaria get back. Regarding our forwards , we got a lot of talented players. It will definitely take atleast 3-4 games for them to get settled and gel on the pitch. Our rebuild is nearly done. Just need to apply finishing touches in the summer by getting a DM/ST and a GK. We'll be back.",Chelsea,Yes,j75rebl,t1_j75quv9
Did he spend 250 mil in the summer? Did he set up the squad this bad druing pre season? You can clearly see this squad has been formed under 5-6 managers and sacking Potter would improve absolutely nothing,Chelsea,Yes,j75uwzi,t1_j75tgs9
"> Hell, I get sacked in football manager managing Chelsea when I finished 6th and people here claimed we need to give a full season to Potter after this horrific season

What do your FM moments have to do anything with real life and football?",Chelsea,Yes,j75x65q,t1_j75tgs9
"There is no point in sacking Potter , that's not how a project works mate. Get off football manager. Sacking a manager in the midst of a rebuild is exactly why a rebuild is needed in the first place. We'll be back to square one and then you'll say the same thing about the next manager and the manager after that.",Chelsea,Yes,j75tw9w,t1_j75tgs9
"Give him some time. He has always had a slow start. There are a few problems to fix, but direction is alright. As long as improvements are there, it should be ok. And there are improvements, but we need to see if we can sustain that. Being trigger happy is entitlement, and it needn't work. If potter didn't improve next year, maybe we should look at it. Right now it's too early, too hasty and probably too expensive",Chelsea,Yes,j75vfsl,t1_j75tgs9
"Oh man, block capitals, this kid is serious",Chelsea,Yes,j7687lb,t1_j763564
For whom bro?,Chelsea,Yes,j764fpz,t1_j763564
Cuz they‚Äôre the only ones consistently healthy these days,Chelsea,Yes,j76kxqi,t1_j76k9hz
"Mild disagree. Kai's finishing needs work, but I also think even Kai would score those chances normally.

Also, I think it's a bit irrelevant comparing his chances to our other strikers. Sure, they have better finishing and would probably score in those exact situations, but I'm certain neither Auba nor Lukaku would even get in those positions at all.",Chelsea,Yes,j75pwh6,t1_j75oo2u
We have already bought one from RB Leipzig,Chelsea,Yes,j75p1ax,t1_j75oo2u
Amazing what a competent manager can do,Chelsea,Yes,j76xjhm,t1_j76w71f
I still can't believe that wolves and villa hired better managers than us,Chelsea,Yes,j776txz,t1_j76w71f
He underperformed with msn,Chelsea,Yes,j75u5aq,t1_j75kxbr
"No thanks. Failed at every job he took except Barca which had the greatest trio in football history. Failed at Celta , Failed at Roma and failed with Spain. If winning trophies with Barca is enough for you , maybe we should hire Valverde who nearly went invincible with Barca",Chelsea,Yes,j75lbwr,t1_j75kxbr
i had enough. Just give me his address..I will drag him to manage us,Chelsea,Yes,j75lh25,t1_j75kxbr
"Then you stay with Tuchel, continue with someone the players didn't like, risk the league position being worse than it is now, and then have Enrique take over for Boxing Day with the team less use to his style and tactics (which inevitably take time to get use to) and then it would be Enrique isn't the guy because the same problems that existed under Tuchel and exist presently under Potter, would still exist with Enrique. Having a squad that's unmotivated, out of form for a year and some of them still wanting to leave and you get a disastrous season no matter who the manager is. The summer needs to be about getting players out and further improvements in. Potter needs a full preseason with the team. His team. I can't imagine we'll still be this bad next season. But if we are, then it's clear what needs to happen. Next season is about progress like United have shown this season. All of this talk about Potter is reminiscent of his first season at Brighton when their fans didn't think he was any better than Chris Houghton. Over time he proved them wrong and they were gutted to lose him.

Also, it's been several months now, I would have thought people would understand Tuchel wasn't purely sacked for results.",Chelsea,Yes,j75mz6h,t1_j75kxbr
Yesterday shows anything but he needing time. He's our of his depth and that's evident for long. A 1-0 against palace won't hide shit,Chelsea,Yes,j76cucg,t1_j76cnr5
What have you seen so far from Potter that makes think he is the right man?,Chelsea,Yes,j76et4v,t1_j76cnr5
Yesterday shows what?,Chelsea,Yes,j76hiue,t1_j76cnr5
Datro got that drog in him,Chelsea,Yes,j75o0cw,t1_j75ltmc
"Honestly think we should play him instead of havertz, nothing against havertz even though i have a couple things that he did wrong, but ddf might be a better option as a striker and not worrying about anything else besides goals",Chelsea,Yes,j75nm0u,t1_j75ltmc
"Relax. It probably happened over a few hours. I‚Äôm sure it would have been awkward to tell players while the move is being negotiated, imagine it collapsed during negotiations.",Chelsea,Yes,j786x8y,t1_j77zgnm
"No. Like Mount, some people have it in for him win, lose or draw. Was he amazing? No. Was he shit? No. He was fine. He can‚Äôt take a fucking corner. The main gripe for me was how far apart the 3 midfielders are/were. It left Enzo isolated. With Gallagher, I feel like he‚Äôs often still trying to impress by running about like a mad man. But he contributed to some nice link up play a couple of times and broke up the play well. He was ok for me. Like most of the team. Same as James, Cucu, Mudryk, Mount, Havertz. Just‚Ä¶ fine.",Chelsea,Yes,j75p1ub,t1_j75oh34
"Yes, he was even messing up simple passes,baffled as to why he played the full 90",Chelsea,Yes,j75p3qa,t1_j75oh34
Headless chicken performance by him and mount,Chelsea,Yes,j75x6vs,t1_j75oh34
"In terms of cardio? Great workout.

Footballing performance? Atrocious",Chelsea,Yes,j760p53,t1_j75oh34
"Reasses next season, maybe around midway through.",Chelsea,Yes,j76019w,t1_j75x8lo
"Deffo would give him the entire next season or even two. We need to break the cycle of changing managers so often. Ancelloti , Conte and Tuchel are the managers that I wish had stayed and they are known to be good managers still. 

I never liked this about Chelsea, we hit a sticky patch and just change coaches, might work but it's not sustainable. We need one identity of playing and that's only attainable through longevity. 

Lastly, Arteta is a great example.",Chelsea,Yes,j75zcjl,t1_j75x8lo
He shouldn't be assessed on what he does for the rest of this season? If this poor form is how the season ends we should sack him before the start of the next season.,Chelsea,Yes,j763zlf,t1_j75x8lo
"I think he‚Äôll get the next 2 seasons tbh, we‚Äôve pretty much got a whole new team bar the few that will probably be sold in the summer anyway. They need time to gel and understand what Potter wants.",Chelsea,Yes,j7626k9,t1_j75x8lo
"I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so hard to be ok with Potter out, potter In or somewhere in the middle. I‚Äôd be surprised if a wait and see type of poster is saying Potter is great or perfect. Why do we allow such a difference of opinion to drive the name calling and hate in our fans? It‚Äôs utter chaos. Usually everyone is being fairly critical but the Potter Out crowd tends to only see other fans as clueless dumbasses and then the Potter In crowd replies with name calling.",Chelsea,Yes,j76s37h,t1_j76qr6d
"Fulham plays great fotball,

For me playing as defensivly solid as we did was impressive.

Badiashile had 1 defensive misstake but - what a defender to compliment silva.

Silva wad world class as usual.

Honestly considered how little he was tested james was cooked alot! Cucu actually not as much, especially since they overloaded there the whole game",Chelsea,Yes,j75n65b,t1_j75lml0
Quite obvious you lot only look at score lines. They were playing against 10 men since the 17th minute.,Chelsea,Yes,j776pv1,t1_j776dr8
None. Thiago Silva will be welcoming new tenants into his pockets,Chelsea,Yes,j779132,t1_j776dr8

"If we win the EL, basically like reaching the Rd of 16 in CL financially

More important though  winning EL gives you almost same European coffecient as winning CL does lol

Making Top 6 is a must in my opinion, and Boehly knows this",Chelsea,Yes,j77bexk,t1_j77b4p4
"Better off not going near that place after a bad result because no matter how objective you are or how much the facts back up whatever you say, you will just be buried in mindless trolling.",Chelsea,Yes,j75r4s6,t1_j75mk62
Ziyech slows us down too much as he needs to shift to his left foot. And it's not his fault but we don't have a proper target for his crosses,Chelsea,Yes,j75o06b,t1_j75nb62
"You really want Chalobah getting pressed on the ball in midfield and being responsible for taking the ball off the defenders to build attacks? Have you seen Chalobah on the ball?


One of my pet peeves is people thinking defenders can just waltz into central midfield.",Chelsea,Yes,j76e84p,t1_j76dk3r
"I don't know, but there are 2 options - no you can't, or yes you can until the end of this season. If it's a seasonal membership it's likely that you're all good.",Chelsea,Yes,j78ddyg,t1_j782iy2
"Gallagher was actually better than Mount yesterday, still doesn't mean he was good though.",Chelsea,Yes,j76ec6r,t1_j763mp0
He was left out to dry by Mason. Look at his average position Mount was an 8 higher up the pitch than Mudryk was,Chelsea,Yes,j76hv1c,t1_j76aca6
We are shit ourselves,Chelsea,Yes,j778veq,t1_j776ncu
"And yet somehow, City and Arsenal sit 1st and 2nd while Everton, Wolves and United sit 18th, 15th an 3rd.",Chelsea,Yes,j770n32,t1_j76w3bu
"It's worse for us. At least Liverpool and Arsenal were justified in sacking their managers and bringing in someone to ""trust the process"". They didn't throw away someone that brought them huge success after hitting a bad patch like we did.",Chelsea,Yes,j76whjy,t1_j76w3bu
"So you should expect immediate results and if you do not get them it should lead to a reactionary firing, while simultaneously expecting long-term success with no drop-off? 

Arsenal are in 1st and you are choosing to look at a single game in the most competitive and parity-driven league as your sample size. Liverpool has been a better club than CFC for the last 5 years and was fighting for the quadruple last season, but we should look at only recent results and not failed transfers, injuries, or other issues, just solely managerial blame. 

Yet, at the exact same time, you wanted to keep TT, who, much like Klopp this year, had a successful run only to fall into the midtable. By your own argument, why should TT have been given time, since apparently, any falloff means that a change should occur because the process is no longer viable? ETH is having a great run, but if he falters or loses to a bottom-table team is he automatically out? The shifting goalposts and nitpicking of sample sizes essentially mean that no manager is safe unless perfection is achieved both immediately and long-term.",Chelsea,Yes,j77pipf,t1_j76w3bu
We have enough players to compete. We might not have a complete squad to win the league but we have a very competitive side. We can keep wanting more and more players but it's clear that the manager is underperforming,Chelsea,Yes,j75r15i,t1_j75pjwe
"Kante and Zakaria, if any going then yes if not we just less lucky than should be. If team would be assembled we could make few games with temporary replacement, but now when everyone is shite it's just too much. Bottom line is Zakaria and Kante is enough with back up from Enzo",Chelsea,Yes,j75rl1d,t1_j75pjwe
"Yeah, CEO and Manager. Those are my two positions I dream we got a good signing for",Chelsea,Yes,j75rrmm,t1_j75pjwe
You people are ridiculous,Chelsea,Yes,j75rqvc,t1_j75pjwe
We don't need a striker.,Chelsea,Yes,j760mm8,t1_j75pjwe
"If Klopp left Liverpool and said yes, I want to coach Chelsea next, then you‚Äôd be mental to stick with Potter. Even if our form turns around and we win every game from here on until the end of the season, I‚Äôd still boot him in a heartbeat to replace him with Klopp.

Klopp would never come here, but he‚Äôs an all-time great manager. Potter has done nothing at the top level yet. It‚Äôs not even a question. You go with Klopp ten times out of ten.",Chelsea,Yes,j78ogvf,t1_j78npaf
"One season is fine to implement his non-existent style. The multiple seasons bollocks was really just multiple transfer windows, not the case with potter, ideally only 2/3 players remain for a  complete squad for Potter. He has the rest of the season to do better than 10th, after that it will be Backing the manager Ole Style.",Chelsea,Yes,j7a3cx5,t1_j78npaf
No. At least Havertz gets involved if we don‚Äôt create chances. Auba is done.,Chelsea,Yes,j760hnb,t1_j75z6ba
"Auba didn't seem to be interested in playing, every minute he played for us. Hopefully dofana plays instead of havertz. And zakaria kova instead of mount Gallagher",Chelsea,Yes,j760rn9,t1_j75z6ba
Ziyech and Auboomerang shouldn't play again.,Chelsea,Yes,j75zv92,t1_j75z6ba
Isn‚Äôt zakaria out for the next one too?,Chelsea,Yes,j76199x,t1_j75z6ba
"Looks to nice to manage such a ruthless club like Chelsea, guess we will have to wait and see

Think his maximum level is to manage club like Spurs",Chelsea,Yes,j77yyz4,t1_j77wnc9
"It's a good point lol. Ancelotti is a good example of a quiet guy at least inspiring in another way. Potter uses his emotional intelligence degrees to go about it another way, that approach has its benefits and disadvantages. I think the disadvantage comes when we're struggling, need more of a ruthless, inspiring leader in those times. Like if Simeone is here right now, he will find us a way to win, but maybe not the best football to watch long-term.",Chelsea,Yes,j780cjb,t1_j77wnc9
Just doesn't have the character of a chelsea manager.,Chelsea,Yes,j785ovx,t1_j77wnc9
"Doesn't seem beta to me, just calm",Chelsea,Yes,j789osz,t1_j77wnc9

Del Bosque?,Chelsea,Yes,j77xk5b,t1_j77wnc9
My problem is its like he wants us to be playing fluid football with instantly over complicated formations changes when he should be doing the fucking basics first before complicating things. How is complicating it going to work out when the squad has been in constant change through injuries and signings when so many of them miss training or are only starting out. We're trying to run before we can walk.,Chelsea,Yes,j75xchp,t1_j75uszg
"He is dropping players left and right..

Great at defending both in our own box and om the front line (90+ %)
Good at short to medium passes
Good at progressing with the ball
Good to great in headed duels
When he shots to get it on target

He is bad at:
Getting shots of (his shot numbers are bad for a ambitious team) 
Getting the ball past the keeper

Surprisingly enough he is more or less equal to his expected goals this year, which means that neither him nor the team get him into good shooting positions



So short story, our forward doesnt get the ball in dangerous areas.

Either he spends his time in the wrong part of the field or our team cant get the ball into him in good positions",Chelsea,Yes,j75ntfa,t1_j75kp9q

No offense but the fans are complaining as we should see progress. Nobody is expecting much from the league but we should be seeing a style of play that Potter wants and we're over half way through the seasons and it still looks clueless.

"With Potter, no way",Chelsea,Yes,j76cqah,t1_j75rd7m
"Trying to position in between the line while occupying the half-spaces. That as a means of creating numerical advantage (2v1) against the fullbacks. Arsenal and City do this regularly. The issue with this setup is that both players (Mount and Gallagher) are not yet tactically adept at knowing how high and wide they should be. 

Here as usual, Fulham pressed in a 424. Cucurella should have inverted into the midfield (of course he's no Zinchenko) to compensate for the Fulham press. At the same time Ziyech making the wide run for the switch from BB as the defender is in a 2v1 disadvantage. OR Gallagher should have moved deeper, about 4 yards deeper (of course the defender won't follow him when he knows Ziyech is lurking behind. 

Tbh, Mount and Gallagher are too high. One wrong pass from any of the back 5 and we have the opponent overrun us.

A reason we struggled was Fulham tried to forced us to play wide where we had no pace and trickery (James just recovering; Cucurella isn't the best FB bombing forward; Mudryk on a cold; Ziyech always being Ziyech). We got better after the subs though.",Chelsea,Yes,j79g5y1,t1_j798w6t

"Lets wait and see how he actually plays for us before worrying about it to be fair. He'll be on huge wages which goes against what we've done this January with our other signings, so he needs to show he's a true star for this team to warrant it. 


Hard to know how much Atletico would ask for him to be honest, and what wages he'd be willing to take, especially as we'd only be able to amortise the transfer fee over 5 years.",Chelsea,Yes,j77nbgn,t1_j77mjj1
"Extremely high. He wants to be here and we have several players we will be selling. Even if we don‚Äôt get maximum on any, there will be plenty that catch a good fee. Felix will be Blue as long as he plays well the rest of this season.",Chelsea,Yes,j77n70m,t1_j77mjj1
"Why would he sign for us? Without cl football, it will be hard.",Chelsea,Yes,j78p5gw,t1_j77mjj1
"We don't even need him going forward, he can orchestrate from deep perfectly fine and his natural positioning when we're dominating possession should be pretty high up anyway as he should be in position to counterpress quickly. Think of Rodri for City - it feels like you see him pick the decisive pass just before the assist for half their goals. That's what Enzo is perfect for. 

What you really want is someone like Kovacic next to him who will take some of the pressure off him in our buildup and not leave him so isolated. Kovacic is also a lot better at driving forward with it, and is very good at playing through pressure together with another pivot midfielder, so there's a lot of different ways he and Enzo could progress play. Enzo would get slightly more time on the ball (so more chances to pick out switches or key passes through the lines), but he'd also be good at playing Kovacic into positions to drive forward (like Kova and Jorginho did so well).

That's the way forward for me.",Chelsea,Yes,j75r98w,t1_j75p29t

"Our system doesn't though... Last game for example you had a back four with the two wide mids pushed up near the strikers to create numerical advantage leaving Enzo all alone.

Hardly helping him.",Chelsea,Yes,j7a3zu0,t1_j788m4i
"Definitely agree with the take that Lavia should be the dm to be looking at. That does all hinge on his injury record though. 

As for the striker option, Vitinha would've been a decent shout, much more clinical than Sesko with good dribbling and flair. He's recently gone to OM (for a decent price as well 30m euros plus add-ons), so his price would have jacked up unfortunately.",Chelsea,Yes,j76hka9,t1_j76gms2
"I rate Bellingham but Enzo-Bellingham pivot feels a bit defensively unbalanced, not to mention that it would be extremely expensive and that we'd still need a DM.

"Well you're also ignoring a huge factor and conveniently so. 

Simply look at the players Potter had and De Zerbi had. Look at the way those players were coached before Potter and the way they were coached before De Zerbi.

The difference is night and day. Brighton's board seems to be one of the smartest in recent years. Yet they never sacked Potter even when they were close to the relegation zone. That's not because of pity. 

>Potter has came in and made us significantly worse literally not one person on the planet with more than 1 brain cell would dispute that.

I have more than a single brain cell and I will dispute that. Results are not always directly correlated to perfomances. Take our last 4 prem games for example, Yes, poor results but underlying stats suggest several positives, especially in terms of chance creation. 


Dyche has managed 1 game, Emery and Lopetegui have currently shown 0 signs of long term growth(perhaps this is only a new manager bounce),  De Zerbi already Had a squad who was flying( Potter left them 4th). Stop overreacting.",Chelsea,Yes,j77k9f5,t1_j77hrv4
"I'm comparing his last 10 games, which are spread out across the end of last season and start of this one, which I think are what are most relevant as it's the closest squad and team to the one De Zerbi is utilizing. I'm not really interested in comparing Potter's results during the span of a lengthy and protracted building project- it seems valid to compare his and de zerbi's results once the product was closer to finished.

And yes, so far we have a smaller sample size for De Zerbi but all the reports on his play style was that it's high-attacking football that has a clear downside of bleeding goals. The numbers so far back that up.",Chelsea,Yes,j77iccs,t1_j77hrv4

Even if he is a weaker manager to stamp his authority I do feel he will organise and drill them over time. 

Some form of positive pragmatic system that allows expression and directness similar to Brighton, and the player‚Äôs individual skill will eventually get it done. I think him imparting his system is taking longer partly as he‚Äôs a less experienced and influential manager, from the injury crises and the regular interruptions.

I think over time he will sort it out, but at a cost to us qualifying for the champions league unfortunately.

">The only reason Potter got hired is because this mythical great style of play the media kept pretending he had which for some reason has never resulted in any of his previous teams actually managing to consistently score goals 

To be fair, Potter's Brighton teams were pretty much the definition of shit finishing in front of goal, they consistently underperformed on their xG metrics by [an](https://understat.com/league/EPL/2020) i[ncredible](https://understat.com/league/EPL/2021) amount.

"Those 'blind players' were Silva, Badiashile, and James, and I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure they have better decision making than anyone here mate.

Enzo offered options by dropping deeper, meaning he still need to find a way to deliver the ball above an empty midfield by himself. While the 3 I mentioned usually opted a direct pass to Cucu or Ziyech. I guess the idea is to get the ball quickly to the wings and keep the other 2 midfield up top (because they evidently can't drive the ball well enough before getting closed).

Not every passing lane should be entertained.",Chelsea,Yes,j75nndy,t1_j75lvi4

When are we allowed to question the single factor that every player of our squad has in common (hint, it‚Äòs the manager who avareges .9 points per PL match!).

What is this project we are supposed to trust in? What is Potters idea for the team? What does he need to show at least some glimpses of promising football? To produce at least some results against the weaker opponents we are playing? 

Let‚Äòs be real here. In the last months our transfer business has been absolutely mad. I‚Äòm not complaining! But you have to be objective enough to see that it is absolutely crazy how we have spent money. Now if this produces results I‚Äòm all for it. It is Chelsea after all. It‚Äòs the club I love.

"For Liverpool I don't think they really did bring someone in to *trust the process*, they just hired a manager who steadily took them forward so they chose to make him a project manager after the fact. This is how it always should be, bring in a manager with no expectations of making them long term, see how well the club and the manager work together and then either stick with him through thick and thin or move on before too much damage is done. 


It's a real shame that they couldn't just put their egos aside and hire people to work between them and the manager (or just not fall out with the entire old board and putting Cech in a position where he chose to leave that role) if they didn't get along with him on a personal level. 


Though, given everything we've seen and heard and the recent reports that our board supposedly almost ended up getting into a physical altercation with the Benfica board whilst negotiating, I think it's fair to say that only the most mild mannered yes man is going to work for them unless they fully extract themselves from any part of the football side of the club (note that Eghbali explicitly stated during the bidding process that he would play no part whatsoever in running the football club and that Clearlake was purely there to invest money and make money later on)",Chelsea,Yes,j76ydov,t1_j76whjy

"Yeah, I mean before the WC I hadn't really watched him in full games so I assumed he was a no8 type player like Bellingham, considering they were compared to each other a fair bit. But he looked like a natural at the base of midfield, and the type of player you've been banging on about us needing (not necessarily some defensive presence). Feel like we could easily use a midfield 3 like yesterday, with him at the base with two 8s. And personally, I really want to see Ruben given a chance as one of those 8s, I think Enzo would really enable him to do his thing. 

While I agree on him and Kova being an ideal duo when we're dominating possession, provided as another user mentioned they can work together, I do still wonder if he'll be even better if we can stick a holding defensive presence next to him. Kova can barely be relied on to play 10 games without getting injured anyway, so we will need Enzo to take up the progression burden most of the time and he seems to have showed that he can play that role well. He's not much of a dribbler but we've long cried out for a DM and a midfielder who can actually play threatening passes into the final third and it feels like we've finally landed someone who can do both.",Chelsea,Yes,j769plw,t1_j75r98w

Not to mention Jude is no slouch defensively either, he can provide stability when Dortmund played 4231. My idea is because both can play 6/8, they can cooperate and alternate with each other.

And I did factor Andrey and even Casedei when I said that. I always believe we need 22 good players for the starting 11, so 4 good players for 2 spots. Not to mention it can help us play 433 too.

You do know why Conte hates rotation, do you? He can drill 14 players like no other; but he hates bigger squads because it‚Äôs a lot harder to do it.
Pep regularly sells players without replacements as he too prefers a smaller squad to drill team exercises.

It‚Äôs common football knowledge.

I‚Äôm pretty sure the sporting infrastructure knows this. But the multiclub model is yet to take place so for now, you gotta have this enormous squad. 

No Europe next season will force them to trim the squad and that will be beneficial to the coach on top of playing less games (Chelsea and Liverpool have played the most football in Europe the past 2 years, both impossibly injured and exhausted), there‚Äôs the huge advantage of having full weeks to train.

The teams who‚Äôve done best this season? Arsenal and Newcastle, the two teams with a set starting XI (most stables XIs in the league) and less games played in the top half of the league.",Chelsea,Yes,j76qpp6,t1_j76pfbr
Your opinion is not that of the ownership who handpicked a coach based on data and analytics. You can yell at the wall as much as you want. They have a plan and they‚Äôre sticking to it.,Chelsea,Yes,j76r7ms,t1_j76r0e1
"It‚Äôs easier to drill any small squad. 
That‚Äôs why no other club has a squad with the size of ours. 
It makes training sessions ridiculously impossible.

Yes, Potter has been there since September where he‚Äôs had the most injuries in Europe. A not so shocking fact since Chelsea had previously played the most games in all of Europe the past 2 seasons (the other being Liverpool who are struggling just as much with a world class manager). He‚Äôs had a full week to train the team exactly once in that time.

Now he has a million signings and still injury issues.

These aren‚Äôt excuses, these are circumstances the club also voluntarily created: a squad overhaul on steroids, new faces, very young players, a gigantic squad with 4 first team GK to 10 attacking players and so on. 

So they know they‚Äôre also responsible for this season. The medical staff was fired in season and yet to be replaced. They cleaned house but haven‚Äôt filled a lot of positions.

What happens off the pitch always translates on the pitch.

They‚Äôre not sacking him anytime soon. You can complain and mock the process or give ultimatums. This is the Dodgers playbook. They disrupted their roster radically, and were losing as a result in the short term, they didn‚Äôt sack the manager because they know what an impossible task it is to have so many new players all at once and manage them. They also picked Potter based on data and analytics, they aren‚Äôt going to be reactive.

Their job is only starting. They have to fill medical department, performance and data, more coaching support, and trim the squad in the next few months. They are prepared for the chaos, disruption is quite literally their MO.",Chelsea,Yes,j76pu7q,t1_j76orcb

"Do you really think that Mount and Gallagher were so far ahead because Potter told them so? You think Potter isolated Enzo and bloated the forward line on purpose? That‚Äôs just wrong lol, Gallagher always does this and so does Mount, they have low football iq and poor interpretation of space. I do think this will improve though, it was Enzo‚Äôs first match.

I don‚Äôt have problems with him starting Mudryk, Mudryk wasn‚Äôt an issue. You do need to understand why Ziyech started though, the club wronged him and Potter has to show him that he‚Äôs still a part of the squad. This is how you prevent issues in the dressing room. 

What did Potter do well since he came in? Prioritises attacking football, figured out that 3atb isn‚Äôt working, we‚Äôre much more efficient in playing through press with our keeper and our backline, we‚Äôre much more direct than under Tuchel, more vertical passes, more noticeable attacking patterns. He cut off the players he doesn‚Äôt want, his defence is well organised, he gives equal chances to young players‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs not faultless, but blaming him for things no one could improve is just stupid.

"> the man had to start the likes of Aaron Connolly, Danny Welbeck and Neal Maupay for his entire tenure there because he simply had no other choice.

The man chose to buy Maupay for ¬£20m.

You can't absolve him for the blame of every attacking player he's ever coached being unable to finish at every club he's been at over a long period of time.

W see finishing as an individual thing but when every player Potter has coached in his career significantly underperforms their XG (The same players at Brighton are no longer underperforming theirs now) I really do think we have to ask what sort of finishing drills are part of Potters methods and how he speaks about players in the final third.

"Adapting isn't how you set up for consistent success. 

Pep doesn't adapt, he forces the team to adapt to him and its a big part of why he's the most consistently succesful manager in the world.

"So that's your answer? He has proven ""that he can build a squad and play exciting and attacking football and over achieve with minimum resources and losing his best players every year with Brighton.""

So let's break that down, yeah?

""He's proven that he can build a squad"" -- Brighton is still doing great without him. Was it him or was it their management that built the squad? 

'He's proven that he can play exciting and attacking football"" -- Potter has been extremely overrated from his Brighton days. He had plenty of no-win streaks; Google it. Look at their table finishes -- he joined in 2019, and during his tenure with them, they finished 15th, 16th, and 9th. Only last season he squeezed into the top half of the table.

15th and 16th. That's closer to relegation than midtable. Do you actually know what you're talking about?

""Over achieve with minimum resources and losing his best players every year"" -- Who the fuck cares, that's not his situation at Chelsea. At Chelsea he has near infinite resources and he keeps his best players every year. And how exactly did he overachieve? Instead of finishing 17th, they finish 15th? Great over achieving.

Again let me say it: there is no logical reason to expect Potter to suddenly become an amazing manager. You are high on hype and hope and you don't see it. This is not the right guy to ""trust the process"" with.",Chelsea,Yes,j75n3yp,t1_j75mjar

"Okay, I see. Please point out one thing you've seen on the pitch since he came that signals a forward thinking top class manager.

Here's what I mean. When De Zerbi replaced Potter, Brighton transitioned to this 4-2-2-2 shape with no real 9s and basically everyone acting as a creative outlet. From the second half of the 2021-22 season Arteta switched from forcing Guardiola-ball on his players to the current situational 10s, inverted full-backs system that relies on verticality and positional coaching.

Both of these were done in less than 6 months, and in Arteta's case, it became obvious that he only needs the players to plug a few gaps (and not an entire new 11). One Jesus and Zinchenko later, and it is finished. So yes, point out an evolution on Potter's part.",Chelsea,Yes,j76gz0o,t1_j76faqd

I was always willing to give him two seasons to prove his worth, but the reason you give manager that length of time say, is because you give them time for a rebuild, give him time for the players he wants for his style. But we've done an overhaul in two windows, minus a striker and another midfielder. Potter has less time to really prove his worth and I think that's completely understandable. 

The new players look better straight away, and James and Chilwell are back minus match fitness though which should improve soon. It's not all doom and gloom. If things still aren't clicking and at least seeing us score goals whatever the results, then I'll be getting worried. Potter will still be in charge come next season though, it won't change.

"It‚Äôs true. The pair is our most progressive, with probably just about enough defending, but Kova is significantly worse on the right. Changes his whole dribbling game and press evasion, which is by far his most valuable skill. It‚Äôd have to be Enzo there. So far he‚Äôs been a LCM with a little CDM in a 2 and 3. Definitely would take adjusting. With how disjointed and uncoordinated we look, it‚Äôd be nice to just have players in their best, most natural roles without overcomplicating it.

Our counter-pressing is so spread out and ineffective as well, so we probably need the pure defending and legs in midfield next to Enzo. Individual defensive ability of a Kante/Zakaria to make up for system failure. With a coordinated press and defensive shape I think Kova-Enzo would be enough for a good chunk of games behind Felix and other hard working forwards. In the shorter term we‚Äôd prob be better off with Enzo/Kova - Kante/Zak. 

Depends on fitness of course. So many variables with this squad right now lol",Chelsea,Yes,j767d85,t1_j75u1tk
">While I agree on him and Kova being an ideal duo when we're dominating possession, provided as another user mentioned they can work together, I do still wonder if he'll be even better if we can stick a holding defensive presence next to him.

I think that's not a bad idea in games that we expect to be contested in midfield. I don't hate a Kant√© or Caicedo type of player in games like that - a high volume ball-winner who doesn't play the deepest midfield role in our buildup (still allowing Enzo to dictate play and help us play out), but relieves defensive pressure on Enzo when there's a lot to do, lays the ball off to Enzo for him to hit transitions quickly. That's something we've been missing for a while and I'm sure it was part of the thinking behind Enzo, Mudryk, Madueke. 

Good thing is that doesn't need to be someone super expensive. It doesn't have to be 100m on Rice or Caicedo, because we're fine lining up with Enzo and Kovacic in games we dominate anyway. We can look at Lavia if Southampton go down or dig up some other talent for the role, or we can activate the clause for Zakaria.

"What struck me most about him was his game intelligence and reading of his surroundings. He honestly looked like someone who came out of Cobham and knew our players for years. 

I think a DM will allow Enzo more freedom to do both sides of the game according to the game situation and opponent. But the profile of that DM is tough to ascertain, I suppose a Kova is ideal because he can't both stay deep and protect and his dribbling offers a great variety to Enzo's passing range.

"1, they've won nothing, the only time that your league position matter is when the league finishes. 


2, in 3 years all they've won is an FA cup thanks to buying out the ref



There is absolutely nothing to show that ""trusting the process"" will bring you more success than just bringing in a competent manager. In fact, history shows the exact opposite. 



The choice is not ""trust the process"" and ""[be at the] top of the table"" or don't trust is and not be at the top of the table


It's bring in a good manager and be at the top of the table this season or bring in a bad manager and **hope** that in three years we've progressed as much as Arsenal, instead of regressed as much as a team like United did under OGS or Liverpool under Rodgers. Whereas, if you bring in a good manager and they don't work out, you lose one year and then you get a new top manager instead.


It's not rocket science to work out which way of doing things is best and most reliable. If once you've found the manager that brings you to the top and proves themselves, you then want to back them through thick and thin, that's absolutely fine because he's already proven himself. Doing that with someone who is actively making you worse is at very best a gamble.

It's not a rise at all.

Looks a pretty clear gradual decline since the day Potter came in which is reflected in results, performances, culture around the club and the ambition of some of the supporters.

We were above Fulham before Potter got the job, they've since outplayed us twice and now sit above us.

You're obviously deluded though and not worth responding to if you think we've been prioritising or seeing attacking football since Potter came in, his style of play was dull at Brighton and it's dull here, literally that entire paragraph reads like you've just copied something from ""what makes a good manager"" because if you think we're showing more attacking patterns under Potter you're clearly not watching the games.

5 goals in our 12 games is astonishingly bad.  we've had more games with less than 0.3xg under Potter as we did under Tuchel. We create nothing regularly.

Pep also has all the money and backing in the world and is also simply a much better manager than potter.

That being said playing hoofball would not even work with these players.

Yes Brighton are playing well with De zebri but some credit has to go to Potter for building the squad and improving the players too. If pep gets sacked this season and next season , they appoint Enrique and win the league , would you say that it's 100% Enriques team while giving 0 credit to Pep ?

Yh undoubtedly. Enzo was our best attacking threat and best creator in midfield and he was playing CDM. Imo we should go with RLC where Gallagher was so that Enzo can have more of a defensive presence and can take a more creating role (one of the biggest issues we had yesterday was how poor positioning was across the board so build up was impossible whenever Enzo was pressed) then have Gallagher energy to get at West Ham‚Äôs best assets- the base of their midfield- whilst providing both Felix and Mudryk more area to roam.,Chelsea,Yes,j763dqw,t1_j762c0g

The Ricketts and Ratcliffe would have been far worse options and regardless of this year's results, I trust ownership to right the wrongs because of their desire to win.

">Tuchel out was widespread before his sacking.

He was one of the most popular managers I've seen, the away fans were chanting his name in Potter's first game, people travel to Salzburg for the game are probably a better indicator than twitter hashtags. You see a loud internet crowd constantly slagging off Mount too, but he was voted POTY in the last 2 years by the fans even when Thiago Silva deserved it more last year.

>Matt Law: Tuchel said no multiple times to Ronaldo as boehly and egbahli wanted a reason why he was saying no. They wanted to sit down with him and look at it from a data aspect and see why didn‚Äôt fit the team and Tuchel simply didn‚Äôt like that.

&#x200B;

>The Athletic: By the end of pre-season, Tuchel felt the meetings were endless, with different owners demanding his time at breakfast, lunch and dinner.  
>  
>Tuchel did not in fact, perhaps understandably, always step up himself, instead sending his agent to recruitment meetings so he could focus on coaching the team. This is understood to have been an early source of tension with Chelsea‚Äôs new owners, who were seeking more direct communication with and input from their head coach as part of the process of identifying transfer targets.  
>  
>Tensions grew outside of recruitment too. Tuchel was unhappy at being asked to feed back to Eghbali about his team meetings and felt he was likely to be sacked during pre-season because of it, only for Boehly to smooth things over.

To me it's pretty clear who is in the wrong when I read between the lines of what's reported and consider how the owners carried themselves since the takeover. Everyone said the main reason why the owners sacked him is Tuchel not being willing to collaborate with the owners on transfers/sporting side of matters as they would like, the quotes above, or them selling Jorginho on the deadline day, are examples of the nature of collaboration the owners demanded. Very few coaches at the high level would be ok with this",Chelsea,Yes,j77aa66,t1_j771dwh

Agree that we'd lack a winger if we sell those players, which is why we can eventually move to sign a natural winger for a more reasonable price. I also wouldn't mind keeping one of those wingers for a season if they were willing to sign a short-term contract extension. I don't think that we'd be short of attackers (you missed Sterling) with that set anyway, Mount would also be competing for the no10 role.",Chelsea,Yes,j7ai2hj,t1_j7agq79

"Yes we know the summer was super rushed, legally speaking the takeover took effect in June, and we had to replace outgoings without a football structure in place.

The football structure is in place. They picked Potter.

They might fire him a year from now if we‚Äôre still at this same conjoncture, but for now, the underperformance is due to multiple factor: squad overhaul on steroids, injury crisis, playing the most games in Europe the last 2 seasons (just like Liverpool and they‚Äôre as toast as we are with a world class manager), changing every department in the club.

They still have to trim the squad because it‚Äôs unmanageable at this size, get a proper medical staff, a performance department and add in coaching support.

That‚Äôs when you can properly evaluate a manager. 

Saying Potter is done is like firing an NFL coach on a team with the worst quarterback in the league. It‚Äôs bad process evaluation.",Chelsea,Yes,j77hmy5,t1_j77gnj8

I don't think all of a sudden a 23 y o player can become awful. This reminds me very much of the lamps rudiger saga. Fucking even Silva looked trash under lamps. 

Also, atleast they were good once upon a time. Potter was never. A mid table gaffa who should be off coaching Southampton and Bournemouth.",Chelsea,Yes,j76klfc,t1_j76jzhb
"I mean they'll all play very regularly if these are our options. As for Felix being effective as a winger, I think he would be. A lot of his skills translate very well, especially to games we dominate. 

>I also wouldn't mind keeping one of those wingers for a season if they were willing to sign a short-term contract extension. I don't think that we'd be short of attackers (you missed Sterling) with that set anyway, Mount would also be competing for the no10 role

I did miss Sterling there who can play both wings (although he's not someone I really see as a long-term option to count on), but Felix would get in ahead of him for me. Mount as a 10 is a catastrophe and I think if he doesn't significantly lower his demands he should be sold. 

I know it's almost overkill to get Felix in permanently, but if he does well the rest of the season we'd be silly not to try. This is an enormously talented player the chance to sign whom might not come again - he's one of those players you get if he's available for a somewhat reasonable fee. And I think it would be easier to convince someone like him, who can play all across a frontline, that he'd get enough minutes compared to a pure winger who's an automatic backup.

Plus, and this shouldn't be ignored - squads will simply have to be better and deeper going forward as the number of games keeps increasing. Plans to expand the Champions League and CWC, pre-season tournaments added in, ideally 4 competitions to make deep runs in. We've already seen how a season with deep runs in all competitions + the CWC wrecked the squad. I think we're still suffering from that, because players have had to be rushed back in or overplayed for over a year now. But these seasons will increasingly become the norm for top clubs.",Chelsea,Yes,j7ajttz,t1_j7ai2hj

">I think we may need a mentality coach.

It's called a manager.

Anyone with a brain cell can see we need a decent manager, people are simply deluding themselves that Potter is one.

Actually in most cases they're not even doing that, whenever Potter is pointed out as the turd he is they simply select the 1 or 2 out of 1,000 managers that were absolutely terrible and turned it around and Pretend Potter will be part of this extremely tiny sample and not just one of the 998 Hodgsons or Moyes's or Scolari's that didn't based on absolutely nothing that Potter is showing.",Chelsea,Yes,j74hycp,t1_j74ffjb

"Really difficult. Nothing is impossible, but we'll be more reliant on the teams in the top four dropping points than on our own performances. 

United and Newcastle (the most likely ones to drop out if any do) dropped 21 points thus far, so if we simplify it and assume they may slip up just that little more (to account for us being slightly beyond halfway), we can drop a maximum of 11 points between now and the end of the season if we want to catch them. That's three losses and one draw or another combo just as small. With our new signings likely needing some time to bed in, that's a really tough ask (especially with our results against top-half teams this season so far). 

Our most difficult match in the next 9 (on paper) is Tottenham away. If we put in a really, really strong run through these coming 9 games we can start looking at the top four a little more seriously, but I wouldn't get my hopes up too much for that.",Chelsea,Yes,j71lqr9,t1_j71jwyq

"I actually do hope it‚Äôs Gallagher. Enzo does best when another player is able to do the dirty work in midfield, and although Gallagher is not amazing defensively, he has shown he is willing to run around and press like a madman to win the ball back which I think could help benefit Enzo in giving him some license to get forward. Whether we play 2 or 3 in midfield, I think Gallagher could be the best option we have amongst healthy players. Enzo, Gallagher, and RLC would be my preferred option though today.",Chelsea,Yes,j71dwzd,t1_j715wtf
"Hall showcased that he ain't ready to play Premier League minutes as a CM. Sloppy first touch and incredibly naive both tactically and on the defensive side of the ball. Loftus-Cheek isn't much better either, he labours around and had to be consistently directed around by Jorginho whenever they played together previously. 

With the options on hand right now a midfield three makes the most sense, helping to spread the responsibility around. Otherwise I'd seriously look at moving Chalobah into the midfield if we're going with a double pivot.",Chelsea,Yes,j71fzkn,t1_j715wtf

Even moving up to 7th to (potentially) qualify for the ECL would likely earn us more money, the degree to which we increase that amount of income skyrockets if we manage to get into 6 and again in 4th. 



Selling him was short sighted and was only ""good business"" if you believe that us not having him is not going to impact our results at all. Something that just clearly isn't true today after we had to play our record signing out of position because we just sold Jorginho despite already being short in midfield",Chelsea,Yes,j74z4y3,t1_j74uzmn
I liked him a lot in Brighton and I still back him. I think our young team will benifit from his team management,Chelsea,Yes,j7120f7,t1_j70xp6a
"Have to agree.  I hope for and expect a much better second half of the season, but with our terrible goal difference taken into account, making up 11 points on Newcastle and/or Man U as well as 8 points on Spurs seems fanciful.  Realistically our only hope of Champions League football next year is to somehow win it this year.",Chelsea,Yes,j713qhu,t1_j70y9vn
This was always the case.,Chelsea,Yes,j71omsd,t1_j71dzde

"Exactly. The difference in the two windows is night and day. There‚Äôs definitely a risk attached to big spending like this, but saying there‚Äôs no plan is baffling to me.",Chelsea,Yes,j72xt25,t1_j72xawt
"It is about keeping the standard for Chelsea FC

How can we just accept that we play like shit after spending so much money? Against fucking Fulham?",Chelsea,Yes,j73zdwg,t1_j73yr0v
"We‚Äôre Chelsea. Every game is a must win, especially a derby. *Especially* a west London derby.

"Classic ziyech right foot shot, waste of space out there right now",Chelsea,Yes,j73k7fv,t1_j73jkyi

This is remarkably based,Chelsea,Yes,j74x5fl,t1_j74rb5z
"Yes - agree with this. This helps. But I feel like we still had the players to win some of those games we lost, and I feel like he was lost in the beginning... and because of this, this trepidation of his, we buckled too easily in those games.",Chelsea,Yes,j7196zo,t1_j718zfu

"Fair enough. I like it - all part of the game for me, and one of the reasons why I like watching football. I like watching how players and coaching carry themselves both on and off the field, especially in cut-throat situations. You can't tell me Mourinho wasn't fascinating to watch and listen too, and when he was winning, I dare say that that mentality - that ""body language,"" if you will - rubbed off on the players... likewise when he was losing and surly.",Chelsea,Yes,j71016g,t1_j70yvpo
"Exactly! When Tuchel came in - in pretty much the same context as Potter - he took the bull by the balls and squeezed hard. Potter has been a limp dick... until now. The last conference has was in control of the message, of himself, and the journalists weren't controlling him. He's got a bit of the mongrel going. I like it.",Chelsea,Yes,j715ba2,t1_j714tno
When?,Chelsea,Yes,j711drb,t1_j7111e4
Let hold our judgement on mudryk and Felix. I think both can become world class but at the moment sterling is still the best of the lot.,Chelsea,Yes,j717ej0,t1_j7178kn
"Towards the end of the season, we also have the big fixtures against United and Newcastle so I think if we get it together now, take our draws here and there due to settling in, and finish the season strong - it's possible but still, football is an unpredictable thing.",Chelsea,Yes,j71maxa,t1_j71lqr9
"Our squad is seriously fearsome
Now

Kepa; James, Silva, Badiashille, cucurella/chilwell; Enzo, kova/Kante; ziyech/Sterling, felix, mudryk; havertz

He isn't finishing 4th in the PL even if we give him ¬£500m per player.",Chelsea,Yes,j74iinf,t1_j744al9

"yeah I saw the same thing and wondered if that was a sign that he'll go with that shape. It will obviously look at lot better when he gets the right profiles in. Cucu LWB, Ziyech RWB, Hall LCM is not ideal",Chelsea,Yes,j725qdk,t1_j724vrs

But Mudryk needs to be high up the pitch for those counters, Chilwell can ping balls through to him.",Chelsea,Yes,j72vipr,t1_j724vrs
"I have a hard time believing these players are out of form, it seems more like they occasionally show up and over perform and we want to believe that‚Äôs their actual level. Tuchel for a very short stint had them playing at an extremely high level and we all convinced ourselves players like mount are a lot better then they actually are. Mendy another great example. That level eventually fell off last season and there has not been a sign that a single one of these players that are just out of form show any sign they can get it back and keep it.

We find all sorts of excuses to defend them instead of admitting they just aren‚Äôt good enough.

If they were, we would be a lot more competitive in the league over the last few year which demands a lot more consistency then a knockout tournament.",Chelsea,Yes,j75dfz0,t1_j75bhcr
Obviously he's not ready. Gallagher is even worse,Chelsea,Yes,j716chp,t1_j716aco
"Watch Rubes play out of position in the pivot, put in a 6/10, recycling possession nicely and offering a physical presence in midfield, and still get absolutely slammed by idiots on this subreddit claiming he's wasting a squad spot--conveniently ignoring the fact that were Mount or Gallagher forced to play in the pivot they'd struggle to put in a 4/10.",Chelsea,Yes,j71vcdu,t1_j717r7i
I'll be sick,Chelsea,Yes,j719kzg,t1_j718ztp
Gallagher can't do the dirty work because he presses like a madman. He'll leave Enzo exposed.,Chelsea,Yes,j71e9ki,t1_j71dwzd

He is. You're just underrating him at this point if you think he's not much better than Lewis Hall. Hall can barely keep the ball.",Chelsea,Yes,j71kwec,t1_j71fzkn
Gallagher has all of those problems and more,Chelsea,Yes,j71kxrt,t1_j71fzkn

"Yea, I can‚Äôt understand not putting Auba in the squad. Idk what has happened behind the scenes but from my POV this decision makes no sense",Chelsea,Yes,j73mlq5,t1_j73lg98

You lot are so clueless.",Chelsea,Yes,j747kmb,t1_j7468ua
"Went to look for it again and it says hes in the squad, i think i took that as a start sorry, but considering kova is out and jorgi is gone i think he starts alongside gall and hall or gall and mount",Chelsea,Yes,j70xt18,t1_j70xlq6
Agreed. Wasn‚Äôt sure from your comment tho,Chelsea,Yes,j7140v8,t1_j7120f7
"I don't think coming ahead of Spurs is a stretch at all especially if we beat them this month (like we should have with a much poorer team if we weren't robbed). Then it's just praying one of Newcastle and Manchester United collapses, which isn't farfetched given stuff like the Eriksen injury or Newcastle's goal drought (but obviously not something we can rely on).",Chelsea,Yes,j71kddh,t1_j713qhu

"I understand your sentiment. Im simply saying to discuss things about what we can/will do, no point discussing about eonwthing which has 0% chance of happening no?

"Fucking hell lad give your head a wobble. Also have you looked at the table? Fulham are having a good season. 


We have players settling, and players coming back from injury, like look at Reece James tonight, that was not exactly a vintage performance from him. Note: I'm not blaming him, he needs to ease back in.",Chelsea,Yes,j73zxoy,t1_j73zdwg
"Oh, no disagreement, Potter has not been good.",Chelsea,Yes,j74vtjz,t1_j74o2at

"Body Language means nothing. Ziyech and Havertz for an example in general have very guarded body language. Carlo from the guy mentioned down there is an example, he never looks particularly invested in anything",Chelsea,Yes,j7119cz,t1_j710au8
"I have, and it‚Äôs not that important. ‚ÄòBody language‚Äô is just another lazy talking point brought up by pundits to create entertainment.

"Most definitely, he's the best out of all the pre January signings",Chelsea,Yes,j71byvr,t1_j717ej0
"For sure, it's absolutely possible, especially if we can fix our form against the better teams in the league, it's just an incredibly difficult prospect from a purely mathematical perspective. 

I'm ever the optimist so even having said the above I believe that we can do it if we hit our stride with this squad quickly, but expecting or demanding a top four finish is just a way of setting oneself up for disappointment. I would unironically argue that it's easier for us to get into the CL next season by winning it this season than it is for us to get top four.",Chelsea,Yes,j71nz05,t1_j71maxa
"Yes you clearly are, you want him banned from the sub ffs. Don't kid yourself. 

The question with his articles, are they factually wrong? we don't care if he's not breaking the hottest shit, it's about being reliable, it also doesn't matter if you like what he has to say or not. You're just trying to cultivate a bubble maybe?",Chelsea,Yes,j734a0l,t1_j7340j6
I think people get too caught up with what commentators are saying and we're actually playing this way most of the time. You just change between a 3 and a 4 depending on the phase of play and commentators lose their mind over it thinking we've changed our whole formation in game whilst we've actually just gone from defending to being in possession and so our formation looks different,Chelsea,Yes,j72aoci,t1_j725qdk
"Yeah I think it sounds good on paper, he may try something close with the available players tonight if James is good to go",Chelsea,Yes,j727tfu,t1_j725qdk

"Yeah, I mean I'm frustrated as well when he's too passive and doesn't grab the game by the scruff of its neck despite being technically capable, but he's ultimately a very solid squad player who plays out of position most of the time. It's why he looked a bit like the old Ruben when playing wingback under Tuchel, as he had more license to drive forwards and play neat crosses in after beating his man.",Chelsea,Yes,j724ckr,t1_j71vcdu

"Yes, Gallagher can definitely be a bit overzealous which is why I would prefer a midfield 3 as said above. In that midfield 3, I would definitely play Gallagher. And I think if Potter tells him to be more defensive and not be so loose positionally, it can help quell his eagerness to get forward and be rash. We shall see.",Chelsea,Yes,j71f147,t1_j71e9ki
Already signed nkunku?,Chelsea,Yes,j714w1c,t1_j711x4r

They missed the second condition that needs to be fulfilled for the B list - a player needs to be eligible to play for a club for at least 2 consecutive years (or 3 years if he was loaned to the club from same association in the meantime)

Yeah they both are the same time. Potter hasn't had a pre season yet and has worse injury crisis than tuchel had. Potter should get more time then.,Chelsea,Yes,j74s9mh,t1_j74q3zd
"Nope, I am wrong on many things, and I own that.

But you are just everywhere with the same comments, again and again and again. 

Why can't you admit that we're doing shite under Potter? It's a fact. It won't hurt. It doesn't mean we want him out. Just let it out, you'll feel better.",Chelsea,Yes,j74wy4q,t1_j74whjz
"This is the third time tuchel has fallen out with the board. Dortmund , PSG and Chelsea now. Maybe he should reflect upon this.",Chelsea,Yes,j74u57f,t1_j74sv0s
Lol this seasons injury woes is much much worse than last season.,Chelsea,Yes,j74xngf,t1_j74x3zh
you just said body language means nothing and then used that same body language as evidence to prove a point so by that logic I would say body language means something mate,Chelsea,Yes,j71515x,t1_j7119cz
"Ziyech‚Äôs body language before the word cup was pathetic. Havertz, despite not reaching his full potential, always carries his head high at the end of the day and runs like a greyhound.

"Agree to disagree. A managers demeanour can set a tone, which is capable of filtering down towards the playing group, which then can be represented out on the pitch. 

The Ancelotti bit showcases that you aren't really familiar with him at all. He's on many occasions been furious with officials and chewed his own players out, even giving Rodrygo a dressing down during a game recently when he stormed off after being subbed. While he is a cool looking customer, he absolutely has a more aggressive side when needed.",Chelsea,Yes,j711nt6,t1_j71107b

Of course we are. But we were doing shite under Tuchel, shite under Lampard and shite under Sarri. Potter isn‚Äôt the problem.",Chelsea,Yes,j74xa27,t1_j74wy4q
Maybe Potter should reflect on the fact none of the 3 teams he's managed in English football were able to average more than 1 goal a game or win more than 1 game a month under his tenure.,Chelsea,Yes,j74zv1f,t1_j74u57f
"No they aren't. At no point this season have we been unable to play a starting 11 full of starting 11 quality players, all in their preferred positions. All we've lost through injury is depth. There have been times where we've had these players but Potter has chosen not to use them, but that's his choice.



Throughout December last season we had an crisis that is incomparable to how easy we have it now. There were multiple games where we couldn't field a full bench, we have a game where we played a midfield 3 of Ziyech-RLC-Mount because that's all we had, we had games where all we had to put on the bench was two keepers and 3 CMs. We actually had impactful problems, where 3 midfielders were all out at the same time and then three defenders were all out at the same time etc. 


Whereas, this season we're having to play Cucurella instead of Chilwell compared to Sarr instead of Chilwell last season or Azpi instead of James, whereas last season we had to play CHO/Pulisic/RLC at RB instead of James etc.

People are so desperate to want us to fail miserably that all the financial and tactical experts have already made up their minds about the new Chelsea even before the ball is kicked.

After Juventus got punished for improperly stating the value of their players, fans of other clubs looked at the 20m we paid to Inter for Casadei and think that it was suspiciously high compared to his perceived value.

"People getting upset when others criticise or insult our players, due to some sort of ""divine rule"" that we should be positive about our players, is really weird to me. It feels like these people are just trying to justify getting irrationally upset that a player they personally like is being criticised. It's fine that some people think alonso was bad and trashed him in the match thread, but I'm not going to engage them over the notion that ""negativity doesn't belong here"", wtf is that shit argument? You have low iq if you don't think alonso was great and that's the point to make, not that our players are beyond criticism or even insults",Chelsea,No,j6wn81o,t3_10rigd9

Not to mention all the twats sticking up for him.,Chelsea,Yes,j6xarv1,t1_j6x9vdq
He's a leader and dreams of captaining the club one day. I am sure he takes it personally when Chelsea fail to perform regardless of him being present in the line-up or not. I think he'll feel more bad about not playing the champions league than having a lower salary.,Chelsea,Yes,j6w54vr,t1_j6w4s5h
Well him being injury prone is part of the reason why we're doing so bad,Chelsea,Yes,j6w6bx9,t1_j6w4s5h
That's exactly who it'll be.,Chelsea,Yes,j6vxx5x,t1_j6vxuuy
"W Fofana is back so it‚Äôs Enzo, Felix, and Mudryk.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w1xnr,t1_j6vxuuy
It would be nonsense not to pick Felix to be honest. We‚Äôve only got him til the end of the season so may as well use him for the only competition we‚Äôre left in,Chelsea,Yes,j6vyczq,t1_j6vxuuy
"Enzo and Mudryk are undebatable and while I feel for Badiashile because he‚Äôs been brilliant, we have enough CB depth with Fofana coming back. Felix the third one for me.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w21o1,t1_j6vxuuy
"Is their a reason for limiting it to three, I know not every team is gonna buy as much many players as Chelsea but still.",Chelsea,Yes,j6vze2p,t1_j6vxuuy
"We also need to drop one player from the current squad in order to do that. 

Imagine it's Ziyech...",Chelsea,Yes,j6w1y3z,t1_j6vxuuy
"Leave out Felix, since he's leaving in a few months anyway. We're nowhere near good enough to actually win the competition, so we may as well use it as a chance for Potter to work out how we set up all of our shiny new toys in big games.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w2p6b,t1_j6vxuuy
"Mudryk to start, maybe Madueke too if Ziyech is still stuck in France üòÜ 

After that, I'm looking forward to seeing more of Badiashile  and maybe an Enzo cameo off the bench.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w5ytq,t1_j6w5378
Noni is fit? I am not sure about his fitness status but only thing I have heard about him is that he's injury prone. If he's fit won't mind seeing him play for sometime.,Chelsea,Yes,j6w62xw,t1_j6w5378
"That could be the end for them as a club potentially, Jesus. I don't think they're prepared for relegation, who could have seen this coming",Chelsea,Yes,j6xpufl,t1_j6xlaxy
"There‚Äôs still a few teams at the bottom that won‚Äôt get more points than them as they‚Äôre that bad, so it might be tight.",Chelsea,Yes,j6y344f,t1_j6xlaxy

I loved granovskaia but so far i am really liking eghbali,Chelsea,Yes,j6x6cyc,t1_j6wygks
"The pressure for Mudryk was actually mad. We were playing at Anfield and at halftime the pundits were already calling for him to come in the game and make a difference. The fact he did come in and immediately provided a spark despite the pressure signals great things in my opinion. 

As for Enzo, he‚Äôs a big game player. Against PSG and France he loved defending Neymar/Mbappe for periods of time when they dribbled. A lot of his best efforts against the best competition. I think he ran the most or second most in the WC final and made 10 tackles. 

Enzo has played in big games, which is why I think he won‚Äôt buckle under pressure here. Played in big games in Argentina and big games for the national teams. He‚Äôs only 21 too, which I think is huge to have that experience at that age.",Chelsea,Yes,j6xjnqs,t1_j6wylvf
"Seeing Enzo's passmap across the WC had a lot of balls played to the wings too, which will be excellent for Mudryk and Madueke",Chelsea,Yes,j6wza1o,t1_j6wylvf
Gallagher or Hall most likely. It's incredible that we can spend that much money and be forced to line up with that midfield + likely start Azpi or Trev at RB.,Chelsea,Yes,j6wwjw9,t1_j6wvvjn
"Enzo might not even be available lol

"damn, what's the deal with Kova again?

He got injured before Liverpool game and hasn't came back yet, while I believe we haven't seen any report saying what exactly happened.",Chelsea,Yes,j6xl8ab,t1_j6wvvjn
"Presumably Conor, not ideal but what option do we have.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wwdbr,t1_j6wvvjn
Imagine having 4 senior midfielders and 3 of them are injury prone. Then you have RLC who will never be good enough to be a starter there and Gallagher who will probably be sold. This is why we still have work to do in rejuvenating that area of the pitch,Chelsea,Yes,j6wx457,t1_j6wvvjn
"Wonder if that Means chilwell James and RLC start and are then subbed off, or come on round the 60 min mark",Chelsea,Yes,j6wwhen,t1_j6wvvjn
Ziyech fanboys are something else,Chelsea,Yes,j6z5eas,t1_j6z53l3
"I fucking love it. LIVERPOOL fans complaining that we have an infinite money glitch when they themselves are owned by an American sports conglomerate. 

We got lucky twice, but Liverpool aren't exactly in the position to be complaining about not having enough investment.",Chelsea,Yes,j6vxyyd,t1_j6vupkr

">‚ÄúHe just felt a little bit of tightness in his calf but we are hopeful for Fulham,‚Äù Potter told Chelsea TV. ‚ÄúHe felt it at the end of the Crystal Palace game.

Did Potter says Kova isn‚Äôt fit for Fulham?,Chelsea,Yes,j6xbh57,t1_j6wzu2h
What'd he do?,Chelsea,Yes,j6z4ail,t1_j6z2s1s
I really want to see a young defensive midfielder we have get the nod instead of spending 100m on another midfielder.,Chelsea,Yes,j6vts1r,t1_j6vtdhc
He‚Äôs gonna get his chance at Madrid at some point in the future.,Chelsea,Yes,j70w2yy,t1_j706a1r
"Idk, his man management left a lot to be desired. I was never a big TT guy, so maybe I‚Äôm biased. I think Jose, Conte, Ancelotti were better managers for us, with Ancelotti being the clear best",Chelsea,Yes,j70fql6,t1_j706a1r
Make it so you have to use the ticket to register points,Chelsea,Yes,j6xepr6,t1_j6xb3jy
End of the month.,Chelsea,Yes,j6vyyuw,t1_j6vuaef

I read there‚Äôs a chance he‚Äôs available for the Dortmund game. Either way it‚Äôs looking like this month for sure.,Chelsea,Yes,j6w0wyk,t1_j6vuaef
"~~Felix is still suspended for next week, back for the UCL game~~",Chelsea,Yes,j6w6h84,t1_j6w60u0
"Rough, lol.",Chelsea,Yes,j6y0li4,t1_j6xggp1
"Enzo will start if his work permit is sorted and he‚Äôs eligible to play. It‚Äôs not like the Mudryk situation where he hasn‚Äôt played in months and needs to build up fitness. It‚Äôs more like the Felix situation where he‚Äôs just levels above everyone else and will start immediately even without training with the team. Yes, the midfield role is obviously more demanding tactically, but still. Potter will tell him about the ABC‚Äôs of the gameplan and he‚Äôll do the job.",Chelsea,Yes,j6y240g,t1_j6xggp1
How is kova injured?,Chelsea,Yes,j6ytxj9,t1_j6xggp1
"The board signs off on everything so credit should be given to Boehly, Eghbali, Feliciano, Mark Walter, Goldstein, and Wyss. They're all financiers with credit heft. 

Eghbali is definitely the closer though.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wewqh,t1_j6w2mcf
Good cop bad cop negotiation strategy. Eghbali good Boehly bad.,Chelsea,Yes,j6w42z2,t1_j6w2mcf
"Welcome to the fan club, fasten your seatbelts because it's always chaos around here.",Chelsea,Yes,j6y02yl,t1_j6xxw2d
"Another Yank here diehard blues fan ‚Äî men and women. Sam Kerr may be my favorite footballer; she could score in the PL! American football is a stupid sport that young athletes are literally killing themselves to play ‚Äî CTE. My top dream is still my baseball team winning the World Series (dumb name for a Cup), but maybe not when Chelsea wins their next CL trophy.",Chelsea,Yes,j6yrl9q,t1_j6xxw2d
"Not that unlikely tbh. Fitness could still keep Reece and Chilwell out, Enzo will have to come in instantly because Kant√©, Zakaria are still out injured and Jorginho is gone (the alternative is lining up with a Kova-Gallagher/RLC pivot and surely that's worse), Mudryk and Madueke will probably start (Sterling still likely not fit, no way Ziyech plays after the clownery that happened). Felix is out, so Mount or Gallagher will have to play as the 10. 

So we could end up fielding an XI that's still weak in some areas (fullbacks, 10), and really new to the team otherwise (wingers, pivot).

Wouldn't be surprised if this was a hard game.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wcsg9,t1_j6wbg86
football script writers won't allow anything else.,Chelsea,Yes,j6wdrzu,t1_j6wbg86

"On another note, I tried first time playing football manager, got for 41$ and I got mind fucked. Think my ADHD kicked in hard

Gave up after 31 minutes lol",Chelsea,Yes,j6w5w51,t1_j6w5if7
They‚Äôre keeping him for the summer for ‚Äòmarketing purposes‚Äô I think. Another ‚Äòmarquee‚Äô signing.,Chelsea,Yes,j6wnco2,t1_j6w5if7
"Yeah the situation seems fairly
Straightforward

Koulibaly silva fofana chalobah will more than suffice

Mount Sterling ziyegg  etc won‚Äôt so felix and mudryk have to play",Chelsea,Yes,j6wql8b,t1_j6wovpd
Enzo isn‚Äôt a pure pivot and he‚Äôs going to be better than them,Chelsea,Yes,j71jvtc,t1_j6wp7zo
"My God, if we didn't sign Enzo we would have to play RLC and Gallagher together",Chelsea,Yes,j6wvg7w,t1_j6wv3nt
His inability to keep fit is getting more and more concerning,Chelsea,Yes,j6x0ak8,t1_j6wv3nt
already done,Chelsea,Yes,j6ww5ny,t1_j6ww266
Side note - how on earth do I change my flair?,Chelsea,Yes,j6yq1c2,t1_j6ypyeh
"For some reason I fully believe he‚Äôll be a permanently signing. If he‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs not the end of the world, as we have players in his role, but I really think he‚Äôll stick around",Chelsea,Yes,j6z9sqz,t1_j6yyi1z
"Could also be down to him being suspended, some of his media has been with the injured group.

Everyone is saying that if we wanted to keep him, it would be possible.",Chelsea,Yes,j6z35h7,t1_j6yyi1z
Chelsea will get that paperwork done in time for him to play against Fulham and Potter look unbothered when he said it. All Nizaar said is if the paperwork is not done in time he cannot feature against Fulham.,Chelsea,Yes,j6x6ubi,t1_j6x589y
"Summer was quite random and obviously nowhere near the January window but I‚Äôm still happy with 5 of the 6 signings we made tbh.

Fofana is a world class talent, just need to sort his fitness. Cucurella is top quality and has proven it in the PL, same with Sterling.

Koulibaly has had a rough start but you don‚Äôt just lose the ability he‚Äôs shown for a decade, it‚Äôs clearly a confidence and adjustment issue. He‚Äôll be fine.

Zakaria has looked brilliant tbh and I would have no issue making his move permanent.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w7dai,t1_j6w28zl
"Pre-Winter window we also saw the arrival of the recruitment team, that played a key role.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w42w8,t1_j6w28zl
"Apart from Felix all the new signings were relative unknowns around 6 months ago. 

Hopefully this indicates a more curated recruitment strategy rather than just picking up big names like Sterling, Aubameyang and Koulibaly",Chelsea,Yes,j6w4wnm,t1_j6w28zl
Not hard to see why,Chelsea,Yes,j6w2d1a,t1_j6w28zl
He has never once been reported to be a bad teammate,Chelsea,Yes,j6whddn,t1_j6wg0w8
I feel for the lad. I hope he can get his head right and finish the season without the atmosphere being too toxic. If he's up to it I'd start him vs Fulham considering who's available,Chelsea,Yes,j6wvwgi,t1_j6wg0w8
"Yeah ownership was incredibly disrespectful to him on this

Imagine what the other players in the squad are thinking",Chelsea,Yes,j6wjbf3,t1_j6wg0w8
"nah its better to have 90% geriatrics and tourists so we hear ""Chelsea Chelsea Chelsea"" once every 10 minutes and thats it",Chelsea,Yes,j6wcv8z,t1_j6w8vyj

Apparently Reece from bench,Chelsea,Yes,j6w6wzu,t1_j6w67va
"James, Chilwell, RLC and Sterling fit.",Chelsea,Yes,j6x04eq,t1_j6w67va
No,Chelsea,Yes,j6wcj4d,t1_j6wc6ju
The PL is too competitive for any team to do that. Even perfect Man City didn't,Chelsea,Yes,j6wk69d,t1_j6widuk
"> My question to all of you, how many more signings until we are truly able to dominate the league for the next decade?

No amount will make you dominate for a decade. In fact it's not exactly a matter of quantity but quality. We can sign as many as we won't but if they don't click, we won't challenge for titles.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wjwm1,t1_j6widuk
"I really feel like we should've kept J5 and sold Kante, he's been too much of a non factor recently whereas Jorgi has been very reliable

It's a tricky situation",Chelsea,Yes,j6wzlyh,t1_j6wvhcq
"Keep him. He won't be injured forever and will be back one day to remind us how good he is. He may have to play less often when everyone's healthy, but he's still Kante, he's good enough to play here.",Chelsea,Yes,j6xq83p,t1_j6wvhcq
"Get rid of him. He's already half retired and we need to move on eventually, kicking the can down the road doesn't solve anything.",Chelsea,Yes,j6x3hae,t1_j6wvhcq
Matt law has said it‚Äôs considerably lower than Jorginho‚Äôs contract and I think Jorgi was on 150k/week? His deal is probably similar to Mudryks. Which is kind of nuts. The board gave K2 and Sterling 300k/week but they‚Äôve righted their wrongs with the recent transfers,Chelsea,Yes,j6xio4v,t1_j6xfc59
"No, I do not believe we had a reliable source give us a number",Chelsea,Yes,j6xgzz3,t1_j6xfc59
"Duncan Castles said his salary can reach 5m net, but not sure if that's now or with performance bonuses or whatever.",Chelsea,Yes,j6xig9x,t1_j6xfc59
Probably has to do with the fact we sold him in the middle of the season. Or maybe the way some bonuses in the fee are accounted or something.,Chelsea,Yes,j6zgdzv,t1_j6zfws9
"But it doesn‚Äôt have to be KK starting, we have Fofana and Chalobah who can play next to Thiago

We don‚Äôt really have anyone who can replace the creativity Felix brings up top",Chelsea,Yes,j6wnfyk,t1_j6wk0u6
"I know Koulibaly has been bad, but it feels dangerous to leave behind someone with so much Champions League experience in favour of an admittedly promising but still very young player.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wucno,t1_j6wk0u6
Thiago Silva seems to be showing great promise with the amount of game time he's getting recently. He's one for the future that's for sure.,Chelsea,Yes,j6z4kt1,t1_j6ypum7
Willy was here the season after Higuain as well I think? Lampard dropped Kepa for Willy at one point if I‚Äôm not mistaken.,Chelsea,Yes,j6ysz2o,t1_j6yromq

I'm willing to bet you haven't, although keen to be proven wrong.",Chelsea,Yes,j6ww68e,t1_j6wv2lo
It hurts losing to them . I know they are our little neighbors and i quite like it when they beat our rivals but i do enjoy putting them in their place .,Chelsea,Yes,j6xcj38,t1_j6wv2lo
He was bought for ‚Ç¨10 million 6 months ago. It would be wild if people started treating it as normal for a good half season in a lesser league to add ‚Ç¨110 million to your value,Chelsea,Yes,j6w2wc4,t1_j6vxnty
"Enzo gets in any team bar city (maybe), Felix would make any team, Mudryk remains to be seen",Chelsea,Yes,j6yq2xw,t1_j6yinli
"Enzo: Starts for them all

Mudryk: Would have a shout for starting in most of them. He definitely starts for Liverpool and Spurs. He'd battle it out for starting soots at Arsenal and City, and he'd have a shout at United if this Rashford form ends.

Felix: Has the quality to start at any of them, just depends if coaches would accomodate him

Badiashile: Would need to see more of him but I think he starts for Liverpool and Spurs, he'd be rotation at City, Arsenal and United. Wouldn't be surprised if he makes a case for starting in those teams though

Madueke/Fofana etc: Rotation/prospects

Gusto: Has a shout for starting for all of them",Chelsea,Yes,j6zj3k8,t1_j6yinli
"Enzo walks into any of them, Felix would depend on the formation they're playing but probably wouldn't struggle too much to do the same, Mudryk probably does the same but he's a bit more of an unknown at the highest level, Badiashile should be able to fight for a place with most of the current CB pairings in the league but would struggle to cement himself as most of the pairings are playing pretty well atm (he's only really managed to muscle in for us because Koulibaly's been awful). 

The young players (Santos, D. Fofana, etc) obviously don't. Madueke and Gusto would be depth options for most, though Gusto might start for United and would probably be playing for Liverpool rn given Trent's recent form.",Chelsea,Yes,j6zerfl,t1_j6yinli
"Not really, we paid 12m euros + addons, which is largely similar to Chuk, Santos, Fofana. Highly doubt that the new owners who arrived a few months earlier decided to enter into a scheme of corruption with Inter who haven‚Äôt even been accused of the same crimes as Juve, as part of some get-back for Lukaku.",Chelsea,Yes,j6xcaae,t1_j6x5qxp

what does that mean?",Chelsea,Yes,j6x8qxx,t1_j6x5qxp
"no, fuck this cunt",Chelsea,Yes,j6xkwwk,t1_j6xji0u
I don't think he fits Potter's system as a sweeper keeper. He is closer to Mendy as a shot stopper. I think Sanchez and Raya are the two in the EPL that I have seen us linked to.,Chelsea,Yes,j6yovdl,t1_j6xji0u
I‚Äôm still hoping Enzo‚Äôs work permit got sorted and he‚Äôs starting tomorrow.,Chelsea,Yes,j6y1nd2,t1_j6y1awm

"Mitrovic won't be able to move with Thiago & Benoit on him. If the guys avoid making individual mistakes (like last time), we can win easily.. all we need is to score like 2 goals",Chelsea,Yes,j6ynzmj,t1_j6y1awm
"Not sure about the news, but funnily enough, many such teams might cost less than what we paid this transfer window.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w44ub,t1_j6w24jo
The sidebar has info about ticketing. In general I think ticket reseller are not legal in the UK. The proper way to get tickets is to buy a memebership to Chelsea which then provides you the opportunity to buy tickets directly from the club. Someone else can probably tell you more though.,Chelsea,Yes,j6y9yzu,t1_j6y8qat
"Don‚Äôt see us selling Trevoh. Didn‚Äôt the ownership just renew him a few months back? Same with Conor and Maatsen, they seem to be big on youth I don‚Äôt think we would sell unless the offer is too high to refuse.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w3m05,t1_j6vurhi
">  Azpi(1-2m) Chalobah

No way both are leaving, RJ is injured so often, that leaves Gusto, a 20 years old to deal with the entire 60 games season. Such a bad take this is.

Also, calm down with prices.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w4cb9,t1_j6vurhi
"Here's a hot take - don't sell Maatsen. Chilwell has interest from City and if the fee is right, I would consider selling. His injury record is unfortunately horrendous and his wages are pretty big too I believe. Maatsen is currently playing an excellent season and his profile is similar to Chilwell's. This could be a risk but with Cucurella at the club and Chilwell injured so frequently, I don't even think it is. We can always look for another LB if Maatsen doesn't end up working out.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w1dvt,t1_j6vurhi
Pulisic because of his age is worth at least 35 I‚Äôd say.,Chelsea,Yes,j6vvo69,t1_j6vurhi
"If someone offers 60 million for Kai Havertz, we will probably sell. It will be difficult to sell many names mentioned here because of wages. Same with Lukaku. I don‚Äôt imagine there‚Äôs anyone off limits this summer other than Reece and the recently signed players.

I also have a feeling that Todd will see everyone else on the Bellingham hype train and won't be able to resist getting involved. Not that I think he will come here - but we'll certainly look into it.

"I read this somewhere too, but there's so much talk about us having to choose only 2 of our new signings that I'm confused. If this is indeed the case, then clearly the club's goal of amassing a set of young players worked for us short-term too. 

Of those three, I think it's a no-brainer to leave Madueke out. Now that Ziyech is staying, I think he deserves a spot due to his form and attitude anyway - and we all know he gets motivated for the CL. Would like to see him play a key role in the CL. And anyway, this half season was going to be about settling in for Madueke - Sterling and Ziyech have that side covered for now. The other attackers are pretty much needed given the form of our existing alternatives.

"I think Tuchel earned the respect of players but maybe not as much love/devotion as the others (nor hate either, in the case of some under Jose and Conte). 

I thought Tuchel might be a good long term fit because he was a winner but not as hot headed as Jose and Conte. I really liked the way he handled the press in times of pressure. He always seemed to put a calm, intelligent and methodical spin on things and rarely gave the media a chance to blow up a small story into a bigger one. 

My theory is that if we had the new sporting department in place in the summer things might have gone different with Tuchel. I don't think he respected Boehly enough to accept his ideas but at the same time he did not want to be directing recruitment either. He was probably pretty mad at the whirlwind changes leaving him to too much non-coaching work. In a presser he made a specific comment about Cech being a big loss. If there were some actual experts in the room at the time laying out the project to him then maybe he'd have bought in.

In terms of rankings I'd go Jose #1, Carlo #2. Then probably Conte would just edge Tuchel but I think they are pretty similar in terms of making some amazing achievements but not being able to build.",Chelsea,Yes,j70i8sl,t1_j70fql6

"Transfer windows are shit. People spend a month shitting on players that have given everything for us whilst fawning over the new shiny players (that they'll be shitting on in a month's time, whilst fawning over new shiny things that they want in summer). 



The best thing that's happened this window is what I've just said. The big spend seems to have shifted people focus away from excuses and towards winning as a minimum expectation. So, I'm very happy with it. 



You have to remember that we won the CL with Werner and Havertz up top, we won the Premier League with Moses etc. Winning is all about mentality, belief and commitment and that's why we're such a successful club. PSG and City have endless money and talent and yet they can only dream of having a trophy cabinet like ours. 



You can't buy winning mentality and it we had it in abundance at our club and were (and maybe still are) at risk of losing it and needing to slowly rebuild it again over many years. The change of tone from our fans after this transfer window and the clear drive from our owners to ensure they tried to buy the best of the best gives me hope that we can maintain that winning at all cost mentality.

"Think it's a bit too premature to be thinking this. If Chilwell is fit and does well for the rest of the season, then we'd be foolish to sell, to a rival especially. He's a far more complete option at LB than Cucurella, and can play both LB+LWB - so if anything we should be looking to sell Cucurella if he's the more limited player. I believe Colwill will be in the squad next season onwards, and he can easily play the more reserved LB role that Cucurella plays. 

Either way, provided Chilwell ends the season well I'd easily postpone this decision for another year. Think the ownership can convince Maatsen to extend his contract and go out on another loan/worst case sale with buy-back.

"I really like the idea of signing Roque and giving him the backup striker role. Every time we signed a striker to play ahead of Havertz we just came back to him anyway. I'd rather see whether he can work with better players around him that complement how a false 9 plays - so far he hasn't had that. Roque could be eased in behind him and actually be given meaningful minutes in cup games.

He'd easily be better than Aubameyang, so that's a squad upgrade too. And if Havertz still doesn't work out, we can go back for a starting striker or, if Roque has developed well until then, even hand him that role.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wbfmw,t1_j6wam81
"Agreed. Anyone expecting an all action CM might be a bit disappointed, but he‚Äôll make a massive difference to how we get up the pitch. Can‚Äôt see him stacking goals and assists but that‚Äôs not why we signed him.",Chelsea,Yes,j6we4d0,t1_j6w9r4p

"It sends a sickening message to women . Its the same with Arsenal and Partey . One of the worst things is the girls father took Greenwoods side .

It‚Äôs like Stockholm Syndrome .",Chelsea,Yes,j6xbwa3,t1_j6xb42d

"Last time I checked we were 10th in the Premier league and playing absolutely terribly. Were in no position to compete at the top level, since Potter still has no idea what our team is supposed to actually look like, especially now we've added another ‚Ç¨350 million worth of players, so we may as well take the opportunity to try and figure that out.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w4aux,t1_j6w3pn1

"No amount of winning mentality is going to overcome the amount of dross we've had in our squad for the last 6 - 7 seasons. The single Champions League we got in 2021 is not representative of how good we've been as a club since 2017, did you realise that? We overachieved massively. And whilst it was wonderful winning it, it has also massively damaged expectations of where we were and are as a club. 

Domestically we've been practically irrelevant since Conte and have had the odd cup run here and there. That's it. The Europa League was nice but is just a box ticking exercise and reflects the failure of Conte's last season. People would laugh at Wenger's Arsenal for getting top 4 year on year under him but that's basically how we were for the majority of a decade whilst spending ridiculous amounts of money.

You need to accept that the club was stagnant and there was no better time to rebuild the club.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wznze,t1_j6wxvgn

"Yeah no, there's no scenario where we should sell Cucurella because Colwill, a CB, can fill in at LB when Chilwell, who's been non-stop injured for a long time, is injured. In reality, we'd just end up regularly lining up with a CB out of position at LB. 

Cucurella also isn't playing like a CB at LB, that's not giving him enough credit. He hasn't been great for us but Potter has hinted at various reasons (health, family issues), and there's a reason why City wanted him. He was good for Brighton under Potter. Would be crazy to sell him.

As for Chilwell being able to play LB + LWB, so is Maatsen. The main differences are that Maatsen is younger and can stay fit.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w4sk2,t1_j6w2dh3

That's not even my comment is it. I've seen some people literally bemoan anything to do with our signings. It's a genuine question. How can you support a club if you're not excited for the players they've signed to play. It's baffling to me.,Chelsea,Yes,j6wga4i,t1_j6wfffs

The overall damage it does to the Serie A can‚Äôt be underestimated from a economic perspective (and automatically therefore also sporting and supporting perspective).
Everyone will have interests in Juventus staying in the serie a or going up as fast as possible.

Lampard in 09/10 had 45 goal involvements (27 goals, 18 assists) in 51 games, which is a 0.88/game rate.  Both phenomenal seasons, but Lampard just edges it.

We would have to sell to keep spending to balance things, but there is some leeway with the way FFP works. Revenues have to be raised thereafter.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wwd1j,t1_j6wp8cg
"Yes fair enough, I‚Äôm just pointing out reasons why Badiashille could be picked over Felix",Chelsea,Yes,j6wt9xl,t1_j6wrusn

">Yeah no, there's no scenario where we should sell Cucurella because Colwill, a CB, can fill in at LB when Chilwell, who's been non-stop injured for a long time, is injured. In reality, we'd just end up regularly lining up with a CB out of position at LB. 

My point was that we'd sell Cucurella eventually and replace him with Maatsen. As early as next summer. So we'd then have 2 LBs, with Colwill being able to fulfill a deeper role as well. The only aspect in which Cucurella is better than Chilwell at for me is his willingness and ability to play the ball in between the lines during build-up. Colwill is also excellent at that, and when Potter came in initially he seemed to want the left-back to play that kind of deeper/passing centric role with the right-back bombing up (he didn't change this even when Chilwell, a more offensive LB, or when Azpi, a more defensive RB, came into the team).

As for City wanting Cucurella, they wanted him for 35-40m. Not to mention that they also wanted a few players in the past who would've been ill-suited to them, that they dodged due to rivals. He'd have been fine, but likely not nearly as good as the best LBs around.",Chelsea,Yes,j6w51t1,t1_j6w4sk2

"Definitely realism but support at least. I've seen people trash a player who hasn't even set foot on the pitch. I don't even think it's right to trash any player who plays for the club full stop. Skepticism is fine. Having no expectations is fine. What I find annoying is negativity and writing off new signings almost entirely. There's skepticism and there's being a know it all. No one knows how the signings are going to pan out. Though blind optimism is bad, I think that is better than full on negativity and acting like one knows how it's going to pan out. Trying to look at the bright side is much preferable to me but maybe life philosophies.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wiimg,t1_j6whch0
"U can support a club and not be excited for their signings very easily. I think if your club signs a player then u shouldn‚Äôt go as far as to insult the actual player, but this narrative that we have to completely get behind anything Chelsea does or we‚Äôre not real fans is just ridiculous. The fact is, the transfer policy that we have adopted is very risky and parallels can easily be drawn between the players we‚Äôve brought in and historic major PL flops. If fans want to talk about the potential downsides, then that doesn‚Äôt mean that they aren‚Äôt fans. U can love the club enough to critique it.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wgzpr,t1_j6wga4i

"Well, that's a headscratcher then. So we can de-register one player? 

I really wouldn't want to do it, but if we have to I'd de-register Pulisic. Would suck for him but he is kinda surplus. Mudryk, Felix and Enzo would be my three as Fofana will be back to play in defence anyway (gets tricky rotating CBs though so would effectively mean Badiashile doesn't play a lot in PL bar injuries).",Chelsea,Yes,j6wouyp,t1_j6wo64e

"Down the road I‚Äôd assume that outgoing would cover it, but your talking about spending at least another 300 million. The idea about having the strongest possible team is probably accurate, but it‚Äôs just a question of practicality with would the board be willing to spend that much money without the long contracts? I‚Äôd imagine this window was basically just our rebuild being mostly done in one foul swoop and moving forward we‚Äôll spend like any other big team.

Yeah. I definitely agree with the last point. I mean I'm not saying they aren't fans. I understand criticism about certain decisions the club takes and the strategy. The major thing is if you're constantly negative about the club and everything around it. What's the point? Isn't supporting a club meant to be something that brings you joy?

"Is it your first football manager game? There's a bunch of things I've learned through playing the series over 25 years that are of obvious benefit, I imagine it's pretty daunting going in blind.

First things I'd suggest, to make things easier:

- download some tactics. There's a guy with the name Knap that posts on sigames forum, Google Knap sigames tactics and you should find a link to a bunch of proven tactics that make things miles easier.

- on the responsibilities tabs in game, let your assistants do all the press conferences, delegate responsibility for everything except first team contracts. Makes it miles more streamlined.

- whilst there's loads of information and options in game available, you can safely ignore most of it. Analytics, training etc. can all be skipped.

The core gameplay loop once you've done the above is simply going match to match, selecting your team and delivering team talks. Of course you can tweak instructions mid game. Between games, read the news if you want, deal with any player related issues as they come up. In the summer and winter set a few days aside for contract renewals, and use the scouting tab to find players you want to sign. At the start of the season (1st September) you'll need to register your PL and CL squads.

There will be an extensive database update mid-late Feb with all the January transfers added to the game, so you might want to wait til then if you want to play as current Chelsea.",Chelsea,Yes,j6wgyxv,t1_j6wa9uz
