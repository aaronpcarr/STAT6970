"""I arrived at Sao Paulo when I was 11 or 12 years old, and there were 300 people,"" he explained in an interview with Movistar+.

""It was a trial and they were going to select 50 players.

""I played up front because I had a good physique, but I remember that the coach asked who was a goalkeeper and then three people raised their hand and then he asked who was a forward and 50 people raised their hand.

""So I kept my hand down, there was a lot of competition.""

""He then asked who was a No.10 and there were another 50 with their hands up.

""Then he asked who was a defensive midfielder and eight put their hands up and I said 'me, I'm a defensive midfielder'.

""They insisted that I was built to be a forward, but I insisted that no, that I was a defensive midfielder and that's how it all started.""

I see him inverting quite a lot now, he takes up the CM position whenever Shaw is out wide.

"Before WW arrives, EtH practically had no strikers for most games of the first half of the season. He is so good at getting the best out of players at his disposal.

Yesterday was a showpiece of team spirit atm, from the beautiful moments that led to the second goal to the way that the team sticked together and ran their asses of in the last 20 minutes. Not having Case for the next 3 games is a problem for sure, but if the team continues to believe in themselves and keep working hard, I have high hope that they will be able to pull off good results.",Manchester United,No,j7a7mec,t3_10u5d5h
"I think talk of playing Lindelof or Lisandro in midfield is premature. Sabitzer can swap in for Casemiro's role in a midfield 2 with one of Fred or McTominay joining him, preferably Fred.

"Didn't watch the full game yesterday. But, from the extended highlights, would I be right to say Wan Bissaka had another solid game?

Towards start of game in opening 10 mins, he put in a wonderful cross in the box using a technique I didn't think he had. His development has been brilliant to see in his overall attacking play. He also played his part in that second goal in which he kept the momentum going. Often times prior to this season he'd have potentially been the player slowing that phase of play down.

He's always going to have his haters and because some people don't find him easy on the eye, will jump onto any opportunity to shit on him like the Arsenal match where people wanted him gone.

But, to me, he's more than proving his use and has had another fantastic turnaround. ETH has worked wonders and ABW's attitude also seems brilliant. Not the type of player to sulk when he was given no chances pre-World Cup and once he got his chance in the League Cup match v Burnley, has not looked back. With Dalot returning who was also brilliant pre-World Cup, we have two very good rights backs for the rest of the season who depending on the game, will have their uses. I know it's still a while away, but would like to see AWB given the starting spot for the league cup final when the time comes.",Manchester United,No,j7aknjk,t3_10u5d5h

However, I distinctly remember him having poor attitude on the pitch at times and not tracking back on the right wing. He had awful chemistry with Ronaldo and our right back.

He had all the skill to be one of the best strikers in the world but his attitude seemed a bit off at times. We don’t need this in our team right now. Please keep him away from the first team. And that’s even BEFORE we go into the moral issue about him coming back and the fact he hasn’t trained with the first team or played competitive football for over a year.

"Regardless of it being correct or not, there’s something so strange and theatrical about the way the VAR is able to make drama out of an ambiguous referee decision.

Yesterday’s incident, with everyone eventually walking away without too much disdain, would normally be a couple of yellows at worst and move on.

Instead, the referee gets summoned like a student to the screen, in which they officially have to give their opinion one way or another instead of it being one of those ambiguous calls. They’re basically told “*we think this is a red, and here’s a specific distant angle and looped video out of context to prove it. But if you don’t think hands on throat is is a red then that’s on you and it will go down officially as you’re ok with that*”. 

I get that it’s needed for many calls but in this case to single our one bit of collective handbags is ridiculous. There was a red not a while back where a player literally kicked the ball and their “kicking” foot landed on the opposing players shin.

"The selective bias of VAR is absolutely shocking.  

VAR is supposed to intervene if the ref has made a clear and obvious error.  If a punch had been thrown or an elbow or a kick, or if Casemiro really *had* attempted to throttle Hughes, then fine.  But the MOTD replay last night shows this was not the case.  And Casemiro and Hughes were hugging each other about 3 seconds later, does this really happen if Casemiro was throttling Hughes?

If it were the other way around, and a Palace player had done what Cas did, even with the misleading slo-mo angle I would have fully expected to see ""VAR checking for possible red card""  flash up on screen, and moments later seen the old ""VAR check complete"" message, and the game moves on, and I and everyone else would have been fine with it... as long as it is consistent!

Read someone last night criticising United fans for their use of ""whataboutism"" arguments.  But how else are you supposed to point out hypocrisies or inconsistencies without using ""whataboutisms""?  Really hate that term, because 9 times out of 10 the term is used as an attempt to delegitimise perfectly legitimate arguments, as if it to say ""aha, you used a whataboutism, therefore you've lost the argument"", as if that's the trump card or something.

VAR was supposed to make the game fairer, but it's actually doing the opposite.  The completely inconsistent and selective way in which it is being applied is making the game worse, not better.

And the worst thing is, it's very unlikely they will come out and say they got it wrong, they never explain any of their baffling decisions... most the time they bottle making any kind of decision, so I'd like them to come out and explain why they chose this particular incident, based on one angle (that turns out to be highly misleading) and just a few frames of motion to come to their decision.  If it was a human error in the heat of the moment, then fine, come out and say that!  Otherwise justify why Casemiro was singled out here.

• 21 goals in finals which is the 3rd most ever behind Messi and Pele.

• 100+ goals for 3 different clubs.

• 77 goals for Brazil which makes him the joint top scorer with Pele, and 55 assists which is the most in international history tied with Puskas (132 G/A in 124 games for Brazil).

• 43 goals, 33 assists (4th most assists) so 76 G/A in 80 Champions League games.

• First ever player to score 20 goals for two different clubs in the Champions League.

• 3rd most MOTM awards since 2009.

• 2nd most completed dribbles since 2009 in Europe (he came in the 13/14 season). 

• 20 free kick goals, 21 hat tricks. 

• 28 career trophies.

All this whilst being one of the best and most entertaining footballers. Not too bad of a resume eh? Injuries man.

"So Casemiro getting banned for a few games might be a minor blessing in disguise.

Just hear me out. An issue we have had since Fergie retired has been the dependence on individual player performances to get us the wins we need. That is always a double edged sword because naturally the team performance drops when these individuals are not playing well or not playing at all. This was rarely the same issue with Fergie since he managed to make a great number of mediocre players perform brilliantly as a collective. This is what I dream of ETH rebuilding.

Obviously, Casemiro had been instrumental to our midfield stability this season, along with Eriksen and Fernandes, but him out for a few games might create the opportunity for us to build a different form of midfield stability without what is arguably the best DM in the world. It's great that we have him, but it's dangerous if our whole play crumbles without him. We need that squad stability that gives confidence and trust in rotating the squad to prevent fatigue.

we played so much better.""

"I know it's beaten to death, but whatever. I like De Gea a lot, he is a legend, but I think we should be moving on from him and if we extend him, then his starting spot shouldn't be guaranteed.

However, I would like to ask people who think he should continue being our number 1, do you really think he is good enough on the ball? I know he is somewhat doing the job right now, but Ten Hag had to sacrifice some parts of our game to accomodate him.

We have had 156 goal kicks in the Prem this season and Martinez has taken 58 of them, that's around a third of all goal kicks we had (De Gea himself with 94). That's a crazy number and it's quite a clear indication Ten Hag doesn't trust De Gea under pressure. You won't find such high number anywhere else, the second highest number of goal kicks taken by an outfielder is Gabriel from Arsenal at 14.

In comparison, Man City outfielders have taken 5 goal kicks for Ederson while he himself took 92. 

De Gea's passing doesn't seem to be a problem often because Ten Hag doesn't allow him to get into risky positions with the ball. That's not a good thing though, a good passer could play through the risk and get us a big advantage 9 times out of 10. For now, De Gea is fine because we are still getting used to possession and controlling matches, but in the long run it's not ideal to build up with your CB taking a whole third of your goal kicks if he could be positioned higher up the pitch to receive the pass instead.",Manchester United,No,j7c3tp7,t3_10u5d5h

Liverpool - signed Alison won the league
City - Signed Ederson became centurions 
Milan - Signed maignan ended a 10 year wait for the league 
Arsenal - signed Ramsdale look to be on course to win the league.

I think part of it has to do with many old school fans on this subreddit, who view goalkeeping as being primarily shotstopping, everything else comes next. But this isn’t true, preventing shots is just as important as making a save.

It could be a club like Everton, who still have a name but will go for a fraction of the price… just saying, it’s possible. 

This season has been enjoyable for us, but the competition is better than ever, and we are a couple injuries away from crisis imo. We will see how we look without Casemiro, but I worry where the goals come from is god forbid Rashford or Bruno go down long term.

"We are in a great spot right now compared to previous years, but I just cannot shake this idea that the Weghorst experiment caused a confusion in our attack for the Palace and Arsenal games, games which I if we won we'd be in a serious title race right now.

I know we have to use PERSPECTIVE, where we have come from, but the difference in performance when Martial came on towards the end of the palace game was levels different. This is simply because Bruno is 3 times the player with 3 fast forwards in front of him. 

I honestly worry about Weghorst not being able to fit in our side simply because he is not fast enough to keep up with the play.

Weghorsts first chance vs Palace came with a very nice through ball from Bruno, a ball played well, that Weghorst was not able to get on the end of simply due to pace, he's quite slow.

People wont like this, but these performances he's putting in are frankly like playing with 10 men, or just no striker.

Both have tried to refresh with a shift to traditional CF which hasn't really worked for either (sure haaland is scoring an absolute shittonne of goals but city are not controlling games to same extent with a CF that is largely a passenger in the buildup)

I realise when EtH was in the press conference talking about how he was pleased the players were defending each other but that Casemiro had ""crossed a line"" he was basing that on the same misleading angle that we all saw, but think about it from Casemiro's point of view, if my boss jumped to the conclusion that I'd done something wrong when I hadn't, and my boss didn't apologise or make amends, I'd be furious with him/her.

I think EtH is smart enough to tell Casemiro that he shouldn't have said what he did, but you never know, some people can forget to clear the air, or assume it is a given that everything will be okay, and shit like that can fester and cause bad blood.

On a second note... fucking VAR.  Absolute incompetent, unjust, blind, dirty, moronic bunch of buffoons.  It's amazing on a day where we collect 3 points, Liverpool get whooped, Arsenal lose, Newcastle and Chelsea drop points, that I can still feel angry.  Bastards!!!

Lindelof CDM ... dont forget XD,Manchester United,Yes,j7ax00k,t1_j7aw5st
"If City get a win and a draw from arsenal (or two draws) we could be back in the race if we keep up our form.

A win against arsenal would have put us right up there, but there's still an outside chance with half a season of football to go. Let's allow ourselves to dream for another couple of weeks.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ce7vu,t1_j7c84qe
Would much rather arsenal win it than city,Manchester United,Yes,j7c8d2n,t1_j7c84qe
things we like to see,Manchester United,Yes,j7cyaeg,t1_j7cwqie
According to Madrid fans he is at his very best on the biggest European nights,Manchester United,Yes,j7a310x,t1_j7a2jze
I forgot a hatred of Barca would be in his blood... Cannot wait to see him play them,Manchester United,Yes,j7a6nn8,t1_j7a2jze
"It’s a good thing with this red card because I think he won’t have rested much at all without it. He may not need it but it’s always good to have some rest to keep players fresh and sharper than without I think. 

Hope Bruno gets subbed out in games too and we lead comfortably by 60 min.",Manchester United,Yes,j7a9bmq,t1_j7a2jze
"he really thrives when he’s asked to be a rotational, energising piece in our midfield, rather than having to constantly shoulder the burden of our midfield.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ac211,t1_j7aacaa
I mean we've been doing that pretty constantly this season and i love it.,Manchester United,Yes,j7a7o7d,t1_j7a3gw4
Precisely the opposite of Garnacho who plays for the team.,Manchester United,Yes,j7beg6m,t1_j7bcp5k
There were a couple of attitude issues. The incident with England when breaking covid rules and I remember Ole having an issue with him staying up late on his Xbox or something.,Manchester United,Yes,j7bo91k,t1_j7bcp5k
I think Ole and Southgate knew more about Greenwood’s issues than they revealed. Withdrawing him from England seemed strange considering the reason given for withdrawal.,Manchester United,Yes,j7burt2,t1_j7bcp5k
Rather Tottenham lost or drew we can think about city when top 4 is beyond doubt.,Manchester United,Yes,j7c25n1,t1_j7c1n4f
"It’s mental how well ETH has done so quickly, he was my top choice back when the Ole era was clearly over but I never thought we’d be playing so well this soon into season 1, winning a cup and finishing top 4 would be an unreal achievement",Manchester United,Yes,j7cf1z6,t1_j7ca86t
"For sure. It’s not his fault. He’s working hard to be fit and even tried to play while not as sharp as he wants to play and believes in the team and all. 

He’s just not reliable and it’s sad when players succumb to injury issues. We do need to move on from him unfortunately. 

I don’t at all fault players who are injury prone and try anyway. Just very unfortunate.",Manchester United,Yes,j7a92od,t1_j7a4jzj
"this ! it’s not like he wishes to be injured, poor man cannot get a break from injury… and the fans.",Manchester United,Yes,j7a4x29,t1_j7a4jzj
"This is an average City team (by their recent standards) whose weaknesses have been masked by the brilliance of Haaland.

Still a dangerous team who can beat anyone on their day, but also very much beatable themselves.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bsdp2,t1_j7bqoqd
They went all in on Haaland & he's made then easier to play against,Manchester United,Yes,j7bugrb,t1_j7bqoqd
r/soccer mods seem a bit too sensitive and trigger-happy which tbf seems to be pretty common on reddit,Manchester United,Yes,j7bszqq,t1_j7bs6kf
I feel like his tinkering has cost them at least 1 CL (final Vs Chelsea where he inexplicably decided not to play a holding midfielder),Manchester United,Yes,j7c89ot,t1_j7c6y5p
"They might, or they might experience a drop in form that gives other teams an opportunity. We just need to concentrate on our own games and see what happens.",Manchester United,Yes,j7cq6y6,t1_j7cofqk
"No chance they sack him this season unless he loses every single game and loses the dressing room. He's earnt the right to fuck most of these players off and rebuild. 

If he's shit *next* season it's probably time for him to walk.",Manchester United,Yes,j7awifo,t1_j7av9rc
"No matter how much goodwill a manager has, they can be sacked.

The fans and also the players will determine that. Usually if the players stop putting the hard yards in then there’s no way back. I’m not saying that’s the case yet, but there’s definitely a way for any manager to be sacked especially these days.",Manchester United,Yes,j7awmot,t1_j7av9rc
"Yeah but who can they get to come in after Klopp is the bigger question, can they afford that sort of upheaval?

Not that I care but from their perspective there's no one available that can improve the results, it is likely he'll stay put and write off this season and focus on the next one.",Manchester United,Yes,j7axch8,t1_j7av9rc
"7 goals conceded because of Kounde, Araujo, Christensen (who were all injured for the CL). Wouldn't have high hopes",Manchester United,Yes,j7cz501,t1_j7cy1gc
Its that southern European/south american mentality. These guys play for each other,Manchester United,Yes,j7aehav,t1_j7ae643
"The more people try to meme him for him “claiming” it, the more it becomes his. Some of the banter is funny, but the people getting genuinely wound up over it is a bit weird. Besides, it’s obviously not new, but he also does the head point in a specific way.",Manchester United,Yes,j7as28d,t1_j7arts3
"When did he first adopt the celebration? Does it coincide with him going on an absolute tear of scoring?

In my head the first time he did it was after getting dropped for being late to a team meetings which wasn't quite at the start of his goalscoring run",Manchester United,Yes,j7atnjk,t1_j7arts3
Ironically 1 in 7's their win rate,Manchester United,Yes,j7axspl,t1_j7auq4x
"With ETH, I look at Leeds as guaranteed 3 points no matter who is in the starting XI",Manchester United,Yes,j7bl5cc,t1_j7beum7
Dalot was in my top 3 before he got injured in the World Cup. Varane has to be mentioned too,Manchester United,Yes,j7d120g,t1_j7d0cdx
"My favourite Klopp stat is his European final form for Liverpool: 1 win, 3 losses. The supposed best team in history has reached 4 finals and lost 75% of them.",Manchester United,Yes,j7agf4f,t1_j7a3hgx
"The Liverpool era over with a prem, champs league and fa cup. We did that in 10 days in 1999",Manchester United,Yes,j7atdbe,t1_j7a3hgx
"""Verse 10th"" got me lmaooo",Manchester United,Yes,j7a804l,t1_j7a3hgx
"I don’t think Sancho has enough match fitness, but I think he’s coming on the second half.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b36zf,t1_j7b2qch
For the inevitable price he'll cost I genuinely think we could probably be able to get Kane or Vlahovic AND a young prospect to offer a different profile/backup,Manchester United,Yes,j7b98aq,t1_j7b66kv
Could also go for vlahovic if he's available. Always good to have options.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b6x95,t1_j7b66kv
"Everyone keeps saying this but I simply don't see it. Even ETH said he crossed the line.  Maybe they would reduce the 3 match ban, but it's still a red",Manchester United,Yes,j7blgks,t1_j7b6ywq
If City do the double against Arsenal things get really interesting,Manchester United,Yes,j7c4yl0,t1_j7c3el2
I'd argue we could sneak 1st in the last few days of the season if Arsenal drop more points and we keep winning. City will drop points too.,Manchester United,Yes,j7c5t27,t1_j7c3el2
Yea this happens   Players are just burnout so is Pep     Just shows you how SAF is the goat,Manchester United,Yes,j7c77x4,t1_j7c5qyk
Iconic,Manchester United,Yes,j7a7pnj,t1_j7a440x
I don’t get it? Disallowed goal or?,Manchester United,Yes,j7a94tx,t1_j7a440x
No surprises. We are the biggest club in the world.,Manchester United,Yes,j7as88z,t1_j7as0yl
"He didn’t want specifically Ajax players, just winners. He knew Antony and Martinez were winners having managed them for a few years. The added benefit is that they filled two positions we needed filled. They also know what sort of football Ten Hag wants to play, so having them is beneficial in a lot of ways.",Manchester United,Yes,j7c89pz,t1_j7c7j4i
"He like players with tenacity if we see his signing mostly it's player with desire to win, I like the sabitzer signing not watch him very much in bayern but when in leipzig he is amazing very hard working midfielder and maybe ETH realize if we go against team with high intensity it's almost useless using eriksen so he need anothee option...",Manchester United,Yes,j7c9oko,t1_j7c7j4i
🤝🏻 Hate them too,Manchester United,Yes,j7clbud,t1_j7ckk4c
"Got 1 game suspension of Casemiro last time, now 3 game suspension.",Manchester United,Yes,j7cr6o1,t1_j7ckk4c
"Hoping for their relegation in the near future. I'll always hate that prick Olise for scoring that free kick against us. Yeah it was a good goal, but please, try to reproduce it again when you play against City, Liverpool, Spurs, Newcastle, Arsenal etc. I'm bettin you won't.

(Yes the salt is real and I know I'm being unreasonable).",Manchester United,Yes,j7dggwe,t1_j7ckk4c
It is a pretty cool former venue in London https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Crystal\_Palace,Manchester United,Yes,j7covqq,t1_j7ckk4c
Yeah they love case so much,Manchester United,Yes,j7a5rd4,t1_j7a4o55
He’s be more expensive than Kane. Napoli are no pushovers,Manchester United,Yes,j7b583n,t1_j7az6yq
P - is for played. If anyone else having a bit of a brain fart like me,Manchester United,Yes,j7c69iu,t1_j7c5ltc
Very promising that we're 2/3 way done with this. Tough away games to come of course at places like Anfield but should hopefully make for a decent run in to end the season strong,Manchester United,Yes,j7c60ya,t1_j7c5ltc
"I never felt bad “rooting” for Man City to be honest. Whenever they play Liverpool, I always want Man City to win. They’re a fake soulless club without fans - wanting them to win doesn’t feel wrong. I just don’t care about them and neither do their own fans lol.

I hope they smash Spurs. We need to get as big of a Cushion in the top 4 as possible. 

Spurs are probably gonna win now - they bottle it when I want them to win and win when I want them to lose.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b52py,t1_j7b2efw
"Barca don’t have Dembele or busquets for both legs, their 100% beatable man they crumble under pressure",Manchester United,Yes,j7d3wvg,t1_j7d06y2
EL takes the life out of you with the travel and fixture congestion. Mourinho had to throw the league away to win it. Ole suffered massively due to fatigue in the final.,Manchester United,Yes,j7d6qtq,t1_j7d06y2
No chance we could beat Barca and its better if we can focus on Prem and Fa cup.,Manchester United,Yes,j7d2jlz,t1_j7d06y2
"I 100% agree. It’s possible that EL tests the limits of the squad in both PL and EL and we end up missing out in both. 

Some will argue it’s a second chance at CL football but our league position is decent. If we weren’t in both cups and weren’t playing every 3 days since forever we’d obviously all think otherwise.",Manchester United,Yes,j7d3ggs,t1_j7d06y2
"I think it's a reasonable take. 

My view is that I'll always support the club in every match they play but IF we were to get knocked out of the EL then I wouldn't dwell on it either. Yes I'd be disappointed but I'd move past it relatively quickly.",Manchester United,Yes,j7dfzcd,t1_j7d06y2
Agree. Obviously want to beat Barca just for the pride but if we're gonna win the Europa League then it's another 9 games all over Europe for a competition I haven't even thought about for months. Hopefully our league form means we don't need it for CL qualification.,Manchester United,Yes,j7dm0jg,t1_j7d06y2
First thing that came to my mind too. That should’ve been a red too but I’m happy with how that turned out,Manchester United,Yes,j7aswqo,t1_j7arnvd
He was calling ETH’s head after the first 2 games. He is a dumb mf,Manchester United,Yes,j7aywmp,t1_j7ayofb
City losing points will actually lift our players much. Always go for teams above you to loss points to gain moment. This league is taken game by game. Being 3 points behind city is massive,Manchester United,Yes,j7bwncd,t1_j7bv68e
Eriksen is a temporary fix who would ideally be a rotation option himself and I strongly doubt ETH wants his replacement to be the same profile. De Jong his ideal type of midfielder and I’d be looking on some similar and realistic midfielders of Frenkie profile. Barella comes to mind first,Manchester United,Yes,j7aeyii,t1_j7aeaim
"I think we were looking at Neves, championship side not idea. But I do have a suggestion on a Casemiro understudy or rather replacement. I watched the whole Chelsea vs Fulham match, I really liked Palhinha, he looked reckless albeit very similar and high intensity with Case. He did tackles in the right places (which he seems to use as his main ball winning trick) he had positioning, pressure and good anticipation as well.

Maybe was a 1 game thing but idk...felt very instinctive",Manchester United,Yes,j7af05z,t1_j7aeaim
"I've always felt JWP would do well as Erisken's replacement. If Southampton get relegated, we should try to get him",Manchester United,Yes,j7af83n,t1_j7aeaim
Would a player like Enzo Le Fee fit?,Manchester United,Yes,j7afido,t1_j7aeaim
"There's this kid called Garner, oh never mind.",Manchester United,Yes,j7anbpg,t1_j7aeaim
"I disagree, if we beat them, they’ll be less confident the next game",Manchester United,Yes,j7at3b3,t1_j7aql5z
"The Match of the Day angle from last night is probably the best one, and further illustrates that it wasn't nearly as bad as it first looks.",Manchester United,Yes,j7avgec,t1_j7audoi
"Unfortunately raising your hands to a players face or neck is always going to give them grounds to maintain their decision. Raising your hands isn’t always a red card offence, but to overturn one that was given in that scenario would be difficult. They’ll also argue about precedent setting and all that crap.

Ultimately it just shines a light on how shitty some of the arbitrary rules are. They should be able to retrospectively review the ban, as clearly missing 3 games for that is nonsensical. Much like the rule that if you get a yellow you escape retrospective action is dumb too, as Fabinho was able to escape punishment for hacking down a player with his studs up last week. 

Also….  VAR being able to show the ref a loop of one distant angle is proper fucking weird and incompetent. Instead of showing further context it just distorts it to show the VARs own context and agenda.",Manchester United,Yes,j7av441,t1_j7audoi
"The club will not appeal, imo. Casemiro clearly has his hands over Will Hughes' neck. If the appeal fails then Casemiro is suspended for an additional game I believe.",Manchester United,Yes,j7aurda,t1_j7audoi
"Is there any precedent for opposition players supporting a red card appeal? Will Hughes didn't look particular mad about the 'violent conduct' and they were even hugging it out a couple seconds later and some angles it looks more like casemiro is pulling him away from the main shoving match

Ultimately most of the angles are somewhat subjective. Some support the opinion that it's violent conduct and red card, others look like he is more restraining Hughes and will Hughes / casemiro are the only ones that really knows what the contact and intent was

Wonder is there any precedent or has an opposition player ever supported an appeal with a signed statement or similar that they didn't feel at the time there was any violent conduct and the red card was unjust

Maybe if Hughes sees some injustice in the red, neither him nor his club stand to gain anything from casemiro missing games, he could be a key witness here! Not that I think this will happen, I'm just curious if there is any precedent for opposition player supporting a red card appeal against a violent conduct charge",Manchester United,Yes,j7az7de,t1_j7audoi
"Short answer is yes.

Long answer is yeeeeeeeeees.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b119b,t1_j7b0hso
We would be absolutely unstoppable if we add Kane to this team,Manchester United,Yes,j7b2hb5,t1_j7b0hso
"Because there's only 2, maybe 3, others in the world like that?",Manchester United,Yes,j7bqbx0,t1_j7bq4jv
Pointing out the obvious a bit there.,Manchester United,Yes,j7byje6,t1_j7bq4jv
"I may be an optimist, but I like the idea of city dropping points. I feel like finishing second is doable",Manchester United,Yes,j7c2rs6,t1_j7c2023
Pep with his signature overthinking,Manchester United,Yes,j7clhtc,t1_j7cg5z2
"He is very good, kinda like that the media isn’t putting the world on his shoulders just yet though, hope we can lock him down and let him develop without mad pressure",Manchester United,Yes,j7b7ixu,t1_j7b62b7
"Knowing our bad luck + their scummy luck, they will get a bullshit offiside goal because there are not enough cameras at Anfield to provide evidence for VAR even though it;s visible to naked eye from International Space Station, and we would have to work hard for an equalizer, all this while Thiago will keep rolling on the floor after each misplaced pass so they will keep getting the possession back.",Manchester United,Yes,j7anpc8,t1_j7al28g
"Not going to happen. It's at Anfield. The last we beat Liverpool by more than one goal at Anfield, Spice Girls were at their peak.",Manchester United,Yes,j7andx3,t1_j7al28g
All I care about is 3 points. They arnt a top 4 rival. Its just another game to win.,Manchester United,Yes,j7amc1y,t1_j7al28g
"It would be nice, but it's all about us. Get into the top 4 and finish 20 points ahead of them would be better for me and beat them by a goal",Manchester United,Yes,j7am0tz,t1_j7al28g
I was one of those who didn't want him but you can't judge players like Gakpo and Nunez based on their first season in the most dysfunctional team in the league. I'd prefer they flop ofc.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b146w,t1_j7az8rd
"Gakpo might come good but physically he doesn't look like he has the tools to be a top tier striker, really slow whenever I've watched him.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b3z7s,t1_j7az8rd
"Was worried when we got linked to Nunez for mega money, was even more worried when we were looking at spending a big chunk of our limited money on Gakpo.

I was ecstatic when they got snapped up by someone else. Even better that it's Liverpool.

They're both just not good enough with a football.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b99d2,t1_j7az8rd
It was always going to be a transition season regardless of whether we took a long time to build a proper setup that was serviceable or if we overdeliver as we currently are doing though.,Manchester United,Yes,j7a8jla,t1_j7a7sks
https://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/10udrrb/sunday_pl_watch_nfo_vs_lee_1400_tot_vs_mci_1630/,Manchester United,Yes,j7bw1bk,t1_j7bos7g
The frustrating thing is that if we hadn't had such a shitty start we'd be right up in it,Manchester United,Yes,j7auh8b,t1_j7atsvb
"Honestly, I think our midfield is too light in depth and we are a top CF short

Defensively we look great and have good depth, our starting midfielders and attackers are probably good enough when on form but martial is so unreliable, antony not yet consistent enough and we are a casimiro, Bruno or rashford injury away from being massively weakened

I think this year is too soon for this group of players but that shouldn't take away from a season of great progress on the pitch and if ETH is backed in the summer and strengthens a couple of key positions plus adds depth then we can be a real threat next year

It's clear we are moving in n the right direction",Manchester United,Yes,j7aulfi,t1_j7atsvb
"Nah, we would have to have a flawless run, that's not going to happen with us still in four competitions and still raw in a few areas. An injury to Rashford or Bruno and its over. Martial being made of glass also doesnt help.",Manchester United,Yes,j7au9el,t1_j7atsvb
If we sign a top striker in the summer we will be in title contention next season imo,Manchester United,Yes,j7avyvm,t1_j7atsvb
This season? Nope,Manchester United,Yes,j7ay2o2,t1_j7atsvb
We're gonna need Arsenal and City to drop a lot more points that we are not gonna concede. Focusing on top 4 doesn't get your heart broken but I too have a small glimmer of hope. Its not every season Chelsea and Liverpool are a shadow of themselves.,Manchester United,Yes,j7au4j8,t1_j7atsvb
We just don't score enough.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b0hzr,t1_j7atsvb
"Deffo underachieved given career path and trajectory in 2016/17, PSG ain't the place for him, had he continued at Barcelona or anywhere else, imo Balon d'or for sure",Manchester United,Yes,j7azx4q,t1_j7ay7oq
"All those amazing stats and I still think he hasn't, and perhaps will never, reached his full potential.

The most talented since Messi IMO",Manchester United,Yes,j7aztur,t1_j7ay7oq
"Probably the 3rd best player of the last 15 years and in other era could have won at least 1 or possibly multiple balon d'ors

However he decided to take the ££ and play his prime years in french league which I think hurts his legacy a little. His resume reads like he should be in conversation as one of the greatest ever and not too many would make that argument about him

He has a skillset that should make him hugely popular, goals + assists machine, great dribbling and incredibly skillful but he isn't that well liked due to playacting / showboating etc and seemingly his inability to stay fit on his sister's birthday :)",Manchester United,Yes,j7azvhg,t1_j7ay7oq
"legacy-wise he shot himself in the foot by mpving to psg. Whether you like it or not, ligue 1 stats don't count for as much in most people's eyes with PSG farming that league like that",Manchester United,Yes,j7b02ra,t1_j7ay7oq
"On ability? Probably 3rd best this generation behind Ronaldo and Messi. Overall? I'd say 6th behind Neuer, Modric and Lewandowski also. Like you said, injuries have been an issue for a while which drops him down the pecking order.

He's played 169 games for them since joining in August 2017 (all comps) whilst Bruno (who joined us 2 1/2 years later) is close behind him on 158 games. The talent has always been there for him but injuries has left him missing the biggest occasions too many times.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b3152,t1_j7ay7oq
pretty ok for the past 5 seasons. when was the last time he hit 30 goals a season?,Manchester United,Yes,j7b0n8q,t1_j7ay7oq
He's insane but he went to play in the french league. Should have moved to the PL.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b0541,t1_j7ay7oq
"I’m fairly confident about Leeds. Shame McTominay isn’t there, weirdly he’s always good against Leeds!",Manchester United,Yes,j7c5y39,t1_j7c5adi
"this is why it's hilarious when people were saying we're in a title race AND when people laughed at us for not being in a title race  anymore. 

It's so early in the season, everything is still up in the balance",Manchester United,Yes,j7c5pvn,t1_j7c5adi
"We are dependent on arsenal going on a bit of a spell where they drop points

So far they haven't looked like they will do that however they need a big reaction after their first big setback of the season yesterday where they were heavy favourites to win and didn't perform

Their next game is massive (Brentford at the Emirates), of they don't get a bounce after Everton result and fail to win that one then it's 2 without a win going into man city game and the jitters may set in

But think realistically we are a bit too far back and squad probably isn't quite there yet with depth and the amount of games we have that we can make up such ground against a team that so far has been very consistent",Manchester United,Yes,j7c9958,t1_j7c6v1i
"If arsenal lost both games to city, we are in the race. Otherwise, we are just outsiders.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ceqne,t1_j7c6v1i
We have no clue on how to score them though.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b6mnc,t1_j7b5u4p
"Spurs will Spurs my man, nothing to worry about.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bzhwk,t1_j7bvcvy
"It will be good to see a bit more of Sabitzer I guess, made a decent cameo yesterday, and if Fergie can make Phil Neville, John O'Shea and Phil Jones look like half competent defensive midfielders then anything is possible!  

Thank goodness we got Sabitzer though, who I would assume is a bit more competent than the aforementioned names, although of course, I will reserve judgement till I've seen a bit more of him.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bdakh,t1_j7b8lpe
I get what you are saying but then whats going on in the games where he scores hat tricks for what looks like fun,Manchester United,Yes,j7cc7jm,t1_j7c5g89
"Christ, people need to stop with this Antony agenda",Manchester United,Yes,j7aflir,t1_j7af41u
"Imagine if we won the game vs Arsenal, we'd be in a serious title race rn",Manchester United,Yes,j7cm5uv,t1_j7cjw7w
I remember Real Madrid fans having similar complaints about Ruud Van Nistelrooy. They were annoyed that all he’d do is score goals.,Manchester United,Yes,j7cg4qz,t1_j7cc85q
"In fairness we were saying the same things about Ronaldo last season. From the outside, people look at stats and see he was individually successful but watching week in week out, you could see the team struggled to shoehorn Ronaldo, when forced to play to his strengths. 

City are in a similar position now with Haland and I don't think those comments are that crazy. He started off very strong but after a while, teams are able to stifle it out and City haven't been to adjust or find a different route.",Manchester United,Yes,j7chhba,t1_j7cc85q
They won’t have to worry too much. They’ll bottle the CL and he’ll be off to Madrid in a few years,Manchester United,Yes,j7d9oy9,t1_j7cc85q
Fucking hell. Joke of a club and a joke of a fanbase,Manchester United,Yes,j7ccx2y,t1_j7cc85q
"Don't want to agree with a city fan but he's right, we'll see how they look next year but it's clear at this point that Haaland and Pep aren't each others ideal pairing.",Manchester United,Yes,j7d6iva,t1_j7cc85q
"They paid his release clause, there was no “under the table” deals.",Manchester United,Yes,j7cgt1b,t1_j7cc85q
"Under the table? Thats not fair. Every transfer has addons, bonuses and agent fees.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ciaig,t1_j7cc85q
we don't have eriksen so this call will never be proven,Manchester United,Yes,j7apgf7,t1_j7aoieo
We already did under the GOAT,Manchester United,Yes,j7c53ul,t1_j7c47kn
"To be fair they are lol. Haaland is on pace to absolutey shatter the single season goalscoring record and De Bruyne is on pace to match or break the assist record (which he already shares with Henry).

"I’m a huge DDG fan, and I don’t think he should be sold, but I do think it’s time to get in a new GK. If he will accept a backup role, I hope he stays. 

My problem is the options people on here are suggesting we bring in. I’m not interested in Raya, Sanchez, or Sa ffs. Bring in a world class GK. Not an okay keeper. Not saying the aforementioned guys wouldn’t be a potential step up, but for the money, I’m interested in acquiring the next big name in the position.",Manchester United,Yes,j7c6gvp,t1_j7c3tp7
"City. 

1. Good for our top 4 chances
2. I hate Spurs and would like Kane to leave (for us ideally, or else abroad)

"City. Don’t get me wrong, I hate them, but we need top 4. It’s a must. Europa isn’t a given, so  whatever it takes to secure champions league football next season is all that matters and a City win today helps that cause tremendously. 

Also, I hate Arsenal and their arrogant fans. This lot isn’t shutting up about anything. Arsenal winning the title will make them even more insufferable than they are now. Would love to see them start to get really nervous with City breathing down their throats.",Manchester United,Yes,j7aw00d,t1_j7asgft

"If it's not obvious as a general rule I find draw is usually best

A win for spurs gives them massive confidence and something to really build momentum from, apart from very very specific scenarios I can never root for city so my rule of draw being best seems to hold true here for me at least",Manchester United,Yes,j7atwre,t1_j7asgft

We should call him back and start him instead of being stuck with DDG,Manchester United,Yes,j7b3vb8,t1_j7b1mk1
"The game vs Arsenal at the Emirates was the game it was the most evident that DDG wasn't going to cut for us if we want to challenge for the top trophies.

The difference between him and Ramsdale was staggering, the latter being able to put his team out of pressure by picking out passes that would completely go over our entire initial press, or would allow arsenal to move up the pitch quite easily. 

Meanwhile DDG would constantly make bad decisions of the pass, put the ball out for an arsenal throw-ins, launch it long to saliba-Gabriel and allow Arsenal to just absolutely lock us in our own half and have wave after wave after wave of attacks.

DDG is a legend of the club, and that fact will never change. But like Rooney, like Rio, like Vidic, like Evra, like Ronaldo, he's just not at the level anymore and moving him on will be the best for the team",Manchester United,Yes,j7anp66,t1_j7al6iz
Giving the example of Ramsdale is laughable,Manchester United,Yes,j7alqek,t1_j7al6iz
">I think it would be best if we got a new keeper this summer

Who is available on the market that is Ederson- or Alison-tier?",Manchester United,Yes,j7allty,t1_j7al6iz
We should stop this discussion altogether. You can never convince old school reds that De Gea is a net negative for us and has been for quite some time. We're winning most games so there's no room for criticism on this sub.,Manchester United,Yes,j7ali6s,t1_j7al6iz
"Your argument is definitely legit but if your point comes from the recent post about De Gea punching the ball away then is it a fair criticism?

Sure, the one in Arsenal match is bad, but this one is a curling ball to the far post from a free kick. In my view, it’s just a routine punch and people making a post to criticize him, if it’s not on the more level of hate, I’m not sure what is.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ao0rb,t1_j7al6iz
"The way i see it, is if we signed a keeper in 2018 and they played the exact same as de gea did over those 4/5 years then everyone here would be desperate to sell him, the only reason you want to keep a player shouldn't be because they were world class 4/5 years ago and have been poor since",Manchester United,Yes,j7ar22b,t1_j7al6iz
"I don't really want to argue this because I think the criticism towards De Gea is fine. He's a shotstopper and not much more than that and obviously the team could improve by replacing him. The thing that bothers me, though, is that after United wins 8 games in a row people instantly go to the match threads to complain about every little thing that went wrong. There's a time and place for it and some people are absolutely spamming criticism of him in February when there's just no way the club can do anything about it. Like, relax for a second and be happy the team is doing well. At some point it does become hatred. One user in particular has said it is literally his mission to convince everyone that De Gea has to go. It's ridiculous. 

Another thing I want to point out is that it is absurd to say there are old school fans here who don't appreciate a modern goalkeeper. The older fans are the ones who experienced players like Schmeichel and Van der Sar do everything a modern goalkeeper should do ages ago. Do you really think people didn't appreciate them and only cared about shot stopping? The concept of a modern goalkeeper wasn't invented in 2023. The rule changes in 1992 that keepers couldn't pick up passes from teammates is what led to the necessity of goalkeepers to play with their feet. Van der Sar started doing that shit 3 decades ago. Any older fan will have witnessed two CL wins with keepers like that being a huge factor. Newer fans like you should look up Schmeichel and how he came off his line and collected crosses. That's been a criticism of De Gea since day one and older fans obviously noticed that too.",Manchester United,Yes,j7avido,t1_j7al6iz
"Lots of 'good' goal scorers in lower Leagues, the gamble is if they are the real deal or not.",Manchester United,Yes,j7aaa4j,t1_j7aa65m
Kane is likely to leave Tottenham this summer and I think we'll go all out for him.,Manchester United,Yes,j7abu0f,t1_j7aa65m
I'd definitely take him for a few mill. Anything over £12M I'd be a bit put off though. But he's a great squad option and does well to create space for our other attackers.,Manchester United,Yes,j7ahd80,t1_j7aa65m
"Not sure why you're being downvoted, a  backup DM is a must in the summer. ETH obviously sees Fred in the Eriksen role and McTominay isn't good enough.",Manchester United,Yes,j7axpxd,t1_j7ax1jg
"Definitely, however I'd like to see how Sabitzer does on there. If he works out we may not have to go hunting for someone else",Manchester United,Yes,j7axyhw,t1_j7ax1jg
"We did sign Sabitzer because of Eriksen injury. 

Would love to see Sabitzer + Case combo

But true we do need a backup CDM next season in case Case got red card again",Manchester United,Yes,j7aygc0,t1_j7ax1jg
It's definitely needed but it's probably lower on the priority list compared to other positions,Manchester United,Yes,j7b1vu5,t1_j7ax1jg
"If Sabitzer proves himself then I wouldn't mind keeping him because he can play as all of CAM, CM and CDM quite well. Another option could be getting a young understudy to Casemiro. There is plenty of talented DMs in Ligue 1 so we could get one there.

I wouldn't mind promoting someone from our academy but I don't really see a DM there. Iqbal and Mainoo are midfielders that play deep, but I wouldn't call them DMs. Iqbal is a ball-carrier and seems somewhat similar to De Jong in playstyle while Mainoo has some of those Pogba attributes (some good, some not so good).",Manchester United,Yes,j7bk62z,t1_j7ax1jg

"One thing I've noticed about really good managers is that they are able to spot when players start diminishing on a performance level and act first, something you could argue we have NOT done over the course of the last decade. 

You don't always have to make a 10 year investment on a player, spotting when a player comes into their 3-4 year 'prime period' is what great managers do. And in turn move them on when they stop offering that.  This isn't true with Eriksen and Cass, however in signing these players he has demonstrated he has an awareness of what we were NOT doing. Something which the general fan struggles to see. 

The football performance comes first, which is why everyone loves this guy, he knows ball, properly gets football. Understands movement or lack of, understands why we lost, the specific reasons as opposed to a general mentality statement. 

Basically what I'm saying is, ETH will sort it, he has a great eye for the levels of the game and which one we are currently under.",Manchester United,Yes,j7cny60,t1_j7cghbf
"Yeah wish we were in the timeline in which they got ronaldo and we would have a shot at getting him. But oh well, everything turned out good now, cant wish for more with how the past few years have gone.",Manchester United,Yes,j7buuxl,t1_j7bt4h9
What about Osimhen and Bellingham? It'll cost an arm and a leg but then in theory our spine will be set for 5 years or more. Rice is also on the move. Why are top strikers in such short supply nowadays?,Manchester United,Yes,j7bxj7n,t1_j7bwi1d

"The eye opening stat (which Carragher among others have mentioned) is that they’ve scored the same amount of goals as last season, even with Haaland getting 25+. 

It’s just that they’re all going through him and as you said, the tactic becomes give to to Haaland and if that doesn’t work they’re low on ideas. 

It feels strange to say that about a Pep team, but then again he’s never been the most endearing towards target man number 9s.",Manchester United,Yes,j7d3x7d,t1_j7d1h6l
"There’s more to Man City’s apparent demise. Too many changes. Pep is at his best when he fields as many midfielders as possible. 

It’s hard enough for a Pep team to play one striker let alone two strikers plus two wingers. Also, Ikanji and Ake are playing way too much. On talent, those should be his 4th and 5th choice central defenders.

Anyway, long may they suffer…",Manchester United,Yes,j7d72wj,t1_j7d1h6l
"Really? I felt its the lack of service.

"Feel like ETH has a clear preference for right footed RCB and left footed LCB given his use of Shaw on the left at times even when we had established CBs available for the bench so in that sense our CB options are a bit imbalanced

Of our 1st team options varane, Maguire, lindelof are all right footed so I think if 1 or Maguire (most likely) or lindelof move on we will possibly try to replace with a left footer that can provide competition / backup for licha

I have used transfermarkt to help filter for leftfooted centre backs...

Bastoni / gvardiol would be the rolls Royce options, but they are likely off limits as a backup/competition/ development option

Feel like badiashile, botman, schlotterbeck would all have been great options but it's too late for those by virtue of moving clubs this season and current clubs wouldn't sell

Maybe someone like ndicka but he has expiring contract so there will be alot of competition from Europes top clubs, or hincapie from leverkusen fit the bill of quality left footed centrebacks that with some development could be elite and we have been linked with him in the past too

I wouldn't really blame him for either of those matches.

"Yet another Neves, Maddison, Ward-Prowse, Tielemans, etc. People constantly pushing for them in spite of the fact we would be spending starting XI level money on only guaranteed squad players.",Manchester United,Yes,j7biby5,t1_j7ben6i
"Better value than Rice? Yes, but not better value than Bellingham. Bellingham is a crazy good talent and he is still only 19.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bgpom,t1_j7ben6i

People aren’t that petty. They probably need to talk to him first. Don’t need to burn bridges you know,Manchester United,Yes,j7abvr7,t1_j7ab81o
He's still the most popular footballer on the planet so I give them a pass,Manchester United,Yes,j7ac1cg,t1_j7ab81o

"And he's having a better season than Klopp and, with the squad he's got versus City's (and the amount of time he has been here versus the years Pep has been there), you could argue he's having a better season than Pep.

Arteta is obviously doing well at Arsenal, probably over-performing for what they have but I do believe it'll all come crashing down the next couple of months. Conte deserves a mention as a top manager too but he's obviously underperforming with Spurs at the moment. 

Can't wait to see what ETH's team looks like in 2/3 years.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ab5j2,t1_j7aaujx
He's better than Klopp,Manchester United,Yes,j7ab8iv,t1_j7aaujx
"He has a little bit of experience at a decent level, I think he'll be just fine",Manchester United,Yes,j7bsaop,t1_j7bqfeb

Greenwood and Harriet follow each other as well. was pretty sure Greenwood was not following Harriet a month ago.,Manchester United,Yes,j7cuane,t1_j7ctdym
"City win increases the pressure on Arsenal who will speed up them bottling it. Pep will overcomplicate City’s run-in leaving a clear path for us to win.

"No way man

Top 4 is in the balance, we don't want spurs getting any ideas",Manchester United,Yes,j7b3k1m,t1_j7azq7n
A draw would be my preferred result.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b06x0,t1_j7azq7n
I’d prefer city to win I think. It gives us more security in the top 4 and City gets closer to Arsenal who I’d really enjoy seeing fumble the league title.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b01n1,t1_j7azq7n
I would rather city win and hope for assna confidence to wreck into eternity,Manchester United,Yes,j7b28t5,t1_j7azq7n
Our priority should be top 4 this season imo. That was the best we could have hoped for before it started. Wouldn’t mind city getting the result today to strengthen our top 4 chances,Manchester United,Yes,j7b1ope,t1_j7azq7n
There's no title challenge. We aren't there yet forget about it. Squad's too thin. Let's just go get top 4,Manchester United,Yes,j7b1qg5,t1_j7azq7n
"nope. doesn't owe him shit cos even casemiro knows what he did is wrong. saying casemiro ""crossed a line"" is the same as saying he went too far. what's wrong in your manager telling you that?(didn't even tell him to his face)",Manchester United,Yes,j7au1bz,t1_j7ato2z
"We all agree it was a blunder from the ref but at the end of the day you dont put your hand around the neck area or grabbing someone by the collar, whatever the intention is. Those areas should be off limit for any sort contact especially during a scuffle. Visually, Casemiro just gave the ref free ammo. A player as experienced as Casemiro should know better. He couldve just hug Hughes if he wanted to restraint him. It is what it is. Another important lesson learn.",Manchester United,Yes,j7av6sj,t1_j7ato2z
"In fairness, he said “*when you freeze the moment he’s crossing the line”* so imo there is room for him to elaborate and change his opinion on that. 

I’m thinking that he generally means “it looks bad in the images we saw”. 

But yeah, I’m sure once the videos and angles have got back to the him and the club they’ll feel slightly differently like all of us. Not that it’s going to get overturned or anything, but it’s just a really unfortunate way that he held his shirt and wasn’t anywhere near as malicious as the pictures looked.",Manchester United,Yes,j7atzog,t1_j7ato2z
"If Antony didnt sign for manchester united, this brawl wouldn't happen at all.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b2g6k,t1_j7b0sx0
Can't blame Antony for casemiros stupidity.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b2h86,t1_j7b0sx0
I agree. Antony thinks he's hard. It's kinda hilarious,Manchester United,Yes,j7b7x38,t1_j7b0sx0
"Sorry mate but if you haven’t seen the video/audios drom the “alleged” rapist, you should. Sadly in this day and age money always will win those cases. Also why are you mad people are optimistic?",Manchester United,Yes,j7d9qve,t1_j7btzyi
Last few transfers will tell you that the club is now better at keeping it quiet until final details of the deal are about to be done so no chance you get any credit links. Anything you see before we get new owners is just click bait,Manchester United,Yes,j7de68r,t1_j7dd5v6
"It’s rare we know what’s happening with transfers at this stage of the year, but it’s especially hard right now with the club up for sale. We have no idea what kind of transfer budget we might have.",Manchester United,Yes,j7de6qx,t1_j7dd5v6

Nah I appreciate them for that. Liverpool support is bad PR for the Glazers.,Manchester United,Yes,j7adv10,t1_j7a5peq
 Wait a second. I kind of like the way Liverpool is currently playing. I think he should keep on doing what he's doing,Manchester United,Yes,j7a65u2,t1_j7a5ms7
We all loved it when Young did it to Di Maria though.,Manchester United,Yes,j7d98l7,t1_j7aipei
"Good point. 

For all we know, Casemiro would have got a red in the next game, we lose and also lose him for the cup final.

At least that’s how my clutching at straws and trying to harness the butterfly effect brain is trying to justify it.",Manchester United,Yes,j7apd5l,t1_j7amtsm
Liverpool have yet to win a pl game in 2023. 😀,Manchester United,Yes,j7atqv5,t1_j7asrx2
they only recently got knocked out of the FA cup though no?,Manchester United,Yes,j7aeilp,t1_j7a7keu
"Indeed. I mean, objectively speaking, why the fuck do they not send off Ayew for the same thing? Why single out Casemiro? It’s really weird.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ams8h,t1_j7amnfz
I think it might be a second season DLC.,Manchester United,Yes,j7agn32,t1_j7afijz
He took a shot with his right foot last match,Manchester United,Yes,j7akxqp,t1_j7afijz
They could put some soft cushioning on match days perhaps for now if that could be something. But not for rainy days maybe so I’m not sure.,Manchester United,Yes,j7a8ncy,t1_j7a843a
"Yes, last season they would just give up, it was infuriating to watch.",Manchester United,Yes,j7aclwy,t1_j7acfqi
"The only thing about a comeback king mentality is that although it does show a good mentality to come back it also highlighted the Ole era inability to prepare properly for games, we spent a lot of matches starting badly and either not scoring or allowing other teams to score and then that set off a reaction. 

That team also played well every time ole was about to get the sack right up until the end. It was a sign of weak mentality I always thought as needing to have our backs to the wall to focus was never sustainable.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ae3z1,t1_j7acfqi
None of this would have happened if he booked a palace player early in the game instead of just letting them get away.,Manchester United,Yes,j7an4pc,t1_j7akeyi

Why?,Manchester United,Yes,j7ak2am,t1_j7a9q9o
Yea Bayern fans said he's tried to reinvent himself as a DM to play with Kimmich/Goretzka and did it quite well apparently,Manchester United,Yes,j7an15z,t1_j7alebl
"Not to worry too much. They're bringing in Laimer in the summer. He almost surely will leave. 
There was an interview on Stretford Paddock with a journalist from Germany who is very certain he will leave given he will be competing with Kimmich, Goretzka, Gravenberch, Musiala, Muller and Laimer.
If he does well here he thinks there's a strong chance we will do a deal with him.",Manchester United,Yes,j7arx1e,t1_j7aitpv
If he does well and wants to stay I’d say a permanent can be arranged,Manchester United,Yes,j7ardk4,t1_j7aitpv
"Yeah I noticed that too and was surprised a bit. In fact, he's actually seemingly becoming more alert in that regard. I know he did have that big switch off against Arsenal for their opener. But, I'm willing to give him benefit of doubt in that because he was in an unfamiliar left back role. As a right back, he's improving and becoming more alert to those back post crosses and hopefully keeps getting better like you say.",Manchester United,Yes,j7av3iy,t1_j7asfw3
Sabitzer cameo looks pretty good to me. He has the tenacity to make decisive tackles which is what Casemiro is very good at.,Manchester United,Yes,j7alnt1,t1_j7akaio
That is the City game,Manchester United,Yes,j7aruoa,t1_j7arjig
Against Man City tho.,Manchester United,Yes,j7aru9p,t1_j7arjig
"Think he'd be a great backup/rotation option for Varane, with the expectation of taking over eventually. 

He's absolutely rapid, loves defending, is aggressive, and super physical. He's not silkiest around, but neither is Varane. I think he'd be a great partner for Martinez over someone like Lindelof or Maguire.

We'd just need a left-footed younger, cheaper option (or an aging backup option, since Martinez hopefully has a long time left) and we'd have 4 quality CBs with a real succession plan in order.

Could get a bit of money in (or even just getting rid of their wages) for Maguire, Lindelof, Tuanzebe, Bailly, and Phil Jones, and be left in a much better position.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b8urw,t1_j7b5mdq
"Shouldn't be that big of an issue. If I'm not mistaken, City had some sort of clause on Sancho as well but they didn't activate it because they didn't feel the need to bring him in.

That's something that has to be respected about City, they act smart and use logic instead of emotions. Not like Woodward who overpaid on Sanchez, Fred and Maguire just because City wanted them too and we needed to show off our financial strength for no reason.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bj7b3,t1_j7bagj4
"How did you leave out Dembele? 

I think there is something up with the national team physio. They skip traditional recovery if it includes surgery for alternatives with a small chance of working out and it always backfires.

Add the Milan GK to the list. Initially out for a few weeks. Might make it to the WC squad still out now.",Manchester United,Yes,j7agmtj,t1_j7a6iz9
Made of cotton candy. Sweat makes them disolve,Manchester United,Yes,j7ac6o4,t1_j7a6iz9
He just does over the top laughing. Annoying. If I want comedy I'll turn over to LFCTV,Manchester United,Yes,j7cgy38,t1_j7cbv93
Haaland is not a focal point he's just a big guy. He makes good runs behind the defence every game but City are incapable of being direct.,Manchester United,Yes,j7cgx8u,t1_j7ca6e8
"Why must we always suffer?

First it was Liverpool or City.

Now it’s Arsenal or City. I’d rather City win it, simply because of the 2000s era.",Manchester United,Yes,j7c9er8,t1_j7c8d2n
"Hope he shakes down De Jong after scoring a hat trick, and goes ""thats for not joining us you cunt"".

Small ask, I know.",Manchester United,Yes,j7agepw,t1_j7a6nn8
100% accurate.  Can't be the main focus.  Doesn't have the skills necessary to be a focal point.  Solid player when he's playing a role and bringing the energy,Manchester United,Yes,j7accvh,t1_j7ac211
The Ten Hag Meth Machine Cooks On.,Manchester United,Yes,j7ag9w2,t1_j7a7o7d
"We're still three points ahead of Spurs with a game in-hand, so we've still got a nice bit of breathing space. I'm all for looking at what's above us now, rather than below us - City need to start watching their backs.",Manchester United,Yes,j7c3033,t1_j7c25n1
"I do hate when people make comments like this. As Ten Hag says, the aim is to win every game. That is the philosophy, it should not matter about those below only that we look up. We have taken 3rd from Newcastle, gained ground on both City and Arsenal with the potential to be second in two games time. Nothing we do can change what teams below us do, and if they beat those above us then even better.",Manchester United,Yes,j7c9clp,t1_j7c25n1
">It’s not his fault.

It’s absolutely a players fault if they get injured so often. It’s a sign they do not take their recovery as seriously as they should.",Manchester United,Yes,j7ag571,t1_j7a92od
"I agree with aero. It’s the same problem we were having with Ronaldo, a scorer, but nothing else.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bvgia,t1_j7bsdp2
"As if mods here werent the same

I got a 3 day ban on another account here for saying we should move on from de jong cause he didnt want to come in july. Apparently, having a new-ish and having such opinions means im a total troll....

Poch and Tuchel are available.,Manchester United,Yes,j7axldc,t1_j7axch8
"True. If we were ever gonna run into them in the EL, I’d rather they have their merry way with us now than later. 

I’d hit eject on the EL right now if I could. Only reason I want us to win is literally just for that winning momentum and confidence. Obviously a trophy would be nice too but the final is miles away.",Manchester United,Yes,j7d0ptx,t1_j7cz501
We don’t have any southern Europeans in the squad. Literally none.,Manchester United,Yes,j7agrim,t1_j7aehav
Did you see his Maupay and Zinchenko story on insta? Man’s absolutely milking it now and I love it,Manchester United,Yes,j7as5s3,t1_j7as28d

"Perfect game for him to build match fitness, isn't gonna happen unless he plays.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b3b8o,t1_j7b36zf
You get match fitness by playing matches.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b3n0f,t1_j7b36zf
"I hope he starts. Antony didn't play for weeks before he signed for united. Let's not forget he even refused to train with Ajax in order to push the move, but Ten Hag started him straight away against Arsenal",Manchester United,Yes,j7b6sp0,t1_j7b36zf
A city win over arsenal and then a draw really would be ideal,Manchester United,Yes,j7c5siv,t1_j7c4yl0
Wishful thinking but most of our big games are done thanks to the scheduling.,Manchester United,Yes,j7cbgt7,t1_j7c5t27
"There's an explanation below on that Twitter link.

Fuck schlupp that dirty piece of shit. A body slam like that with no intent to win the ball and that throws the player off the pitch like that should be a red card offense. How is something like that even allowed is just mind boggling.,Manchester United,Yes,j7d8bkn,t1_j7cr6o1
"Liverpool are dogshite, fancy us against them even with out congested schedule",Manchester United,Yes,j7c69kw,t1_j7c60ya

Why is he acting like he used to play for one of our rivals for? I swear the level of hate he has towards our club is senseless.,Manchester United,Yes,j7az3ns,t1_j7aywmp
He would be excellent for now but ideally we should be targeting someone younger.,Manchester United,Yes,j7agueq,t1_j7af83n
People are only talking about Le Fee because Stephen shows on apple about him in a video.,Manchester United,Yes,j7afnzn,t1_j7afido

"I don't think that's true. An extra game is only added for frivolous appeals whereas a) we have new evidence and b) stand to gain nothing from making a frivolous appeal.

Imagine if he broke Alan Shearer's record as a Man United player.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b1cqj,t1_j7b119b
Well Utd's standards are being one of the Top 3-5 clubs in the world. Just bcoz we havent been for a decade doesnt mean we dont try to get back up there.,Manchester United,Yes,j7bqtnv,t1_j7bqbx0

Where else could he have realistically gone to? It’s not like Barcelona have been this amazing team since he has left.,Manchester United,Yes,j7b0nr4,t1_j7azx4q
"He hasn’t at PSG because of injuries. His best goal scoring record is 28 goals in 30 games in 17/18 season, and this season he has 17 goals and 15 assists in 25 games.",Manchester United,Yes,j7b18xu,t1_j7b0n8q
"No other club was willing to pay that release clause. Either he stayed at Barcelona who have been on a downward spiral ever since he left, or he makes that move to PSG.

But will look on the bright side of any result tbh.",Manchester United,Yes,j7atch2,t1_j7asuum
"Agree with you… really depends which way you want to look at it.

"The bigger the gap between us and the teams behind us, the better. We've got a crowded schedule and we're going to drop points, here and there. I still think a trophy and top four would be an incredible season, given where we started.

"How did Cas go too far?  He had his hands on his shoulder, he wasn't throttling him like the VAR pictures were suggesting.  Eric ten Hag said in the very same press conference that he was happy his players were defending each other because you have to do that in those situations, so it sends a mixed message if you are saying Cas crossed a line, but at the same time you are ""supposed"" to defend your teammates.",Manchester United,Yes,j7auvyi,t1_j7au1bz
"Watch the Match of the Day angle from last night.  He had his hands on his shoulders, then as Hughes comes forward, the momentum from Hughes coming forward moves Casemiro's hands closer to his neck for a split second.

"It's not true you are right, extended suspension is for frivolous appeals I believe. Most likely outcome if we appeal is either it's upheld or overturned, extended seems very unlikely given some of the camera angles making it look very innocuous

HOWEVER and reason I think we will not appeal... it won't get heard immediately so if we appeal he is likely available for Leeds on Wednesday but then if the red card and 3 game ban is upheld he is out of league cup final as currently that would be his first game back

If we were guaranteed appeal would be adjudicated before the 1st Leeds game then appeal would be very reasonable as it seems is certainly not frivolous appeal and we could at least present a strong appeal with additional camera angles, but the risk of him missing league cup final for me is too big of a risk if the timeline of the appeal means it won't get adjudicated until after Leeds game",Manchester United,Yes,j7avo3o,t1_j7auvxc

Highly reliable Telegraph already said they want to buy Henderson in the summer permanently and he wants to stay as well. Navas is just there to cover for now. Not really an issue,Manchester United,Yes,j7b6ij2,t1_j7b6b8j
">Keylor Navas is the sort of goalkeeper Dean rates himself as highly as. With the key difference Navas is world class, and has only been benched at the world’s biggest clubs by keepers who are far better than Dean Henderson, and who would probably have been first choice over de gea if they were United keepers.

Let's not take things too far. Dean is a good keeper and he knows that. All he wanted was a fair chance of becoming our number 1 because De Gea certainly wasn't irreplaceable (and still isn't) but he didn't really get it, so he got frustrated. However, he has been very good for Nottingham Forest this season once they got their shit together.

Navas obviously had a great career and he is still good, but he is also 36. I don't think he is as good as he used to be and if Nottingham were to buy him, I think he'd be Henderson's backup.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bipx9,t1_j7b6b8j
Yea but Navas is only there because he's injured. And Forest want to buy him in the summer so he won't be worried about Navas much. Doesn't seem like a man who enjoys competition and doesn't seem like Forest will give him any long term. Good for all parties involved,Manchester United,Yes,j7b6o6q,t1_j7b5v5a
"De gea needs to leave the club for his betterment. Unless he is okay playing second choice from now on and reducing his wages to by more than 50%, I don't see why he should stay. And any sensible player won't accept that at all.

He is obviously not good enough for our ambitions.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bv24a,t1_j7bsdm6
"I mean he has his qualities , but he doesn’t fit a team that likes to progress the ball with short passes from the back

He’s a good defender for a team that relies on their CB’s to be stoppers and who’s primary goal is to clear danger instead of looking to play it from the back.

So yes he can go for 45mins and he’s honestly a good player but can’t play in a system that likes to dictate the game",Manchester United,Yes,j7d30mm,t1_j7d0ljn
"Trust me,if ETH thinks DDG is not good enough for the way he wants to play, he will definitely replace him without blinking an eye just like he has done with Maguire, McT n Ronaldo...on the other hand,if he feels DDG is serviceable, we will see playing again next season coz it will mean ETH is prioritising other areas of the team",Manchester United,Yes,j7ddj0h,t1_j7da736
And then goes onto sit on the bench.,Manchester United,Yes,j7bnubf,t1_j7blm0z
"That’s my point. You’d be spending 70mil (starting XI level money) on a squad player.

Going off last summers budget, that means spending 1/3 of it on someone who doesn’t improve your starting XI.

You may as well spend that or a little more and get someone who is good enough for the first team rather than wasting it on him.",Manchester United,Yes,j7bnhyo,t1_j7blm0z
"Yeah but he is a world class talent. Mac Allister for 70mil would be a better value than Rice (and a better fit) but I still think it isn't a great value because I don't see him as elite midfielder. Maybe he will prove me wrong, but I believe he is ""only"" a good midfielder and for 70mil, we could do better.

If we have new owners willing to splash the cash, then Bellingham is a no-brainer. Real Madrid are the only big competition I see for him because Liverpool has fallen apart while we seem to be capable of offering an interesting project.

We also don't need that many new players to take the next step. Raya for 15-20mil would be a cheap upgrade in goal, Bellingham would fit perfectly alongside Casemiro and Bruno to create one hell of a midfield and with our good wing depth, we could get away with a striker that's good, but not necessarily world class. Even if we were to go for someone world class though, Kane shouldn't be as expensive as usual because his contract is running out next year.

While Henderson is injured, Navas is going to start. It’ll be interesting once Henderson is available again whether the club bench Navas. If they don’t, it’ll be interesting to see his reaction.

"You argument has evolved a bit here from saying a GK is often the final link in building a title winning team to using arsenals improvement from 8th to 5th (and seemingly giving ramsdale the credit for that)

He is a good go and had improved arsenal, but I'd say there gradual improvement last season and more dramatic rise this year is the result of 3 seasons of solid squad building (getting rid of the older overpaid players) and building a core of young hungry players maturing well at the same time

Yes ramsdale improved them and fits their system well, but the emergence and improvements of saliba, martinelli, saka, odegaard, Gabriel, smith Rowe, nketiah and expensive signings like partey, white, zinchenko, Jesus have all been important too.

Fwiw I think we should be looking a different goalkeeper in the summer. De gea distribution has improved alot and his shotstopping is very strong but is still wince everytime I see him punch a cross that is easier to catch and these small details can cost us, I just think using ramsdale and arsenals epic rise from 8th to 5th after signing him as an example of why is massively flawed as that improvement came with many many other important changes to the squad",Manchester United,Yes,j7axk0p,t1_j7aop56

"No, I've never seen Navas before, tell me more.

Anyway, people tend to forget Henderson was fine being benched by de Gea in 2020-21. He got the place when de Gea went on paternity leave and did really well. Then he got covid and lost his place. That prompted his reaction. I have to say that's actually fair of him. Ole bottled that.

Either way, he's gone in the summer and he's someone else's problem. I'll happily take the money, let de Gea walk at the end of his contract, and upgrade to a new GK",Manchester United,Yes,j7bftvh,t1_j7bf9fe
"This is something I don't understand. He is ambitious, he wants to keep improving, he wants to become England's number 1 and he does have the talent for him. The club simply mistreated him and he got frustrated in the end. He doesn't think of himself as better than Neuer or whatever, but Ole wasted two years of his career by having him sit on the bench instead of playing somewhere else every match and improving.

His sense of entitlement comes from Ole literally telling him he would be his number 1 keeper. Did Ole deliver? No. Did Rangnick then deliver? Also no. So, Deano told the club he wanted to go out on loan in January last year but the answer was also no.

You mention it yourself, Ten Hag asked him about a return and he refused. Why? Well, that's fucking obvious, he wants to play. If he came back, he'd play maybe like 3 games until the season if he's lucky and in the meantime, he'd be sitting on the bench wasting his career.

The truth is, Deano is a good keeper. De Gea is also a good keeper. Better in some ways compared to Deano, worse in some others. Some might argue Deano is a better fit for us though. I think Deano isn't quite good enough to be an undisputed long term number 1 for us, but that changes nothing about the fact he is too good to just sit on the bench and play once a month in less important cup games. What's more important than his quality though is his age. A good old keeper is usually fine with sitting on the bench. Same can't be said for good young keepers who want to play and keep improving. Deano is 25, he can still get a lot better than he currently is but he needs to play regularly. Someone like Navas who is 36 doesn't need to play as much.

Do I mind us selling him? Not at all, but I also understand his frustration. He was on the rise, he kept improving year after year, he had like 3 straight promotions during his loans and he was among the best Prem keepers in his first full Prem season with Sheffield United when they were chasing Top6 straight after a promotion (and stats-wise he was much better than De Gea back then). Then we called him back and let him rot on the bench for 2 years.

"I do understand the frustration that could come with having an expectation based off a casual thoughtless promise made by a former manager. But I also expect him to be able to see that ten hag is running a meritocracy here. If it wasn’t obvious in June last year it should be obvious today. There are no sacred cows. So with this new context if he still holds a resentment over promises made by a manager 2 managers ago, and doesn’t have the actual skills to match his confidence then there’s really only just the one outcome left now. 

In fairness he’s probably in his mind done with the club and has genuinely wanted to use this last loan to demonstrate to his next club that he’s worthy of starting every week. I’ll be honest, that he’s found success at low-mid table clubs is probably good for him and I hope that’s where his ambitions remain. If he cannot unseat DDG with DDG’s obvious limitations he’d likely also rot on the bench at any club where there’s a solid competition between two very solid keepers. I think he’s solid. I think he thinks he’s better than that and there’s just no evidence to support that. None of this is about stats and evidence. All of it seems to be he’s done because he thinks the club has broken promises and he’s unwilling to see it any other way. 

As a matter of fact if Donnarumma sat on United’s bench for 5 years he’d look better than both DDG and Henderson. He is obviously good. I take issue that Henderson perhaps thinks that he’s that good and therefore needs to be made promises and those promises need to be kept. He thinks “show me on the training pitch” is irrelevant if “don’t worry Deano you’re my #1 I promise you” has been made. That’s absurdly naive. 

And yeah, it’s just one more stinkers of Ole’s shocking squad management. He was worse at squad management than I think Henderson is as a keeper and that’s the root cause of the resentment here unfortunately",Manchester United,Yes,j7c5nxy,t1_j7bo6kp

I checked the total minutes for club football in all competitions (fbref) - Tielemans has 32.7 k minutes in his almost 26 y.o. For comparison, Frenkie de Jong (the same age) has only 22.1k, McTominay - 12.7k, and Pogba (almost 30) - 31.3 k.

"I gave a look to the league table for the first time in forever and our goal difference is atrocious.

Goals against is skewed thanks to the early bet-shitting we did to start the season.  
But it was just wild to put two and two together to realize that Martial missing with injury and none of our RWers being goal threats has really shot us.  


Oh... and I just realized, I blanked on Ronaldo. He didn't contribute much and I'm pretty sure Fred and Case have more goals than him and probably did even before Ronaldo left.  


With that said, it's kinda egregious that the board didn't look to sign a long term solution of quality at ST. Let's be honest, Wout is a warm body and is nowehere near the level you'd expect from a key United player and doesn't even have the potential cause of age and this being a loan.

I think we rotate heavily in FA Cup against West Ham and if we lose, we lose it’s whatever. League Cup Final is most important at the moment, followed by Barca. As long as we get business done in our PL matches, Im not too worried there. After the dropped points against Arsenal/Palace, our short lived time in the title race has come to an end and I think we should be safe for Top 4. The games against Newcastle and Spurs will be big though 

Come April if we’re still in Europa and FA Cup, we start to prioritize the mickey mouse treble over a match against Forest or Everton. Some form of silverware is needed for this squad this year.

"Y'all are saying Casemiro grabbed Hughes by the neck, but he didn't and it's by the collarbone edges. Hughes keeps pushing and Casemiro doesn't stop him, in turn it's not even shirt grabbing as Hughes violently turns back into melee. Twitter provides a fancam angle literally in front of the brawl with a much better view then whatever shit VAR is using these days.


How does the Palace prick who clattered into Antony get away without any card or reprimand? Is that not a card worthy offence? No intention of playing the ball and it's not even an accidental, ""Oh I can't control my running and I'm using you as a barrier"", it's pure intentional fouling and no intention of even apologising. The maggot literally sees him and turns back.


I've seen the Ayew clip, my guy thinks he's the Don and is very much aggressively initiating and instigating a fight, but nope, VAR will focus and zoom in on United because we went into to protect Antony.

"Just a What-if thought about our summer transfer -

Since we've heard a lot of interest for Mctominay throughout this winter and last summer windows, how about we sell him and VDB and get two good midfielders - not big money or big names but just good midfielders.

If Sabitzer clicks here, then we can try to negotiate with Bayern for him for around 40M and get someone like Phalina for Casemiro backup. I absolutely love Phalina playing the perfect destroyer role ahead of the defence. Ik he is not as good as Casemiro but he is the type of midfielder which we all thought Mctominay can be. Phalina could be available for less than 50M, if negotiated right. So we will have 2 good midfielders for less than 100M + we will have Zidane and Mainoo.

Realistically we need a top CF, a gk, a RB and a Top MF but as per priority CF has to be no. 1 which will cost atleast a 100M + the midfielders market is very thin and expensive rn, our targets are Rice (Chelsea have a eye on him or maybe Arsenal), Bellingham (Real Madrid, PSG, Liverpool, City, US and maybe Chelsea too are in for him), FDJ (Barca are releasing Busqutes next season, so no chance they will be selling FDJ to us + he himself doesn't want to leave) and all these guys will be hell lot of expensive - more than 120M easily. So Bringing Osimehen, Sabitzer and Phalina seems a more feasible option rather than wasting the summer like last time chasing a top, expensive midfielder and in the process also raising the prices of our other targets.",Manchester United,No,j761fgo,t3_10t7kb1

Now to start I think its disgusting what he has done and its unfortunate that the case was dropped as he deserves punishment for his actions.


However I dont think Mason is going anywhere and come August he will be playing for us again. He may never get the fans to chant his name and be remembered fondly. But really the fans opinions mean very little to players and the club. If they did the Glazers would have sold up a decade ago.

So I can see Mason being brought back into the fold and explicitly told to keep his head down and have no social presence and just focus on his football. 
When he does play he will be booed by everyone and rightly so until he scores and unfortunately he will be cheered. With his talent and if hes able to develop more into the player we all thought he would become then this case will be nothing more than a stain on his career.",Manchester United,No,j76dnwj,t3_10t7kb1

"I think their players are shot mentally after being really good for a few years with not that much to show for it (one UCL, one Prem title and that's it). Still good achivements, but City always seemed just a bit better and that has to be quite draining for the players.

Their owners also did the same mistake the Glazers did - allowed the team to get old and stale because the manager was papering over the cracks and the signigns made in the meantime were short-term quick fixes at best.

Liverpool's midfield is absolutely woeful. Their attack has some goalscoring potential, but not really any creativity. Their fullbacks have regressed quite a lot too, but I think they are the victims of their midfield woes. Liverpool went from something like Wijnaldum-Fabinho-Henderson hard working in-form midfield three that allowed Robertson/Trent the freedom to attack freely into the current situation where none of their midfielders can be relied upon. Thiago is good but constantly injured, Fabinho turned to shit, Henderson turned to shit, Keita is shit (and injured most of the time).... at the end of the day, they have to rely on geriatric Milner and youngsters who aren't really perfoming. To top that, they often play Elliott despite him not being a midfielder just because they have no other options.

Liverpool fans are salivating over the prospect of Bellingham (hopefully we overtake them, we could offer a lot right now) but what they should do is take some 100mil and completely revamp their midfield three.

"If someone would pay him all his salary, I'd be willing to send him away for free. He won't be able to get his current salary at any club, that's why it's so hard for us to sell him.",Manchester United,Yes,j78huxz,t1_j78fls2
"I wouldn't risk it. I am pretty confident it shouldn't have been a red card, but the way the rules work, if we do appeal then he'll be able to play in the next Leeds match but we'd be risking his availability for the Carabao cup final if the appeal fails.

"This. People want to justify this shit by saying we need to be morally clean and better by not relying on the refereeing. In an ideal world, that would be very much the case but it isn't an ideal world and we are very much interconnected to the refereeing performance irrespective of our progress. Every team has and every team will. 

What's morally right is to play by the same set of rules. For years people have been complaining that we need to grow a spine, and when we finally do everyone wants it to be a goody two shoes sort of legally clean shit. You need to have the spine to stand against and be careful of stretching the rules. Casemiro's inst a red for the same reason Schlupp doesn't get a red or Ayew. Same set of rules for similar ""violent behaviour"", and no, Case doesn't choke or hold Hughes by the neck.

The more important question is why is Chelsea letting go the likes of Jorginho & Ziyech but not Mount. No particular hate but he really looks done...like idk...gives Vibes like a certain someone who was with us🙃,Manchester United,Yes,j75sqo7,t1_j75s3o0
Is it impossible that he just likes Chelsea?,Manchester United,Yes,j75ynyw,t1_j75s3o0
Why shouldn’t he? Did Chelsea suddenly become a small club coz they’re having a bad season? Why did Casemiro join Utd? You’re talking as if he has joined Bournemouth or something.,Manchester United,Yes,j75u4u1,t1_j75s3o0
"beside chelsea paying him extremely well, they have shown a lot of ambition by spending so much already. of cos thing might not work out, nobody can guarantee that. every rival fans will be on their back cos of their spending. they will just rinse and repeat until they strike gold. we gave 2 years to sancho and still hoping he come good. think chelsea players have that much time?",Manchester United,Yes,j75xytp,t1_j75s3o0

It's not a moral dilemma but it's a business dilemma. Morals v business performance and profit. A bit like Apple using Foxconn factories in China which literally have to have anti suicide nets. It's clearly not moral for Apple to do so,Manchester United,Yes,j76hohu,t1_j76gj08
"Exactly that.

I think most United have the same opinion on the Greenwood matter…

He has to go.",Manchester United,Yes,j76ibra,t1_j76gj08
"He’s pacy, strong, a decent passer and his off ball work rate is fantastic. He’s a huge threat against high lines and a fairly good arial threat. He’s a pretty clinical finisher as well from what I’ve seen. Only negative is he’s not the best receiving the ball in between the lines. If we can get him, we absolutely need to go for it, he’d be a good fit.",Manchester United,Yes,j75yyh4,t1_j75y9gw

"I dunno, there is a fan camera angle where it doesn't look as bad, as he had one hand on his shoulder, but the var angle made it look like he was throttling him with both hands which was a bit misleading.

The VAR directly chose who they wanted to be sent off in that incident. They focused on a 3 second portion of Casemiros confrontation which misconstrued the situation while ignoring Ayews blatant red card. VAR could have ignored the incident or punished all players for their infractions but instead chose to target Casemiro. The VAR operators are a disgrace and I wouldn't be sad to see every single one of them fired.,Manchester United,Yes,j79qjd4,t1_j791mym

They need a rebuild.",Manchester United,Yes,j78nijb,t1_j78lno6
"I know what you mean, but I guess he’s also still trying to drill his system/ethics into the first XI players, particularly people like Antony.

I don’t want to burn those players out, but it is important we get our best team playing our best before we bring on the kids.",Manchester United,Yes,j769hlq,t1_j7697hh
"Makes you wonder will the Newcastle's owners do similar before the new rule kicks in? If it comes into play ?

Chelsea have some very smart lawyers in their stable and the rest of the league has to be kicking itself. Or they saw this opportunity before and decided against it due to the risk of the long term contracts on offer.

Lots of factors like injuries long term or the player just isn't living upto the potential etc too many managerial changes potentially could fuck with a players development if he is constantly in and out of a different regimes team etc.",Manchester United,Yes,j769g30,t1_j766pae
"You wouldn't do it if you had a limited budget because it demands a very high success rate on your transfers, and you're locking yourselves into big, unrecoverable losses on purchases that don't work out.

But if you back yourself to make the right calls, you do it.

And if you get it right, you're going to reap some serious rewards in the long run.

You'll be in a spot like Real, where you're not chasing teams playing catch-up needing 4 first-eleven quality signings every window, as your squad ages out - but just supplementing it with a smaller number of high quality signings.

It's mainly a question of whether those signings will be hits or misses.",Manchester United,Yes,j76714b,t1_j766pae
"How can you say you respect it though? What do you respect about it? Plenty of cool transfers yeah but what if half of them flop? What if this is a disaster. Yeah they need time but even today turned out another stinker, they have no clear play style, no defined identity, a manager on shaky ground and their results are terrible. 

Never seen a bad team get so much praise for what they might do in the future. As a United fan you should know transfers don't equal success",Manchester United,Yes,j76buag,t1_j766pae
"If Boehly loses the gamble he’s a couple hundred million poorer, but Chelsea fans stand to lose much more. It’s not even mudryk and enzo that are that bad, it’s the other spending that seems like poor moves that would make the financial risk of mudryk and enzo not working out that much greater",Manchester United,Yes,j76g83z,t1_j766pae
"Certainly something we'll keep in mind when we overhaul the green and gold design soon, *hopefully*.

I think the standard of reffing is just getting worse. I think var has made refs lazy and now with this new approach of not correcting errors if it’s not “obvious” plus the people running it still being morons makes it the worst league for refs.

"I was blown away by Sabitzer's drive to win the ball and then the way he aggressively passes it forward. Our whole profile changed. We were razor sharp in midfield with him on the pitch. For all of his genius qualities, Eriksen doesn't bring that hunting sharpness. And Sabitzer blocks off passing lines brilliantly too.

Like you, my first thought was the quality difference between him and McTominay. He could level up the team in the same way that Case and Licha have.

Pure class.",Manchester United,Yes,j7a38tg,t1_j79zlxz

"You'll be the same one screaming for joy when he bangs 2 against Barca. He is admittedly not 100 percent this year, after battling several lower body injuries. A summer of rest and knowing that there is a structure of which he fits, will return him to where he belongs.   


Many of you have never played sports past primary school and it shows with your knowledge of athletic anatomy.",Manchester United,Yes,j77xm8y,t1_j77gr81

"Sign a ST when? We spent over £200 mil in the summer on positions that have been proven to be more important. There was no money in Jan and even if there was, a top striker wasn’t available.

Obviously the club has been mismanaged for years and I can’t wait for the Glazers to leave but since Ten Hag took over he has been backed. We can’t do everything in one summer window. The signing of a ST had to wait and it seems likely it will be Kane in the summer.",Manchester United,Yes,j794vvi,t1_j78i94u
"Sangare.

Caicedo?,Manchester United,Yes,j78oh1j,t1_j78kidz
"The problem is it’s a specialist position. You want a DM good enough to deputise Casemiro then you are looking at spending a starting XI transfer fee on a backup. That’s even if you can convince a DM that good to be a backup.

Likely it would be someone who can play multiple positions and can just fill in there at a need.

Funnily enough that might be Sabitzer. Lindelof has also played DM in the past though I’d consider that one very unlikely.",Manchester United,Yes,j793zez,t1_j78kidz
"Can't back it up with facts, but feel like picking and choosing competitions is playing with fire. Personally I love EtH's philosophy of the most important game is the next one and we want to win every game.",Manchester United,Yes,j78rn9i,t1_j78ns1s

"The issue is that he never put his hand on his throat vs grabbed his collar (scene in multiple angles ), the issue is that a ref can’t tell the difference so not doing either is ideal.",Manchester United,Yes,j789rnw,t1_j7887k4
"I get what you mean. They're not necessarily dominant in the way a team like City and Liverpool have been in recent years.

"We absolutely can blame him for getting injured. After almost 8 years, it’s time to get rid of him.",Manchester United,Yes,j76o7o5,t1_j76nmeu
"If we let Scott and Donny go, and sign Sabitzer and Palhinha, our youngest first-team MF at the start of the next season will be Palhinha (28). We would need a younger midfielder between 22 and 27 if we look for the long-term project. Zidane and Mainoo are not there yet.",Manchester United,Yes,j7620p2,t1_j761fgo
Bayern were already trying to sell Sabitzer last summer and will be even more desperate to do so this summer with Laimer coming in on a free transfer. They paid 16m euros for him and were hoping to get that much back at best. If anyone ends up paying 40m for him they should be banned from making business decisions anywhere for the rest of their life.,Manchester United,Yes,j765z7f,t1_j761fgo
"We can get Sabitzer for less than that, I'm sure. They'll have six midfielders ahead of him next season - Musiala, Kimmich, Goretzka, Gravenberch, Wanner and Laimer. 

If he does well here, we should offer them about €20m. But I do think a midfield core of Case, Fred, Sabitzer, Eriksen and another signing is pretty strong.",Manchester United,Yes,j767paq,t1_j761fgo
"VDB was obviously in Ten Hag’s plans before his injury. Plus he’s a good depth option to keep around.

Barcelona are not “releasing” Busquets, his contract is expiring.",Manchester United,Yes,j761jup,t1_j761fgo
"The market for top top players is always tough, every big team is looking to improve their squad, it's nothing new. Wouldn't mind if we take a punt on some youngsters. Read from shit tier source that we're monitoring Antony Booth, honestly wouldn't mind him, he looks good, wouldn't cost too much and is young, or someone like Kamada. We need to bring young blood in, our key players will start declining soon. It's not like we need a nailed on starter for every position, we are fine except CF and maybe GK. As Ten Hag said, we need smart signings as well. Wouldn't mind 1 or 2 big signings, and 1 or 2 young squad players who Ten Hag can mould into his vision, kinda like Malacia, who can get the job done if needed and have high potential for development",Manchester United,Yes,j764lc1,t1_j761fgo
"Realistically in the summer united still need to overhaul the midfield.

It's been the same for far too long we will now find out the affect of not having eriksen in the team and how we cope will be a big factor in how our summer plays out.

Casemiro Eriksen Fred I think those 3 will definitely be at the club start of next season. Fred offers the engine room and can do a job from the bench or lesser games or in a midfield 3 with the other 2.

Mctominay is done at United. He is one name that should be moved on and someone from the youth for CM takes his place. Garner springs to mind give him a run in the first team.

We still need 2 more midfielders aside with mctominay leaving. We know ten hag wanted FDJ do we even go for him when he didn't want us ?

Who else is out there? Bellingham would be the dream but will he come to united?  

Definitely need another player that's younger in the mould of Eriksen the creative spark and be the understudy to Eriksen and grow into the role and definitely need another understudy to Casemiro. Fred is a different player to Casemiro and can't even compare the 2. 

2 younger aged midfielders between 19-23 would be ideal. Who fits that category? 

A striker in the summer. I genuinely hope we aren't serious about Kane. Although new ownership I wouldn't care if we spent the money on Kane but if it's still glazere come summer? Let it be a upcoming super star. Why aren't we plucking players like Madrid have done recently?  We need to be in that south American talent pool finding these players.",Manchester United,Yes,j76a2m6,t1_j761fgo
"City, title challenge is off the books anyway. I want to secure top 4 as early as possible.

"You underestimate fan power. Just look at the super league.

The backlash to playing that guy will be unbearable. Constant booing and protests. Endless chants of rape - you think broadcasters want that being heard every time Utd are on.

No he will leave. Unfortunately he’ll get game time in some other league but that’s their problem.",Manchester United,Yes,j76mzt4,t1_j76dnwj

"Doesn't really seem that way at all. He mentions that he's not done and says he wants to fight to be the best and become the starter again once he reaches full fitness.

"Martial? Yes. 

Greenwood? I wouldn't mind tearing his contract apart and kicking him out with no compensation.

VDB? Yeah, probably, but I can see Ten Hag keeping him. Got unfortunate with his injury.

He already played for Madrid, and wanted a new challenge to play in EPL. City already had Rodri, Arsenal don't do that type of signing, the only other viable option was Chelsea itself if not United, plus we had our agents Fred and Varane whispering into his ear. Enzo had the world at his feet, and right now it looks stupid decision.

You can say that about literally every single transfer. I have the chance to sign some of the biggest talents on the market, why would I not do it? Because there's a chance they could flop?

And last year people really forget Rashford carried these team and would have continued to. But then injuries bad management and all the drama of USL and the politics of COVID where he was forced to step up as PM and take on a lot of stress.

His players are really versatile and can play multiple positions, I assume Ten Hag will also try to do the same thing in next 3-4 years. 15-16 really good world class players, but then that's it.

"Mate literally everyone in that brawl put their hands around every part of the upper torso, just because for a split second my hand is on your neck while your charging in trying to punch and being an aggressor isn't going to mean I have commited a card worthy offence. 

Watch the clip, Casemiro puts his hands around the collarbone edge near the shirt hem, and Hughes keeps charging in, Casemiro isn't resisting, he lets him freely move and doesn't even hold him back when Hughes turns back in to melee.

The game says that an action deemed violent conduct performed by a player is a red card, who's the rampaging violently aggressive player here? Casemiro or Hughes?

By that Standard, the Palace player who calttered into Antony should most definitely be red carded as well. Violent conduct there as well. Playing loose with technicalities is why the refereeing this country is a disgrace to the game.",Manchester United,Yes,j77y61s,t1_j77x2xx

"Not saying to not sign a young midfielder in the coming years, it's just that our current need is a top CF - Bruno, Eriksen, Casemiro, Fred, Phalina, Sabitzer is a great midfield option to have + we can rely on them for 2-3 years easily and then going big for a couple of young midfielders, since we didn't have to worry about our attack for atleast 5 years after getting someone like Osimehen since our attack will be young.

Phalina is a must have option, since we can't depend on Casemiro week in, week out to bail us out without experiencing fatigue. VDB is a technically gifted player but it is difficult to keep him in a role for a PL midfielder - fast, strong, energetic.

"Try looking at La Liga and Serie A attendances and tell me it doesn't affect things. England/Wales has teams in the 5th tier pulling in bigger attendances than top tier teams in Spain and Italy. There are multiple teams in the 3rd tier pulling in 20000-25000 who would have the *8th biggest* attendance in Italy and Spain's top tiers. When the difference is that stark, we don't even need to look at the tiny attendances in Italy and Spain's lower leagues. 

German is competitive for the 1st tier, and even the 2nd tier is decent. 3rd tier it starts dropping off and by the 4th tier most teams are drawing 200-300, whilst the biggest team gets 3000. In England's 4th tier, most clubs draw about 6000, whilst the biggest team gets 17000. England's 6th tier has a higher attendance than Germany's 4th.

"""Here’s a rundown of some of the issues that have reportedly plagued Foxconn’s factories:

■ Suicides. The company was hit by a wave of worker suicides in 2010. Other incidents have occurred since.

■ Wage and hours exploitation. In 2012, Foxconn was accused of underpaying wages and having its employees work excessive hours. In response, the company pledged to curtail the length of shifts and raise wages.

■ Serious accidents. One Foxconn worker was left brain damaged after an electric shock in 2011. An explosion in one factory killed four people and injured another 18 in the same year.

■ Underage and illegal workers. Foxconn admitted to having hired teenagers as young as 14 at one of its factories in 2012. Late last year, Apple confirmed that, at a plant where its iPhone X is made, student workers were discovered to be working overtime — in violation of local laws.

■ Riots. More than 1,000 workers were involved in a violent disturbance at one of the company’s factories in 2012.

 Poor living standards. The New York Times reported in 2012 that as many as 20 workers could be housed in three-room staff apartments""

"It’s up to him as well. It’s clear he can’t be the number 1 striker so if that’s an issue he can leave.

Extremely generic and overrated Reddit take. You only need to look at how much money Chelsea generate every season  through sales. As an example, they just bought Enzo for £105m. They already had a £40m+ offer for Gallagher. They regularly fetch £50-100m every single season through sales. Their academy exists for this purpose.

Only fools would begin their search after Eriksen's injury was confirmed....... 2 days after he initially got injured. Mfers were sitting and waiting until then or something? Should've already explored loan deals even before he got injured ffs.

That telegraph article a couple days ago - ""Richard Arnold is an alpha male in some regards"" ......like, what?? Embarassing mate. I kinda feel like Roy Keane reading this articles. It's your job.",Manchester United,No,j71b65q,t3_10seufa
Who should I triple captain: Bruno or Rashford?,Manchester United,No,j72lllq,t3_10seufa
That Chelsea line up is incredibly meh. Ziyech and Gallagher were both being linked on the way out and surplus last week and they are starting. I get that they have a ton of injuries but even at full strength it one of the worst put together teams..strike me as a mega wealthy Everton,Manchester United,No,j736p7a,t3_10seufa
Both Enzo and Palhinha looking competent in tonight’s game. It’s a shame because either would have been beneficial for us but can’t dwell on such things. More mids in the world and hope we bring a couple more good ones into our ranks,Manchester United,No,j73w0sy,t3_10seufa
"Just speculating here but I can't see why there'd be any legal issue with dropping him to the reserves, making him train alone if possible, then claiming publicly that the investigation is ongoing and working on a mutual termination or some legal route to sacking him by the summer. Like there is a lot of precedent of old school managers refusing to play someone they don't like and I haven't seen any cases where the player can sue. I'll admit that the club would face constant questions if they did string it out like this though.",Manchester United,No,j71bszh,t3_10seufa

The kid is currently too thick & full of his moon sized ego to realize that his career at the top level is over. Once that reality sets in he's going to take it out on the closest person he can blame which is her obviously. Physical abusers aren't big on introspection.

There's also no indication that he'll get any sort of help to deal with whatever psychological issues he has. I just hope I'm wrong.",Manchester United,No,j710thf,t3_10seufa
"Legally, i believe Mason shouldn't be in jail. In my eyes there isn't enough evidence that he actually did something. Even at the end of the recording he says ""get off me"". The pictures also dont criminalise him specifically.

"Are there any legal grounds to terminate Mason, seeing as our club had a rapist on the books only 2 months ago. We also have a convicted criminal as club captain, so what morality clause could he have possibly breached?I think they can only move him if he wants to move on, but I don’t see legal grounds for termination. He still has 4 years left and terminating him will impact our ability to buy players. I read he will be paid 16 million if we terminated him and he can sue for a breach of contract and get more. Last thing we need is to be spending on lawyers and a long complex legal battle. Also, why is the FA leaving these type of disciplines to the clubs and not handling them? Man Utd is a big target because we are on the stock market and everything we do influence our stock prices. Many of our competitors don’t have this problem, I can easily see a Newcastle or Chelsea picking him up. Hell even a Benfica and they can clean his image and flip him for 100 mill. Our club will end up being clowned, like yea we did the right thing but at what cost? Also should the club not be trying to help rehabilitate the guy, seeing as his behaviour is a sign of a problem. The thing I’ve noticed under ETH is that he seems to be more understanding of players, see how he treated Sancho. The Man Utd dressing room was very toxic last season, Martial having affairs, AWB having affairs, Maguire getting arrested. Even if Mason doesn’t play, perhaps they should go the rehab route to the end of the season. I listened to the audio and he comes across as a pompous entitled donkey that gets his way. However, I do not think he is beyond salvation.

How is Havertz still starting for Chelsea?? I would be absolutely livid if I was a Chelsea fan. He's a slow Timo Werner. Genuinely what does he offer to a premier league side?

"The truth of the matter is there are still many supporters that want Greenwood back. Like someone posted of video of Dalot being back in training and in the comments of that video and in the other video from the same creator about Greenwood, you can seeing many people eagerly awaiting his return.

It is just like how many people will rejoice if an oil state bought us and how people were shocked that Zouma got punished for kicking his cat.

In my country at least, these people fall in these categories, 

- not their problem. Like if you did these things to people they know, they would definitely care and there will be a reaction but outside of that, they don't care especially if the person is famous. Doesn't help that we have been and are still getting screwed by foreign nations, so it is harder to care about their matters.

- People are just that bad. Like I have seen some shit in my country that are just as bad as what is reported in some of the oil states, maybe not as large scale though. There are many uneducated and even the education in the country is not that great.

Poor Paul is still milking his 15 minutes of fame after he claimed he could have done as good a job as Solskaer in Solskaer's first few months in charge at United.

I think at the minute it's fairly straight forward... Either ban questions outright or allow 1 question at next presser but with ETH responding...

"If we win a trophy or two, finish top 4, get new owners with burning pockets, and hoping that ETH can give a hell of a convincing speech to Jude, I think we’d definitely have a chance.

City seem like they are in the latter stages of a rebuild and don’t look as dominant as previous seasons.

Madrid is Madrid but it looks like they’re not quite as good as they were last season.

I ultimately think Jude would pick a club with a better track record of recent success, but he might just be convinced by the philosophy of Ten Hag and potentially being a key player in the third coming of United",Manchester United,Yes,j7184sd,t1_j717jh3
Do we need him tho ? For more than half the budget most likely is that sensible,Manchester United,Yes,j718d4o,t1_j717jh3
"Depends on whether or not we have new owners by then and can find a way to navigate around FFP

I don't see a way we sign him under glazers as we need other positions too so 120-150m on a CM will massively limit us bringing in a top class CF, possibly a new 1st choice keeper and other squad strengthening for players that move on (replacements for Maguire / AWB??)

"I've always thought Caqueret is a more defensive player, and I'd prefer someone who's got more going forward. Not sure if that's just the role he's asked to play for Lyon, but I can only go by what I see.

I'd really like us to sign Milinkovic-Savic. He's a presence in the middle and is superb going forward. Good option for set-pieces too. He'll only have 12 months left on his contract in the summer so he should be available at a non-extortionate price.",Manchester United,Yes,j72l5dm,t1_j7240rd
Bennacer would be my ideal choice after Bellingham Personally,Manchester United,Yes,j72cmpy,t1_j7240rd

"What he did wasn't a mistake, it was the way he lived his life. He treated his girlfriend like that because he believed he was entitled to. I can accept someone genuinely learning and changing their ways. If they're willing to be educated and to understand why their thought processes were wrong and damaging, then I do believe people can become better people.

Trouble is, there's no indication that Greenwood has changed and, even if his camp start putting PR stuff out, there's no way to know it's anything more than an artifice to rehab his image.",Manchester United,Yes,j71hh1w,t1_j719r2w
"he has 100% been training while on bail. If they decide to bring him back, we will not see him before next season, after some PR exercise and probably joint-statements from the families, they will for sure wait for the dust to settle and ease him in.

Players have 1 year lay-offs due to injuries and they do not lose their abilities. Just look at Shaw.

I trust the club to do the right thing, and will be behind it whatever that may be.",Manchester United,Yes,j719sj6,t1_j718xh1

"He is a naturally gifted footballer, stood out from very early on, 2 footed, very good technique etc. His ability will still be there and as a 21year old with no injury history to speak of his fitness should come back pretty quickly.

If we were going to reintegrate him (which to be clear is not what we should do IMO) I could see him being match ready withing 4-6weeks",Manchester United,Yes,j719sd6,t1_j718xh1

My view on it anyway.",Manchester United,Yes,j71sz63,t1_j71kkpc
"The thing is right thing legally doesn't always match up with the right thing morally as is the case here

In the eyes of the legal system he has no case to answer and for people that believe in that institution there are no legal grounds to get rid of him so LEGALLY we probably should be bound to reintegrate him or at least continue to give him his salary and facilities to train until his contract is up even if that is individual training away from the group

Morally though that's clearly the wrong option and the public nature of the evidence dictates that fans / sponsors / players(?) will not simply accept him resuming his role in the squad as before. however we can't terminate his deal unilaterally so the announcement yesterday that all charges have been dropped makes it more difficult for club as we are somewhat forced to make a decision, whereas before we could just park the issue and keep him under contract and away from club until the legal proceedings reached conclusion

Even the moral aspect though is grey area, for me its clear cut, he shouldn't play for us again. others thought think morally we have a duty of care to player and victim as young adults to make sure they have the support and structure around them to get past this and help rehabilitate to whatever extent we can

I feel like greenwood still has a big say in this, if he accepts he has no future and agrees to part ways on a free and move abroad (seems like best outcome?) then it's best outcome imo but I don't think club can force that if he decides he doesn't want to tear up his contract and ride out the storm in Manchester then we are in a very difficult spot

Honestly lots of factors to this one. I wouldn't wanna be deciding the next steps

I don't want him ever wearing man utd jersey again, but I think is too simplistic to say we should just terminate his contract",Manchester United,Yes,j712eg7,t1_j710zku

"I'm still not convinced. He has improved his abilities on the ball which is good, but he still has pretty big issues with defensive positioning. If he faces crosses, he struggles because he can't really mark players in the box which cost us against both City and Arsenal.

If Southgate was doing the call up now, then I am pretty confident he would pick Tripper (obvious), Walker (because he trusts him) and maybe White who has been doing really well for Arsenal.",Manchester United,Yes,j74tsf5,t1_j7464my

"I can't imagine he has any passionate defenders demanding him back... In the dressing room, at least.

Some players likely don't care that much and think he'd be an asset, but that wouldn't be enough to cause a rift with players who absolutely don't want him back.",Manchester United,Yes,j7192h2,t1_j718n13
I'm not sure the fanbase really is that divided. There have been those few weirdos posting made up stories that he's about to come back into the squad over the past year. Sadly that seems to be concentrated among fans from countries where women's safety is far lower still than in the UK.

"People tend to severely overrate Greenwood honestly, he only had one really elite skill which was his finishing.

"Agreed. I only read the articles today about the bail violations and it's mind-blowing to me. 

From what the articles say, he was violating his bail conditions by contacting the victim, which his own lawyer admitted had been happening for months. Then police arrest him in October after finding him with the victim, he's denied bail as they know he'll break the conditions again, but he gets this overturned after 2 days in a private court session and presumably continues contacting and visiting the victim up until now. And his lawyer says the police knew all this was happening. So why did they allow that to continue?

A petrol state like Saudi makes United into a rag to wipe up blood and it would no longer even feel like real football and with Greenwood, it's just rotten and we then would have this spectre sitting over the club?

5. The dressing room was very toxic last season because our interim manager couldnt stop running off his mouth in the public. Remember last few months of Jose reign? Eerily similar. ETH thankfully has shown the respect towards the club and players while maintaining high disipline.

6. Mason is a massive cunt. Theres a reason why ole and the club tried to hard to protect him in his breakthrough season, giving him ""Giggsy Treatment"" to keep media out of him.

I'll never understand this argument. He was constantly moved around the pitch and played in different systems, and he couldn't find consistency? No shit. Maybe he would have found consistency if he was played in a consistent system with a consistent role. Like when he played in a flat three with Matic and Herrera.

"Everyone might want to take a break and abstain from giving their thoughts on the Greenwood situation for now.

Everyone knows their thoughts, and *nobody* will change their minds based on whatever argument the other side puts forward, because it is a discussion of principle and morals - and those are often unchanging.

I will say this: many of us heard and saw *some* evidence with our own eyes, drew our own conclusions, and already have our opinion on the matter. From there, it's not a simple case of the victim refusing to fully follow through with the process that has resulted in the charges being dropped. Apparently, ""new evidence"" been brought to the table that has been key to the proceedings - it seemingly wasn't a *lack* of confirming evidence, but presence of contradictory evidence.

So, what we're left with is this: the only facts of the matter is that someone has had the charges dropped after an extensive investigation and so, from a legal standpoint, we've got a player that's been accused of rape (+ other charges) that has *effectively* been found innocent / not guilty / not provably guilty (by way of the charges being dropped).

The only thing that stands to be seen is the club's stance on the matter and their next actions.

Off the top of my head, here are a few things to note:

 * They have to respect the decision of the prosecutor/police force/whoever else was involved from a legal standpoint and are required to uphold the contract. (The club won't win a disrepute case for someone being ""wrongly"" (as it stands) accused of something).

 * That contract provides a lot of value on an asset that either has high playing value (if he were to return) or high potential sale value (another club will surely take someone of his quality). The club could look to sell or play him.

 * Alternatively, the club could discuss with Greenwood and come to an agreement to mutually terminate the agreement - or to agree to a reduced payout if they're clear that he won't play for us again due to the club's stance on the charges.

 * However, from a social standpoint, we're *supposed* to respect the decision of the court and not ""punish"" people for accusations alone.

 * Then there are the players. Are any of them still friends with him? What do they think? Will they accept him back in the squad? And do they have a say in the matter?

 * At the bottom of the totem pole, regardless of the decision the club makes, lies the public - the fans and the watching media. Any decision will be scrutinized and there's a great deal of nuance to any decision - even if some of us don't want to see it.

But saying that you will never watch games or will support the club if he returns seems hypocritical af.

Where was this energy when Ronaldo was starting nearly every game for us last season? Our fanbase literally voted him as our POTY and viva ronaldo chants were regularly sung at OT waaay before he even returned, and never have I seen many united fans point out that was wrong even after his rape allegations were brought to the public eye in 2017.

We literally have a statue of George Best outside OT, he's hailed as a hero, his chants are regularly still sung by fans of all ages when he was complete pos that beat his wife and was an alcoholic. Ryan Giggs and Nicky Butt are still labeled as United legends, and even tho Giggs wasn't charged with domestic abuse back in 2011, when stories abt him cheating with his brother's wife for 10+ years came out I've not seen this fanbase be outraged and demand his departure from the club.

Even looking outside of United you see the likes of Marcos Alonso who bloody killed someone make a career for himself in football, Karim Benzema who is a convicted criminal and who was officially banned from the national team eventually won the ballond'or and welcomed back to the national side with open arms. Thomas Partey who has 3+ Rape allegations and on his 3rd bail still playing regularly for Arsenal and praised by their entire fanbase and media just because he's decent at kicking a football. Footballers that go around drink driving and nobody bats an eye.

If MG returns to United(big if) and he starts scoring 20+ goals, I bet you 80% of the shit online abt him rn will go away and get drowned out by masses that will start praising him again

Some clubs have in the past openly backed racists, overlooked child molestation accusations  and at the moment there are a couple of players playing for clubs who have got off rape charges on technicalities. I don't want that for my club. 


With the women's game growing and the promise from clubs that womens sport is to be taken seriously what better way for Manchester united to set the benchmark for that. 


I've heard it would cost united 10 and a half million to pay out Greenwood's contract. I think that's nothing in what it would do for the club as a whole to set this bench mark. To change the culture of football with one strike of a pen. 


Send Greenwood to a country that doesn't care of his exploits, he couldn't even behave himself while out on bail, he will be back in trouble soon enough. He doesn't deserve to wear a united Jersey. 


Let it be clear that the club isn't struggling for money because of one scumbag getting released, it's because the owners are leeches. The fan base will not overlook Greenwood's behaviour just to allow the leeches to save a few pound.

The Antony signing makes even less sense with him coming back.  Maybe he can play as a centre forward next season, we can get shot of Martial and buy a first choice player there.  It would be a lot of faith to put him if he were just going to the No. 9.",Manchester United,No,j6xrbv4,t3_10rle43

"Charges of attempted rape and assault have been dropped against Manchester United footballer Mason Greenwood.

The 21-year-old was arrested in January last year amid allegations surrounding images and videos that emerged online.

He was later charged with attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

The Crown Prosecution Service said the charges were discontinued after key witnesses withdrew their involvement.

A spokesman said: ""We have a duty to keep cases under continuous review.

""In this case a combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. In these circumstances, we are under a duty to stop the case.

""We have explained our decision to all parties.

""We would always encourage any potential victims to come forward and report to police and we will prosecute wherever our legal test is met.""

Within hours of the allegations surfacing online at the beginning of 2022, the forward, who has made one appearance for England, was suspended from playing or training with the Old Trafford club.

The club has been asked by the BBC to comment.

Greater Manchester Police said it was ""only fair"" to announce Greenwood would no longer face criminal proceedings.

Ch Supt Michaela Kerr said the decision had ""not been taken lightly"".

She added: ""I would, however, like to use this opportunity to reiterate the force's commitment to investigating allegations of violence against women and girls and supporting those affected, regardless of their circumstances, throughout what can be a hard and upsetting time for them.""",Manchester United,No,j6x4moj,t3_10rle43

"I think fans are underestimating what a good PR move would be for the club. **Mason Greenwood needs to rehabilitate his name and image**. But releasing him to another club is actually stupid. First it assumes that another club would be happy with a lad accused of rape. It's also racist to think that it would be Turkey or Saudi Arabia and not some European country. Second, if you assume that another club would take him, then why not your own club?

I think the club has to be smart. **Mason is an asset that has seen his value go down through the serious allegations and the public's esteem**. It could be he isn't good enough after not training for a year, so he needs to be sold or loaned out. But the decision has to be strictly for footballing reasons. IMO, the club needs to lead a PR tour to convince fans and the public at large that he is a changed footballer. It starts with the club imposing their own sanctions for improper conduct. There needs to be the perception that he is punished in some way for his actions. The club needs to also consider loaning Mason out for footballing reasons, to get him back into the game. But then a decision has to be made if he is still as good as he was before.

For me it solves a lot of issues having Mason, if he is the Mason of before. I don't want to talk about Mason's integration into the team, as the news is still a bit raw to some fans here.

">**how and why** things unfolded as they did?

Simple. Rape cases are impossible to prosecute without the victim's cooperation. Because even with video or stuff like that, the rapist can claim ""its our kink"" and since there is nobody there to contradict him, the system cant do shit.

In this particular case the police said they lost a key witness. So Harriet refused to cooperate, and it makes the prosecution job impossible.",Manchester United,Yes,j6yk60y,t1_j6yja7k
"I completely agree it will be a cold cost/benefit analysis but I think it’s more likely to result in Greenwood never playing for Utd again. 

A lot of people bring up Partey and Ronaldo’s case but neither of them have had to deal with the kind of damming audio/visual evidence in public that Greenwood’s faced. From a PR standpoint it’s much worse and it’s something that will more likely impact current/future sponsorship deals. 

>blanket refusal

The fact of the matter is that he is a free man, and he will be living among everyone else. So if he decides with the help of the club to becoma decent man, I believe that is better then terminating the contract and him potentially continuing being a terrible human being.

If the decision is made to hang on to him, I expect there will be an explanation, an apology, and the club makes him do a course of some sort as well as some form of community service/joining a domestic violence survivors group to help understand the consequences of his actions.

"Regular people aren't multimillion pound assets ""owned"" by multibillion pound clubs bound by intricate, multimillion pound employment contracts devised on a case by case basis to be airtight by contract law specialists (agents). There are also overlapping rules with organizations like FIFA, FIFPro, the PL, UEFA, etc. regarding players' rights and how clubs can and can't punish them. 

That's one of the reasons why no matter how much bad behavior goes on for however long (refusing to train to try to force a move away, for example), it's generally impossible to fine players more than two weeks wages for their antics. The kid has a binding long term contract with us and we have no legal recourse against him while an investigation is ongoing, let alone now that the whole thing has been dropped. 

The internal investigation is going to decide whether he ever plays or trains for us again (hopefully he won't). Even if he's frozen out, unless he agrees to terminate his contract we'll be paying him until it expires in 2025 (since we obviously won't pick up the one year option in that case).

"I think that, generally speaking, rehabilitation and re-acceptance back into society is dependent on a number of different factors. The first is an admission of guilt without reservation, demonstrating that the person understands what they've done wrong, why it was wrong, and who was victimized by it. They may want to offer excuses or explanations but those only serve to undercut the admission of guilt (""I admit that I did this and that YOU thought I was wrong, but I feel justified in my actions""). If they can't jump that hurdle then the whole process is dead in the water. Second is restitution: what steps are being taken to compensate the victim for the harm? This can take many different forms and likely never can equal the harm done, but it shows the willingness to try to undo the harm caused. Third is doing the work to learn and reform behaviours. Again, what is required here can vary, but an apology without showing the desire to change and be better is worthless. Both the second and third points need to satisfy the victim, not society, to be actually meaningful - the lack of this is why the slaps on the wrist for racist behaviour by fans are so derided as no victim of the behaviour feels satisfied by the outcome. Lastly, the individual needs to ASK to let back in, leading with humility, rather than assuming or demanding a right to be let back in. They need to understand that being let back in is conditional and based on fulfilling the previous points, not something that is a right. This whole process needs to be transparent to the people that matter, i.e. the victims and perpetrator as well as any organizations that are associated with them.

Needless to say, our current society is terrible at accomplishing any of this and I feel that it is one of the reasons why it is so fractured. People are unwilling to accept that they've caused harm (or feel justified in causing it), are unwilling to do meaningful work to right wrongs, and the system has only two real remedies that it can enforce: jail (which requires a costly prosecution that may not be seen as ""worth it"") or a fine (which criminalizes poverty). We do it on a micro level with our friend groups all the time (when we care to keep the friendship) but have trouble translating it beyond our in-groups to strangers or society at-large.

In this case, many of the factors above are beyond our ability to know and can't have a reasonable expectation of knowing. And it is extremely unfortunate that we cannot trust institutions like Manchester United or the Premier League (really any for-profit organization that feels they can make more money by cutting corners) to do the work in the background to ensure things are done properly. We also can't trust that the decision to not proceed with charges is related to the facts of the case rather than the likelihood of getting a judgment in court (the statement leaves things vague). As such, it will be impossible for some, myself included, to cheer for an accused rapist. If I could have confidence that all the steps were followed or that the facts strongly countered the information that we know (e.g. recordings) I would be perfectly happy to give someone a second (last) chance, but we'll likely never know for sure.",Manchester United,Yes,j6xosnu,t1_j6xk0ak
"> But he is not going to be punished by the law, so what now? What is the proper response to a situation like this? I really don't know what should happen to him.

I watch football and United because I enjoy it. I will not enjoy it if I know I am watching a (as far as we know) non-repentant rapist.

I believe people should be allowed to grow and earn redemption, but Mason 100% is nowhere near the point where I'd be willing to cheer for him. He isn't redeemed because there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute him for something he obviously did. 

He'd have to spend a lifetime doing victim's outreach, come clean about what he did, and take a stand against his previous behavior and people who supported him through it.",Manchester United,Yes,j6xljlq,t1_j6xk0ak
"Worth remembering that not being allowed to play for a massive club in a very public job where you *are* a role model for children, and are given adulation from tens of thousands of people every week, earning an ungodly amount of money, doesn't mean your life is over and there are no other options for you.",Manchester United,Yes,j6xlg0g,t1_j6xk0ak

Bruno no question. From the moment he arrived he's propped the club up on his back and been at heart of everything good we've managed to do. Even when he's not doing well he never ever stops trying which isn't a given in football these days. He's been our captain on the pitch whether he's held the armband or not and he absolutely deserves the plaudits of being the one to win our first trophy in half a decade.,Manchester United,Yes,j6wrosh,t1_j6wlz3t

"There's a context we often miss when we think of our attacking depth. Ordinarily if we'd lost a player of Greenwoods quality we would've got £100million for it. So even if we still signed Antony for the same amount, as a club we'd still have the money to invest in a striker or midfielder.

This is a genuine question not meant to inflame. What do you want? Do you want people to be locked up for 3/20mins of an audio file? Is that strictly enough evidence for prison, or just enough for a sacking? 

It’s interesting to me because as a democracy we have a justice system in place to make these decisions and the decision has been made and reddit is against it with very limited information. Do we just throw away with the justice system altogether?",Manchester United,Yes,j6yc50j,t1_j6y7igr

That audio clip from him is awful. I appreciate that the witnessess backed off & the evidence is not substantial enough, but I dont wish to apply any speculative context to that clip.

Those two situations aren’t comparable to be fair,Manchester United,Yes,j6y6ite,t1_j6y57pc
"Yeah, I hope we get more targets like Casemiro where it doesn't seem like Erik has belled his mates up. But I think we will. We wanted Sabitzer before Ten Hag arrived too don't forget and even though it might feel connected since Eriksen played for Ajax I don't think him coming was all down to Ten Hag either",Manchester United,Yes,j70bivn,t1_j70ayo1
"I mean, that's perfectly reasonable for his first season at the club because he needed to establish a new culture and a new system. Getting players he knows like Lichá or Antony helps speed that process up a lot.

From summer onwards, I think we'll rely more on our scouting network.",Manchester United,Yes,j70cx96,t1_j70ayo1
"We just lost our Chief Scout and our global recruitment Head last summer. I can understand that we need time to recruit and rebuild the scouting network again. 

I'm not giving them any leeway but I can see why Erik relied on his own judgement here, if we persist like this then it's the club's problem for not getting this sorted quickly.",Manchester United,Yes,j70fqem,t1_j70ayo1

"Everything fell to pieces around when it came out last year. Obviously there was a load of other shit going wrong at the club at the time but it definitely had a big impact. We've just managed to get the team back working together after the shit show that was  Ronaldo. If greenwood comes walking back into the locker Room it will 100% damage our season. I don't know if football players would just forgive something like what hes obviously done but even if so there's guaranteed to be at least a few guys in the dressing room that want nothing to do with him and that's gonna cause a divide.

He needs to be nowhere near our first team and sold In the summer. Importantly as well this needs to be sorted out fast so every single question isn't about this cunt.",Manchester United,Yes,j6z27w7,t1_j6yzo2a
"What? No. Any attempt to try to rehabilitate his image from the club is going to blow up in their faces because of how in poor taste and horrible of a bad look that whole thing would be. He is a PR nightmare for any top club in the country, no one is picking him up, cut the losses and move on.",Manchester United,Yes,j6zc2a8,t1_j6z2k65
"🤮🤮🤮

Just no. Fuck the cunt, keep him as far away from the team as possible and never mention him again until he's sold or his contract terminated or whatever. If the club supports him or lets him back in, the club can get fucked too.",Manchester United,Yes,j6zgiyh,t1_j6z2k65

"What the fuck are you talking about? It's not like he was groomed or indoctrinated to be a sexual abuser. If you are 20 years old and your brain still can't figure out rape = bad then you're a scumbag.

"You guys are overdramatic, those footballers work all the time with shady people it wont bother them much.

"Who's good enough to be at a top club? 

United - Rashford (Garnacho unknown)

City - Foden (Lewis unknown)

Liverpool - Trent (Elliot unknown)

Chelsea - James and Mount 

Spurs - Kane (Skipp unknown)

Arsenal - Saka

Academies don't constantly produce top level talent, 1 or 2 players in a 6 year time frame is quite normal.",Manchester United,Yes,j6yakc1,t1_j6y9aq2
Who are the elite young players that’ve come through at City? Foden and..?,Manchester United,Yes,j6ybdwq,t1_j6y9aq2
"City buys players around 16 years old, has them spend a year or two in the academy, then loans/sells them for a profit. It's more of a money-making scheme than actually ""developing"" players. The majority of players people point to as ""academy products"" barely spent any time there at all. Sancho, Lavia, Bazunu, etc. none of these guys were developed by City's academy. They were all signed fairly late in their youth careers and didn't play much for the actual academy.

We signed Garnacho as an older academy player and even he spent more time in our academy than any of those players mentioned above did at City, not to mention he's still playing with us in the first team. Rashford, McTominay, and the kid in the news today all joined us when they were 5-7 years old. Foden's the only good example of a player being developed by their academy and becoming a regular first team player there. Rico Lewis will be another soon.

Their entire structure has largely amounted to ""it's easy to make money when you have money"". Spend a shit ton on players old enough that they're already quite developed and will likely be able to be sold for a profit in a couple of years. It's not at all about development. It's an easy way to make money, but only really possible when you have an absurd amount of money to begin with. That's why only Chelsea and City have consistently pulled it off. They just eat the losses when they happen.

Also, we've completely overhauled our academy structure in the past few years and are investing a crazy amount into in now as well. We've come really far and are back to being one of the best again. It's an impressive turnaround.",Manchester United,Yes,j6ymahs,t1_j6y9aq2
"Our youth team is in a pretty good place though. We won the Fa Youth Cup just last year. Garnacho, Mainoo, Hannibal, Iqbal, Shoretire, Savage, McNeil, Mengi, Laird and Fernandez are all players in recent years that we've developed in the youth team. All of them have featured for us in the first team or have gotten loans",Manchester United,Yes,j6yagu3,t1_j6y9aq2
Garnacho ?,Manchester United,Yes,j6y9mbl,t1_j6y9aq2
"Our youth system was revamped back in the day by Rene Moulesteen and we constantly see potential first team players since then.

"Second, what SAF does.
It is much more efficient to (in my opinion) to be flexible in tactics, basically more tools in your box. However this requires the whole team and players to understand their roles, and heavily rely on the manager’s plan.

I always think that is what Ole try to replicate to a certain extent. Which is why we perform much better vs stronger opponents during the 19-21 two seasons.",Manchester United,Yes,j6wo087,t1_j6wmyyv

He could have gone through with the act or put his pants back on and fucked off. 

We don't know for sure based on that clip alone.

I'll just say this, if it was just limited to domestic abuse and not rape, he can probably salvage his career.

There are players who were **convicted** of domestic abuse still playing.

Koman, Hernandez, Boateng were all convicted and still went on to have successful careers.

In his case, the charges are dropped. Apologizing for domestic abuse is a lot more palatable than rape.

"Yes no other options but still better to experiment now in a game that is dead to see if lindelof can be a possible backup in that role over coming weeks given we have reasonably good CB options (at least until mcT is back and we have 4 cm options again with cas, Fred, mcT and sabitzer.

ETH said after the game of lindelofs history at benfica that he was trained and has played in that position before and can do it. It’s not a long term solution obv or someone that is ever gonna compete with Casemiro for starts, but the window is closed now, we need to make do with what we have so using lindelof as a CM, and sancho as a 10 (2 areas we are light in numbers due to eriksen / donny injuries) is good management and potentially helps build confidence in those 2 players that they can fill that position if called on",Manchester United,Yes,j6wden3,t1_j6wapzd

Will he be able to handle the songs other clubs' fans will sing every game he partakes in?

What would happen if he goes off the straight and narrow again in the future?

I personally think he should be let go. If he signs for another club and gets a great career, tough luck. It's not a fact that the club will miss out on trophies without him, but with him, there will always be people pointing fingers at him and the club.",Manchester United,Yes,j6x5795,t1_j6x1z93

">Hes not played/trained properly for over a year now

I would not be surprised if the club allowed him to train behind closed doors or he himself hiring someone to keep him fit. The worst thing a club can do it allow a player to stew in their thoughts for far too long. Working out helps keep the mind distracted from all the pressure around him over the year.


>And thats all hypothetical because i just dont see the club accepting him back, they'll pay out his contract and let him leave at the end of the season i expect.

Likewise I don't see any logic in a club letting a talented player leave on a free. Any football club would die to have someone of his talent in their squad. I see the club cashing in on him, not letting him go when he clearly has a lot of value in the market. 

I feel like if we shed aside our judgement towards him based on the evidence we have, he's a talent we have on our books. Makes no sense to let him go on something arbitrary as sentiment.

But that's not what happened. The Police/CPS conducted near 12 months of investigations with more evidence, more people available to interview/question than we as fans/average joe had and all charges were dropped against him.

All we're doing rn is using a 30 sec audio snipped from a 12 minute recording and branding him guilty of being a rapist/domestic abuser/guy who threatened to kill someone else. Remember the CPS stated that ""combination of the withdrawal of key witnesses and new material that came to light meant there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction"". We have no fucking clue why the key witnesses pulled out, or what these new ""evidences"" they received that led to the charges being dropped are.

The same market which is being propped up by Chelsea itself? Because I don't see any other club overspending like this right now. Arsenal tried to sign Mudryk and stopped once the price got too high. I am sure many clubs would sign Enzo as well on a reasonable fee. The market is being propped up by Chelsea itself. They literally spent more than all other PL clubs combined.

"Bail terms would be set within the first couple of days of being charged as we have a legal right to speedy processing there and for our charges to be read in case we've been wrongly arrested and it's blatantly obvious.

Charges were applied the moment he was arrested in the case. So it goes:

1. Police made aware

2. Police arrest you under suspicion of offences

3. Within 24 hours of you being held you must be charged or a judge allows extended custody (which is rarely granted now because it's an abuse of power to do it)

4. If not charged off you go until they can arrest you and charge you at same time. If charged then with 24-72 hours your bail conditions are set.

5. Then comes the very lengthy process of evidence gathering by the CPS and your own solicitor. You can also enter an early plea deal too and the CPS will make an offer too normally depending upon evidence.

6. During this they negotiate with the courts a trial date. Courts.will step in and just set a date if they can't agree within a few days of asking. 

7. At some point a senior prosecutor will review the case and decide if they proceed or drop it.

8. If dropped you can be charged again in the future. If not dropped you're going to trial and usually around now is when the last minute plea deals are sent out.

9. Trial. This can take years to happen (his would have been November of this year, nearly two years later)


Worth noting, at no point in this do they need a victims permission to proceed. The UK CPS can choose to prosecute without needing the victim to say they want to and can instead proceed under ""public interest"". This was what they were doing here the whole time.

Apologies for the screen cancer but just using this list of the top rated players back in 2010 very few actually go on to that top level. Chelsea are basically buying a sub section of that list, who knows maybe they will pick amazingly but the odds are against them

"> but so far outside of Antony avoidable overpayment Arnold, Murtough and co have been at least competent

It's tough to blame that on them too. We don't know what happened behind the scenes.

"One sunny day doesn't mean it won't rain again. Still unsure on those making the decisions on the club until they can prove they can stand on their own two-feet and not largely rely on what ETH has worked with/knows of well.

Yes a manager has to be consulted on transfers but when we were mostly signing players who played under ETH or a player who ETH wanted at Ajax prior (Malacia). That leaves Casemiro who's a known entity to say the least, Weghorst and Sabitzer who whilst might be solid for the rest of the season, are stop-gaps and still a bit too early to judge them (though Weghorst has looked promising so far).

How on earth is this your opinion?

Like if we put the sunglasses on to hide the new shiny shiny. The glazers have managed to replace a player on 500k with a loan option for 35k. Then one of the few midfielders we needed in the summer has been brought in last ditch as a player who was supposed to be a back up in the first place got injured. Off the back of us being lied to about being unable to sign anymore permanent deals or loans all window.

>we’ve spent next to nothing.

"Well let’s assume the buyers of Chelsea aren’t stupid (and tbf they likely aren’t).

They must be extremely confident that Chelsea will be worth a lot more than £4.5bn in the future.

And I think they might be right.

The current premier league to deal is £4.5bn and is up for renewal in 2025. That figure is only going to go up, especially given Amazon are now involved. As that and other rights deals (champions league, europa league, etc) go up the value of Chelsea will follow.

Then there’s the discussion of PremFlix. Obviously it’s only a discussion but research suggest clubs would make many times on broadcasting revenue than they do now.

The European Super League is also an ever present, though I think it’s virtually impossible in the UK currently.

All told, the premier league teams are only going to get richer and therefore more valuable.

Their purchase (and ours) may seem like savvy deals in a decade.

And as for choosing Newcastle or Everton, what if the European Super League does rear it’s head in the next few years. If you are only interested in money, you are going to wish you had forked out more for Chelsea rather than sticking with lesser teams.",Manchester United,Yes,j6sy4ot,t1_j6rqg94

I'd like us to be in for Caicedo. Tbh Bellingham isn't the top priority for us,Manchester United,Yes,j6rif2g,t1_j6rhoec
"I really want us to go for **Kane**. I think he'd be perfect for our team, give us 3-4 years of 20+ goals per season, and give us time to find and integrate his replacement. At £80m I think it's a no-brainer. At £120m I think it's a non-starter.

**FDJ** is worth trying for again, but moving on quickly if it looks like it's not going to happen. **Milinkovic-Savic** could be an excellent addition for the right price. It sounds like he's looking to move on this summer.

Lastly, although I didn't think it made sense earlier in the season, getting **Skriniar** on a free could be an excellent bit of business to then have 3 top-tier CBs to rotate in the 2 positions. He may not be keen on that though if PSG are going to offer him a first XI position.

We obviously still need a GK and maybe a backup RB (Malacia equivalent would be ideal). All of the keepers we've been linked with previously would cost £50m+, so I think that's going to be a difficult one to fill without swallowing a huge chunk of our budget.",Manchester United,Yes,j6rjn9y,t1_j6rhoec
"As of right now, we might have a legit shot at Bellingham as long as we can afford him. The rumor was he would go to Liverpool but look at the state of their team right now. We may be able to offer UCL football, great squad, great manager and hopefully a trophy if we beat Newcastle. Bellingham would slot in perfectly next to Casemiro so if we play our cards, our chances are significantly higher than last season.

"To be honest, besides the world cup, I haven't watched a lot of him and I suspect he'd have costed half of that putting the world cup aside. Nonetheless, a good signing I think but that'd a lot of money, albeit being paid in installments. I think if we add another box to box playmaker next season and world class striker and maybe another RW on top of Amad who's less of a run in behind the by line type of player we are good.
The bad news is that with Chelseas model, they can still afford to spend another 200 to 300 mil in the summer with outgoings so expect them to pretty much be in for all the marquee players including Kane.",Manchester United,Yes,j6rj4s3,t1_j6reuez

"Spurs haven't improved, their downfall this season has been defence. Porro doesn't defensively help them, so they still have to play games with 2 of Sanchez, Dier, Davies and Lenglet in the XI. Talking about CBs that would be behind Maguire for us.",Manchester United,Yes,j6spg0f,t1_j6sjod9
They've spent €600m and still don't have someone who's going to put the ball in the net,Manchester United,Yes,j6ssobs,t1_j6snl23
"The big players there for me are Mudryk and Felix - and Felix is only on loan.

Mudryk, on the other hand, I think is an outstanding footballer. He's not just a pace merchant, either - he's got incredibly quick feet, excellent passing and dribbling, and he's creative - he's got a good footballing brain. As long as he works hard and is hungry, they've got an amazing player on their hands.

The other high-profile players I'm not too worried about.

Enzo's a great player, but he's not at the level of a truly world-ruling midfielder like an elite, peak Modric, Xavi, Zidane, Keane, Scholes, or Casemiro. They're obviously different players, but pick a midfield role and he's nowhere near that level.

Badiashile is decent value at his price and I would assume people will eventually think they've got a great deal there, but it's offset by spending about 60% more than they needed to on Fofana.

They've got another Fofana up front as a gamble, which may look like a good deal in the future, but he's not an elite level striker now - so we don't have that worry.

Chukwuemeka is a good player, but what's the plan? Rotation and sub minutes forever? Weird one for him, because he's easily capable right now at his age to be playing for a good PL team.

Madueke? Very exciting, technical player with a lot of creativity. But he's injured most of the time, and when he isn't... where is he playing? On Felix's shoulders? They've got Mount, Ziyech, Pulisic, Havertz, Sterling, and probably more players that can play through the middle or on the right.

In short, they look a bit messy in terms of squad composition, but has some very good footballers in it when everyone is fit. Young defence with Chilwell, James, and two young CBs (Badiashile and Fofana), a strong midfield core (Enzo, Kovacic), and plenty of options up front. If Nkunku is supposed to be their striker, so be it - but I'd imagine they're missing a proper striker and that's basically it.

When looking at their squad as a whole, it looks even more messy because of all the poor players they've brought in - like spending 30m+ on Koulibaly - and the mediocre players that they're probably not intending to rely on long-term - like Mount, Gallagher, and RLC. At least they're moving on and not feeling like they're stuck with them, though. That's what we've struggled with.

Of the big-money buys, only Mudryk I think is truly one of the players that people will be insanely jealous of. Maybe some of the cheaper buys will come good and look like genius transfers in the coming years. But right now, their biggest scary players are Felix and Mudryk.",Manchester United,Yes,j6swen8,t1_j6snl23

"His full two seasons were good.

I think he was ok and there were many games which were entertaining. You could also see his strengths regarding counter attacking football.

But ultimately he wasn’t good enough to be at Utd. Unless you are a very experienced and respected manager, you need to be the head coach as well and on the training pitch (with the requisite ability).

He also left too many issues unresolved. Some of that wasn’t his fault (elements of recruitment) but others were (false promises to players - see Lingard, Bailly and Henderson). It all came to head in his final 6 months and couple that with the addition of Ronaldo which screwed the dressing room and tactics, it was a perfect storm for a catastrophe.

The PE teacher tag is disrespectful though.",Manchester United,Yes,j6swi9c,t1_j6rshbb
"I would argue the opposite about deadwood with Ole. He gave new contracts to players who should never have received them e.g Jones and Mata.

 He also ran the contract down on players who were clearly either not invested at United or would go on to leave on a free transfer such as pogba and lingard.

"If we do sell Donny and Scott while keeping Sabitzer, then really the only additional midfielder we'd need would be a DM to be Casemiro's backup and understudy. Fred, Sabitzer and Eriksen can play as the 8, then obviously Bruno, Eriksen and Sabitzer can play as the 10 and the only issue remaining is that Casemiro has no backup.",Manchester United,Yes,j6t7xu6,t1_j6t19zg

"I think that Arnold and Murtaugh deserve praise for their work because they seem to be operating in conjunction with the manager (as a team) rather than against the mamager which we have seen previously. 

I don't believe that ""ETH's work is buying them a lot of good faith"" because that good work is dependent on the recruitment department providing the types of players that ten Hag requires. While we may have paid a bit much for someone like Antony, it is clear that the manager has identified necessary player roles and that Murtaugh is able to work on bringing that type of player in - hence why Sabitzer can be brought in quickly rather than getting into a pissing contest over Enzo Fernandez (or why we got Weghorst in rather than chasing the flavour of the World Cup striker). The two departments (coaching and recruitment) are operating together as they should be and the success of one informs the other - just as good recruitment makes coaching easier, good coaching makes recruitment easier.

Contrast this with the Woodward era and we only need to go back about 18 months to see how this can go terribly wrong. Before we signed Ronaldo it was clear that we needed a midfielder and it was widely reported that Ole had asked for one to close the window. Instead he got a forward that didn't fit his plans and it completely fucked the season and cost Ole his job.

Is this the minimum standard that we should expect? Absolutely. Has our club met this standard in the recent past? Nope. Is Director of Football a high criticism, low praise role? Yep. So I'm going to praise good behaviour here rather than playing hard to please.",Manchester United,Yes,j6sxb5s,t1_j6sos53
"Smart deals and cheap signings will always exist as other leagues simply can't compete with the PL. PL clubs will just step in and hijack deals.

Players will always have contracts running out where a club is forced to sell or risk losing them on a free.

Expensive signings are only going to be the norm if you have poor scouting and are buying players who are only a year or two into their new contract and have started to make a name for themselves.

3) all this means is money helps in football which has always been the case. Teams like United in the 90s far outspent our rivals and regularly got beat to tournaments, only won one Champions League as well. PSG and City have had absurd amounts of cash compared to rivals for years now and still can't win the Champions league and Chelsea, which people are yet to realise, have achieved fuck all.",Manchester United,Yes,j6rxbw4,t1_j6rtlmx
"If anything the Glazers have proven that spending big doesn’t necessarily bring success. What matters most is that there’s a football vision at the club and that players fit a certain criteria. You can always recruit the right players for cheap so long as you have competent people at the club. 

I’m still unconvinced about Murtough and Arnold but it’s undeniable that they’ve shown ambition with Ten Hag. On one hand they’ve definitely overspent on certain players, but more recently they’ve managed to get Sabitzer on loan which strikes me as uncharacteristically competent. Moving forward I’m hopeful that we will continue to make smart moves like that. 

It’s hard not to be salty about Chelsea at the moment, but what they’re doing now could very well backfire.",Manchester United,Yes,j6rxy87,t1_j6rtlmx

"Well tbh the Glazers have spent money on big players in the past and big contracts and that's a huge part of the reason for our lack of finances (on top of other reasons) and the reason they are selling the club.

www.bbc.com/sport/football/64231986.amp,Manchester United,Yes,j6re61y,t1_j6rduue
", let’s actually look at your argument, you’re speaking like replacing a player on 500k who didn’t fit the system with a loan who does fit the system for considerably less is bad business?

Again, we replaced a key injured member of the squad with arguably an upgrade for next to nothing.

The crux of your argument seems to be that we should be spending loads of money and that I should be mad that we’re not because somehow in your baboon brain, this means I side with the glazers?

Let me be clear I couldn’t give a flying fuck how much money we spend, the amount of almost irrelevant, the idea is getting the right players in. We’ve spent loads of money in the past and where has it got us? Fucking no where. Meanwhile we’ve watched our biggest rivals not spend as much but spend well and win everything.

So what you wanted, is for the club to go out and spend a load of money this January? On who? We need a striker, a good one, at the moment the only two out there really are Kane and Osimhen. You go and ask for them in January and see what you get told? Anyone else? And don’t say jonathan fucking David because let me tell you, id rather have Kane or Osihmen and if we spend on David now we aren’t getting either.

We’re we going to get a midfielder if Eriksen wasn’t injured? No probably not but he is and we did, and we got one arguably just as good, I really don’t understand why you are against this.

Finally just on the concept of spending in January in general, and why we didn’t get any permanent deals, you do realise the club is being sold right? Probably in a few months time, why on earth would we spend a fuck load of money on players? Firstly the glazers just wouldn’t but secondly we’re going to have a new structure, new money etc for the summer, we literally start fresh. The fact these are loans are good because if they’re shit we can assess in summer and actually get who need. Or would you prefer we spent 120 mil on enzo and gave him a 10 year contract on 300k a week?

">	The two departments (coaching and recruitment) are operating together as they should be and the success of one informs the other - just as good recruitment makes coaching easier, good coaching makes recruitment easier.

I feel like you’re applying a narrative there that we don’t really know is accurate at this point. At best it’s speculation as to what is going on behind the scenes. (As is anything I say)

ETH has made quiet a bit of noise, relatively speaking, in both January and the Summer to suggest we need to be doing more regards squad overhaul (in and out). He’s applying pressure externally imo which isn’t an indication they all see eye to eye.

Ultimately we don’t know yet, maybe never will, how joined up the thinking is, how collaborative it is.

Better than before, not good enough is my take so far without forensically analysing every single publicly handled issue so far. 

To be clear, I’m not saying they should be dragged over coals but the squad planning between summer and this month has left something be desired imo.

"I'm not applying a narrative, I'm looking at the things we know have happened and drawing conclusions from them about the operations of our recruitment. When we sign players now, they fit what the manager wants. Sure, we're shopping in the bargain bin due to finances but no player has come in such that you wonder how the manager will use that player. The players that come in are getting game time and not sitting on the bench because they don't fit. And that is a sign that the manager and recruitment department are on the same page. In the past this has not been true (DvB anyone?).

Speaking of the press conferences, I see ten Hag as just being honest. From what I've seen, I wouldn't say that he has been applying pressure to the recruitment department, just calling it as he sees it. And, to the extent that finances will allow, he has gotten the players that he's asked for. Also, have you read any reports that United's upper management is displeased about ten Hag's comments about transfers? I sure haven't, which indicates that he and the club are on the same page. Usually when a manager goes out and talks about transfers like ten Hag does you get some blowback from the club leaders who are trying to protect their own rep. United hasn't so I take that as a good sign.

The only way to be further along in this process is to go back in time and make the return of Ronaldo never happen. Then we could conceivably have added quality midfielders a year sooner and entrenched ourselves in the top 3 spots.

If anything, you are applying a narrative that before ten Hag everything was shit, nothing was worth saving, and the whole thing needed to be burnt to the ground. The irony is that ten Hag is proving that to be wrong by helping players to put last season behind them and regain confidence. Between ten Hag and the recruitment team they have made smart decisions and removed a cancer from the locker room.

"We're all speculating. I just choose to do so based on things that are not themselves second-hand speculations. There's no point trying to draw conclusions on ""paper talk"" given that we have no way of verifying any of it. Therefore I try to look at what is happening on the field and work backwards from there.

Again, you act like the club was full of useless players when ten Hag arrived. That is a narrative that set in through last season despite those players showing quality in the previous two seasons. Sure, there was deserved questions about whether those players could put 21/22 behind them but the narrative that everyone was useless is way too far. Players like Wan-Bissaka are proving critics wrong right now because ten Hag has put them in positions to succeed rather than just writing them off. If ten Hag took the same mentality of people like you we would have had to clear out 25 players and replace them with 25 new ones. But thank god he sees the players' qualities and puts them to use.

I'll repeat myself: the only way to be further along than we are right now is if we go back in time and make Ronaldo's return not happen and sign someone like Casemiro instead. The fact that we're ""re-building"" rather than ""transitioning from safe top 4 finisher to title challenger"" is all down to the absolute stupidity of that transfer that not only ruined play on the field but also fucked the dressing room. Change that one thing and the middle of last season should have looked like what it is right now. And none of that can be laid at the feet of Arnold, Murtaugh, or ten Hag. Signing Ronaldo was either before their time or came from above their heads (and in ten Hag's case is the reason he's even here). I don't know what exactly you expect them to do that they haven't done already - and it is to their credit that we made good signings, got rid of Ronaldo, and are in a good position on the field.

With regards to the money, have you looked at United's financial position? Do you understand why we're in the position that we're in? If you did you'd understand that it is a product of shitty decision making over the last 10 years, most of which was at the hands of a different CEO with no Director of Football. We've compounded bad transfers with mega-contracts that make it hard to sell players on and that affects so much of what we're able to do in terms of both incomings and outgoings. So Arnold, Murtaugh, and ten Hag have a question: do you accept this reality and do your best within it or do you choose to whine about it and throw your toys out of the pram? They have clearly chosen the former and are doing well, in my opinion, within those circumstances.",Manchester United,Yes,j6tctj9,t1_j6t5z6v

Yes. Do you understand that we could still be managing it differently since the summer. 10 years of mismanagement was not going to be wiped away in one summer, however, that does not mean we couldn’t have done better with where we were this summer. 

Anyway, just curious to peoples opinions for seemingly buying the Murtaugh/Arnold puff piece in the papers the other day and off the back of a couple loans. 

Personally I’m not yet convinced they shouldn’t be doing better.",Manchester United,Yes,j6tgyf0,t1_j6tctj9
"Ok, let's go through this slowly:

You have made a number of speculations based on hearsay: opinions made in the media about what may or may not be going on behind the scenes. ""We know that there are players that do not fit ten Hag's playstyle"" is a fantastic example as ten Hag has not said anything like that publicly and all we have to go on to evaluate that statement is what happens on the field and who gets played. As an example, we knew that Ronaldo wasn't rated by ten Hag because he wasn't playing when he was available to do so. On the other hand, I am confining my commentary to factual occurences and drawing conclusions from them. Case in point, if all the players that are signed get played, then we can assume that the manager and recruitment team are on the same page. That's not a leap based on supposition - just looking at what has happened.

Your entire argument here is based on an assumption that most of the players at the club were or are deadwood that needs to be replaced. You've implied this numerous times. Really, you'd be more honest if you'd just say it out loud rather than just implying it though. 

So, you're clearly upset that they aren't replacing the useless players fast enough. If you start from a position that everyone sucks then your impatience makes sense. But you've eliminated the possibility that many of the players don't actually need replacement. And I would say, based on who gets played and how they have played, that the manager does not agree with you.

Lastly, just limiting your analysis of the financial situation to this last summer is naive. Manchester United should be able to go through a spend like we did in summer 2022 every once in a while when it is necessary. Sometimes you have to pay up to get the players that you want and that's what we did last summer. The reality is that we needed players in key positions and we went out and got them. But that in and of itself is not why we're in this position. The fact that the last 10 years were so badly managed is why a big spend in one summer is crippling and not just a blip in operations. The options were to not spend on necessary players and conserve funds until big contracts are off the books (and risk missing out on top 4) or to spend now to achieve results on the field and balance things long-term with a better strategy.

I'll finish by asking you what specifically they should be doing better? What should reasonably have been done that would earn a good evaluation from you?",Manchester United,Yes,j6tldei,t1_j6tgyf0

"Number 1 for me is the handling of the Ronaldo saga from the summer and letting it drag on till the World Cup. 

They should’ve taken control of that in the summer when he went AWOL instead of dumping it on ETH to try smooth over publicly while being undermined at every turn. 

A new manger barely behind the desk, clear as day where it would all end up but they let Ronaldo drive the narrative rather than being decisive. 

Embarrassing leadership treating the player as bigger than the club. Lost half a season to that drama.

Number 2 Arnold meeting fans in the pub and banging on about how much money there is to spend while subsequently failing to get the player they were after and then scrambling around with Rabiot etc toward the deadline. Embarrassing carry on.

Number 3 If ETH was forcing the FDJ thing then be a leader and put an end to it sooner of you know it’s going nowhere.

Number 4 Paper thin squad heading into an absolutely crazy run, needed more bodies (clearly plenty loan options around) only bring in a midfielder when we lose one because fans would lose it. Where is the short/medium/long term squad planning?

Number 5 Moving on players the manager clearly doesn’t rate/trust to free up funds. Nothing about them being bad players, but several clearly aren’t trusted and/or reliable. Move them on, bring in cheaper alternatives who do fit the managers preferred playing style. 

Fear of selling decent players has been a massive issue under Woodward as well.",Manchester United,Yes,j6toagv,t1_j6tmilb
"Ok, those are all good points. I would say that there are mitigating circumstances to each of them though which I'll go through below.

I agree with you on Number 1 (that Ronaldo should have been gone in May), but I understand that there is a lot more going on there than just telling him to get lost. He was under contract and up until the Piers Morgan interview showed no interest in just being cut loose without either another club lined up or getting a pay out. I have to think that if the situation lined up that United would have gotten rid. But it didn't so we had to keep him for longer. As it was I think they played that one well to avoid having to pay him out.

With number 2, I would agree that it is unwise to brag about how much money is there (a la Woodward's ""other clubs can only dream of"" speech). But that in and of itself is just posturing that doesn't change the reality of any prospective deal and the ability to get it over the line. So he can have a minus for bragging and getting fans' hopes up, but that's all I'd read into that.

With FdJ, there was way too much media smoke around that scenario to know what was really us pushing too long versus reporters trying to get clicks. On one hand, United could have asked for him in May, got told ""no"" by the player, and then moved on. On the other hand, ten Hag could have been calling FdJ right up to the deadline. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle but I think we can be happy with how the business turned out in the end.

For number 4, do we really have a ""thin"" squad in terms of the number of players in the first team squad? We're not quite current Chelsea (with about 10 extra players) but until McTominay and Eriksen got hurt we had enough bodies to cover. And if we have enough bodies then the question is how much improvement a loaned-in player would bring on such short notice, which is a case-by-case evaluation. But the injuries forced the issue and we got a player in (which is a credit to the club on such a short timeline).

Number 5 is about the only place that I absolutely disagree with you. This assumes a lot about who the manager rates or doesn't rate. There are plenty of players who are getting their chance and doing well that might have started the season as out of favour. If the manager is happy to have them as a backup and is finding a use for them, there is no need to sell and replace. And we don't have many players who aren't getting playing time at the minute and even fewer who aren't doing the job asked of them. My only criticism in this area is that players currently on loan (e.g. Telles, Bailly) weren't sold outright as we will still have to deal with them again down the road (but at least they're gone for now). Do I think we have players who should be sold? Absolutely, but I also understand that this work needs to be done gradually and as it currently stands we don't have the ability to change that much that quickly. If we don't move on and replace those players next summer then I'll start to get upset but I have no real complaints at the minute about what has happened.",Manchester United,Yes,j6tuled,t1_j6toagv
"Watching the game mate so I’ll just clarify for number 5 that my main complaint there, if we assume ETH doesn’t fancy some of them which is an assumption for sure, is that we have way too many expensive (fee and salary) bench players (if they are even ever available at all).

I’ll single out Maguire here, not that I think he’s a bad player, but Chelsea would have taken him it seems clear. It’s clear he’s the backup at best. We could have found a suitable  bench option for less of a fee and lower wages im sure. 

We’d have taken a loss on him no doubt but that isn’t going to change this summer. Sunk cost fallacy holding on to these players imo.",Manchester United,Yes,j6tvkkl,t1_j6tuled
"Cheers!

I think that's a matter of timing though. In the middle of the season do you stick with Maguire as the backup option (who has worked with the manager and hasn't shown any inclination to agitate for a move) or try to bed in a new player on the fly? To me, that's something you do in the summer and we've discussed why last summer wasn't really an option (already spent a lot on players). At this point as long as you don't give them a new contract to be a bench player there's no harm in having them around until the offseason (or longer if everyone is happy).

That's why I don't have complaints about the job done to date. Yes, we can't get caught up in the sunk cost fallacy but we need to analyze what is a priority problem versus a tinkering around the edges problem. We don't really have players complaining about their role, the manager seems to be giving everyone chances (i.e. not pulling an Ole and writing people off), and the team is succeeding on the field. If in the summer they decide to sell someone like Maguire and replace him with a younger, cheaper player that works for me. But I completely understand why there weren't 20 out and 20 in over the last summer.",Manchester United,Yes,j6u1ujs,t1_j6tvkkl
